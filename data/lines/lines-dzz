Five dead.
Frigate's under quarantine.
William:
Quarantine?
By whose order?
Sentry:
George Sibley.
By way of his wife, Mary Sibley.
Mary:
Does a man desire to know when he is on the precipice of his own death?
What say you, George?
Would your friend, the blacksmith, want to know that scant hours from now,
Mercy Lewis will accuse him of witchcraft?
From which his trial and execution will swiftly follow?
Or would he favor his waning moments be spent in ignorance?
Oh, don't pity him, George.
It is the blood of innocents like your friend that make our grand rite possible.
Each accusation made, each trial convened not for us, but by us.
No one the wiser to our plan and nobody brave enough to stand in our way.
Anne:
You miss them, don't you?
John:
When I was young,
I thought them horribly sensible people.
Now...
Salem could use more like them.
Anne:
I'm intruding, captain.
John:
No, no.
I'm glad you're amongst the lmng...
So to speak.
Word was you had taken quite ill.
Anne:
Indeed.
A fit that came on suddenly and without reason, followed by a restless sleep in which the sickness infected even my dreams.
John:
Your dreams?
Anne:
I dreamt of a doll with eyes full and black.
And when I awoke, feverish in the night's middle,
I could have sworn the doll was there, staring back at me.
John:
Fever dreams can be quite vmd.
Anne:
Except I could have sworn that I saw my father enter in darkness and remove the doll.
But when I asked, he laughed and assured me that...
John:
You were dreaming.
Anne:
Do you doubt my father's veracity, captain Alden?
John:
No.
But it seems like you do.
Anne:
I...
I have no doubt that he's a good man.
But lately...
John:
What?
Mr. Hale:
Had I but known you were in such safe hands,
I would have spared your mother her worry.
John:
Magistrate.
Mr. Hale:
Come along, Anne.
Let us allow captain Alden his privacy.
Cotton:
Have I heard you correctly?
Are you suggesting that Anne Hale is the victim of...
John:
A spell.
Cotton:
Am I, too, the victim of a spell?
Or has John Alden finally declared his belief in witches?
John:
I've seen too much to deny any longer, making my next step obvious...
Catching one.
Gloriana: [ Laughs ]
Cotton:
As you know, apprehending a witch is no easy feat.
John:
Unless you know who they are.
Cotton:
Have you uncovered the conjurer who spelled Anne?
Who is it?
Tell me.
John:
Someone in proximity to his victim.
Cotton:
Yes.
John:
Whose own daughter voices her suspicions.
Cotton:
Magistrate Hale?
John:
He's not who he seems.
Cotton:
Who amongst us is?
You?
Or I?
Who among us is unburdened by shame or secrets that we hide from the world?
Gloriana: [ Laughs ]
Cotton:
I'm reverend mather.
Is there a problem?
William:
Well, no.
The lady and I were just discussing some business.
- Cotton:
Business?
- William:
Yes.
As in how much it might cost me to get down to some.
Cotton:
This is a reputable establishment!
It offers no place for your lechery.
- William:
Reverend.
- John:
Reverend.
Cotton!
William:
Pardon me.
I apologize if I've caused any offense.
Good day.
Cotton:
Do you know that man?
John:
Never seen him before.
Children:
♪ ring around the rosies
♪ pocketful of posies
♪ ashes, ashes
♪ we all fall down [ sizzling ]
Blacksmith:
Ah. [ Laughs ] Yeah.
Tituba:
She has arrived.
Mary:
Mercy.
My dear, this is a blessing.
Reverend Lewis:
Truly.
And she is again well enough to breathe the fall air.
[ Chuckles ]
Mary:
Our deepest gratitude is often saved for what we once took for granted.
Mercy: [ Breathing heavily ]
[ Wheezing ]
Mary:
Mercy?
- What is it?
- Reverend Lewis:
No.
No, my child.
No.
No.
Mercy: [ Breathing heavily ]
The witch!
Young woman:
Who's the witch, Mercy?
!
Tell us!
Who's the witch?
!
Is he the witch, Mercy?
- Is he?
!
- Mercy: [ Crying ]
[ Screams ]
Reverend Lewis:
Mercy!
Mercy!
Help!
Will someone help us?
!
Tituba:
What's happened?
Mary:
We've lost control.
She is no longer ours.
Mr. Hale:
The hive is restless.
Some are beginning to doubt your grand vision for our kind.
Mary:
Who?
Give me their names.
Rose:
You're missing the point, child.
Mary:
Then perhaps he should make one.
Mr. Hale:
Trials are preceded by accusations.
And accusations are predicated upon your control of the girl.
Rose:
The hunter's moon fast approaches.
Mr. Hale:
Yet the blacksmith still blithely peddles his wares, his blood lost to our cause.
Tituba:
How dare you.
Before Mary, we were not feared, but fearful, not hunters, but prey.
And yet does her strength and vision garner your praise?
No.
Only your doubt.
Mary:
The girl has been rendered frail by her circumstance.
Nothing more.
My mastery is not of issue.
Rose:
This is an assurance?
Mary:
She needs but a moment of rest.
After which, she will again be strong enough to point the finger.
Mr. Hale:
Yet another issue remains...
That of John Alden.
Mary:
What of him?
Mr. Hale:
His suspicion of me is palpable.
If she cannot abate his threat, then I will be forced to do so myself... as I see fit.
Rose:
Should you desire John Alden's trust,
I would suggest you find a way to earn it.
And, Mary...
Your vision guides us.
I will report to the others that your plan shall resume anon.
Tituba:
We need answers quickly.
Mary:
And we will get them.
Tituba:
How?
Mary:
The quickest way one finds answers...
Blame.
Is it your intent to rob me of my remaining faith in you, reverend?
Cotton:
Mrs. Sibley.
I didn't hear you arrive.
Mary:
Your charge, simple and clear, is to protect the Lewis girl from further possession.
And yet... was the episode in the marketplace not evidence of exactly that?
Cotton:
We have no proof it was the work of witches.
Mary:
So you've paid her a visit, then?
You've determined what ails her?
Cotton:
The pastor says she's resting and best not be disturbed.
Mary:
May I ask you a question, reverend?
When your father seeks out demons, does he ask permission?
Does he knock on doors and offer to come back at a more convenient time?
Or does he, armed with the lord's righteousness, demand the demon answer to him?
Cotton:
My father and I are different men.
We work in different ways.
Mary:
When I summoned a hunter of witches to protect the people of Salem, it was not you I requested.
Yet it was you who arrived on our shores.
Do not make me regret settling for my second choice.
Mr. Hale:
Captain Alden.
How fortuitous.
I was just about to set this on your doorstep.
I'll spare you the mystery.
It's a reception tomorrow evening in your honor.
John:
A reception?
No.
That's not necessary.
Mr. Hale:
But it is.
You're a selectman now.
And, on a more personal note, a chance to make amends for my less-than-hospitable behavior since your return.
Can we trust you'll be in attendance?
John:
Excuse me, magistrate.
Lieutenant Hooke.
William:
John Alden.
Now, is this any way to greet the man who saved you from those savages?
John:
What the hell are you doing here?
William:
Business, captain.
There is a vessel in port on which I have cargo.
And until the quarantine is lifted,
I am marooned here in your little witch town.
John:
We had a deal, and it was a simple one...
That I was never to set eyes on you again.
William:
Yes.
Well, you needn't worry.
We're not the same men we were in the war.
But...
There is something you could do to hasten my departure.
John:
What is that?
William:
The girl you spoke of in battle...
Mary Wolcott.
Although she's Mary Sibley now, isn't she?
An introduction with her would certain...
John:
You stay away from Mary.
William:
Or what, John?
What will you do?
John:
What I should have done last time.
William: [ Scoffs ]
Now, careful, captain.
Before a man makes threats, he should take stock of what he risks...
Unless you do not mind me telling the good people of Salem just who John Alden really is...
Neither the man nor the war hero he purports to be.
John:
I want you to finish your business with all due haste, and then by coach or by steed or by ship, I want you gone.
William:
You have my word.
Mary:
Mr. Sibley's feeding will have to wait until I return from the reception.
George: [ Groans ]
[ Groaning ]
William:
Excuse me.
Mrs. Sibley.
Mary:
And you are?
William:
I'm Hooke...
William Hooke.
Forgive my boldness, but I wondered if I might speak to you of your ship detained in port.
Mary:
As you've doubtless heard, it's under quarantine.
William:
Well, 'tis no bother.
I merely mean to board the vessel and retrieve my cargo.
Mary:
And risk infection?
Or worse?
Well, this must be very valuable cargo, Mr. Hooke.
Sorry.
No one's permitted on board.
William:
Well, perhaps Mr. Sibley will be more open to reason.
Mary:
I can assure you, Mr. Hooke, my husband and I are of one mind on all matters.
Good evening.
Cotton:
Mercy, if you can hear me, I beseech you, speak to me the name of the vengeful spirit that possesses you.
Reverend Lewis:
Hasn't she suffered enough?
Cotton:
Which is why I seek to end her suffering...
By freeing her from the demon inside.
Reverend Lewis:
Mm.
Cotton: [ Sniffing ]
Reverend Lewis:
Reverend mather?
Cotton: [ Sniffs ]
Agrimony?
Reverend Lewis:
The... apothecary's suggestion.
Cotton:
A herb with no medicinal value.
Used historically in exorcisms.
Reverend Lewis:
Mm.
She wakes.
Cotton:
Mercy?
Can you hear me?
Mercy:
Yes, reverend.
Reverend Lewis:
She looks well.
Cotton:
Eyes clear.
Skin temperate to the touch.
Reverend Lewis:
Bless God.
Mercy: [ Coughing ]
Cotton:
My God.
What is this?
Reverend Lewis:
The barber bled her humors.
She hasn't sufficient time to heal.
[ Music plays, indistinct conversations ]
Mary:
Anne.
What a lovely surprise.
I anticipated only members of the board.
Anne:
Oh, I convinced my father to let me attend.
One can't pass up the rare gathering in Salem that doesn't involve a noose and an angry mob.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Mary:
Mm.
Anne:
A gift from my father.
Mary:
May I?
[ Sizzling ]
Exquisite.
If you'll excuse me...
Mr. Hale:
Ah.
And here I feared the guest of honor wasn't going to make an appearance at his own party.
John:
Well, I flipped a coin.
- Heads...
I stay home.
- Mr. Hale:
And tails?
John:
I flip again and pray for heads.
- No such luck.
- Mr. Hale: [ Chuckles ]
Well, I think you'll find that you have more common ground with your fellow board members than you would have expected.
John:
Oh.
They think Salem's gone mad, too?
Mr. Hale: [ Chuckles ]
Enjoy yourself, huh?
Anne:
Captain Alden.
How nice to see you amongst the lmng...
So to speak.
Mary:
Valerian Root?
You've resorted to the coarse tools of the hunters.
Mr. Hale:
Yes.
Well, sadly,
I can no longer take the safety of my loved ones for granted.
Apparently, there are those in Salem who are not above threatening the lives of children.
Mary:
Hm.
She's no child, magistrate.
Certainly not, judging by the way she lusts for John Alden.
Cotton:
Mrs. Sibley.
I came straightaway with news.
Mercy Lewis is free of her possessor.
Mary:
You're certain?
Cotton:
My exam was thorough.
I could glean no remaining evidence of the demon inside.
Mary:
How serendipitous.
Cotton:
Perhaps beyond good fortune.
This is evidence of the witches' waning strength or waxing fear...
A testament to the potency of our resistance.
Mary:
Forgive me, uh, reverend, as I am but a layman in these matters, but how did she free herself from Satan's grasp?
Cotton:
I detected traces of agrimony, as well as an incision in the girl's abdomen, leading to my supposition that an exorcism had been performed.
Mary:
An exorcism?
A catholic ritual performed in Salem, and you have the audacity to present this as good news?
Do you know what Salem abhors even more than a witch, reverend?
A catholic.
Yet under your most watchful eye, you've now allowed both to flourish.
When could this have happened, reverend...
When you were distracted by drink or by whores?
Cotton:
Mrs. Sibley...
Mary:
Replacing demons with heathens is no victory.
Seems even when you succeed, reverend, you find a way to fail.
Mr. Hale:
We live in a time of war, our enemies hidden among us.
And so there could be no better time than this to welcome a new ally in our fight against the dark forces that threaten our town.
Witches will be no match for a war hero.
The newest member of our board of selectmen...
Captain John Alden.
John:
What if the witches were not the common folk?
Not those who trapped our food nor birthed our babies?
What if the witches were those we've entrusted to lead?
A member, perhaps, of our most esteemed board?
Well, I hope not, 'cause I'm one of you now.
[ Light laughter ]
And, together, I trust we will end the scourge that blights this town.
Gloriana:
Reverend mather.
Cotton:
I'm sorry, Gloriana...
[ Clears throat ] Miss embry...
But it has been a very trying day, and I have not yet begun to prepare tomorrow's sermon.
Gloriana:
I simply wish to thank you...
For showing me the depth of your care yesterday in the public house.
Cotton:
And so you have, miss embry.
Though I assure you that separating you from that unsavory character was a mere act of charity.
Gloriana:
Charity?
Cotton:
So, too, pity.
Gloriana:
Pity and charity?
Cotton:
I'm afraid.
Gloriana:
And it had nothing to do with feeling?
Cotton: [ Scoffs ] Not beyond the feeling I possess for any of God's needy creatures...
A hungry child...
A wounded animal.
Gloriana:
A whore?
Cotton:
Glori...
Miss embry, you know I detest such words.
Gloriana:
But in the house of the lord, there can be no deceit.
Isn't that what you preach?
That a whore is a whore?
Just as one would never say "pity"
when they meant "passion"...
"Charity" when they meant "envy."
Cotton:
Envy?
Gloriana:
At the thought of another man's mouth on mine, his body pressed against mine...
His loins enveloped in mine.
Cotton:
Lord, forgive her impiety.
Gloriana:
Is that the same lord that you invoke from my bed as you thrust in and out of me?
The same lord that you thank as my tongue traces down your chest or up your thigh?
That same lord to which I pray that your promise to return will never be an empty one?
Cotton:
Gloriana, you mustn't be here.
Gloriana:
Or what?
What will you do here...
In the house of the lord?
Cot... cot...
Cotton.
Cotton.
Cot...
Cot... aah.
[ Gasps ] No.
Please.
Gloriana: [ Groans ]
[ Whimpers ]
Cotton: [ Groaning ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
[ Coins clink ]
[ Footsteps departing ]
William:
Mr. Sibley.
My name is Hooke...
William Hooke.
And I have cargo on your frigate detained in port.
Yet your wife refuses to lift the quarantine.
Now, whilst Mrs. Sibley's beauty is beyond dispute, what woman truly grasps the necessities of a man's vocation?
They...
S-sir...
Has your illness rendered you deaf and dumb?
I...
George: [ Groaning ]
[ Grunts ]
Mr. Hale:
I'm a bit upset with myself, captain.
John:
Why?
Mr. Hale:
I invited you to my home under false pretense.
In hoping to gain your trust,
I have clearly done the very opposite.
John:
What's your point, magistrate?
Mr. Hale:
Perhaps it would have been wiser for me to simply tell you the truth about who and what I am.
John:
And what's that?
Mr. Hale:
A concerned father.
Three days ago, my daughter was spelled...
Or so I believe.
John:
And yet when she asked, you...
Mr. Hale:
I lied... yes.
How could I let her know that there are those out there who wish to do her harm?
You see what they've done to the Lewis girl, her mind no longer her own.
What if my Anne is their next target?
You and I have a common enemy...
The witches who would do my Anne and all of us harm.
John:
And who are they?
Mr. Hale:
This remains a mystery.
John:
I must admit, uh...
I underestimated you.
Mr. Hale:
Well, thank you.
John:
You are full of far more...
Than I thought possible.
Maybe you did not spell Anne.
Maybe your explanations have been genuine.
But I don't think so.
I think you're dirty.
And once I find proof, all of Salem will, too.
[ Door opens ]
Tituba:
He requested you, yet shows no signs of agitation.
Mary:
That will change.
Breaking into my home?
Do you know what happens to thieves in Salem?
William:
No.
But I know what happens to witches.
Mary:
What's this?
William:
Perhaps a question best asked of Mr. Sibley.
Mary:
My husband's affliction has robbed him of both reason and sense.
William: [ Chuckles ]
And yet are either actually required to point the finger in Salem?
Mary:
I care not for threats, Mr. Hooke.
William:
And I care not to resort to them.
So, perhaps, we could avoid bringing this note to the attention of the board of selectmen.
Mary:
Grant you access to my ship or face your most scurrilous accusations?
Fine.
At midnight, the ship's sentry will be sent home, and you can retrieve your cargo.
Now out with you.
[ Door closes ]
Tituba:
Does my sense betray me?
He could undo you!
All of us!
Mary:
And so could Mercy.
The familiar has been cut from her.
Tituba:
How?
Mary:
An exorcism...
Performed by her dolt of a father, no doubt.
So we must replace it.
Tituba:
And yet why would she accept it a second time?
Mary:
She wouldn't, unless there is some part of the girl to which we can appeal.
Tituba:
And what part is that?
Mary:
The same part you once touched in me...
The deep, small piece of her that longs for a better life.
Tituba:
You must move quickly, then.
I, alone, will take charge of Mr. Hooke.
Mary:
But, tituba...
These are perilous times.
No blood must lead back to our door.
Do you understand?
Tituba:
Perfectly.
Rose:
Had I known you were a friend of John Alden's,
I would have found another courier.
William:
I can assure you, we are not friends.
If you knew the truth of the man, you would rethink such an accusation.
Rose:
And what truth is that?
William:
In any case, the impediment has been removed.
The package shall be yours by midnight.
Rose:
You did not speak my name to her?
William:
I did as instructed.
But, still, I can't help but wonder... this parcel...
Rose:
You have been paid well not to wonder, Mr. Hooke.
Mary:
Mercy.
Mercy: [ Screams ]
Leave me.
Mary:
I won't leave you.
I can't.
You need me.
Mercy: [ Whimpers ]
[ Crying ] You're a liar.
I don't need you.
Mary:
When you resist me, when you point at a demon that only you can see, what do they do?
They shave your locks.
They weep for your wretched soul.
Mercy:
Go away!
Go!
Mary:
Without me, you are but a girl, weak and ordinary.
But with me inside you, you are...
Omnipotent.
- Mercy: [ Sobbing ]
- Mary:
Hush, now.
Give them no cause to pity you.
Give them only reason to fear you.
Mercy: [ Panting ] No!
No!
Mary:
Open, girl.
Open your mouth.
Yes.
Just like that.
He has chosen you to be his vessel on earth.
There is no greater honor than to be in his service.
Mercy: [ Screaming ]
Reverend Lewis:
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
Mary:
She is mine.
John:
Tituba?
Tituba:
Mary is in trouble.
I am but a servant, captain, unentitled to such an intrusion.
John:
What is it?
Tituba:
I fear you and my mistress share a common adversary...
Mr. Hooke.
John:
How did you know that he...
Tituba:
I saw you quarreling in the Warren off the square.
He demands access to my mistress' ship.
Why?
To retrieve some worthless parcel, as he claims?
Or does he harbor darker intent?
John:
He plans to rob her.
Tituba:
So my mistress fears.
John:
Why did Mrs. Sibley allow him to board that vessel?
Tituba:
He left her no choice.
He threatened to spread false rumor of an affair...
With you, captain.
She sought to reason with him, but...
John:
He is not a man that responds to reason.
Tituba:
Mrs. Sibley would lash me if she knew I had come, but I fear Mr. Hooke will be her ruin.
Unless...
John:
Speak, girl.
Tituba:
Unless there be a man who desires to stop him.
[ Creaking ]
Mr. Hale:
You have feelings for him, don't you?
Anne: "Him"?
Mr. Hale:
Must I say his name?
Was it not obvious to all who were present this evening?
Anne:
Is it not a woman's prerogative to choose which man she fancies?
Mr. Hale:
It is.
Just as it is a father's prerogative to protect his daughter's heart from those he feels will do it harm.
John Alden, for instance.
Anne:
Why do you say this?
Because he doesn't curry your favor, like every other twitchy young man in Salem?
Mr. Hale:
No.
That is not it.
How could he ever be yours truly when he always was and always will be Mary Sibley's?
Anne:
Their history is no secret.
But it is just that... history.
She is a married woman now.
Mr. Hale:
And do you suppose Mary Sibley will idly stand by while you claim that which she rightfully considers to be her own?
Anne:
You fear her, father.
I do not.
Mr. Hale:
You are but a child.
You don't understand.
Anne: [ Chuckling ] A child?
A moment ago, you agreed I was a woman.
Mr. Hale:
It's not for debate.
- Anne:
By whose command?
- Mr. Hale:
By mine!
Your father!
Your lord and master!
I forbid you to have further contact with captain Alden!
Anne:
Or what?
What punishment awaits me?
Will you crush the life from me, as you do your enemies?
Or just my spirit, as you do those you love?
Mr. Hale:
Quiet!
Not one word more!
John:
Put it down.
William:
No.
This parcel belongs to me.
A claim that even Mary Sibley cannot dispute.
John:
I'm not here on her behalf.
Now put it down.
William: [ Chuckles ]
Ask yourself, captain...
Is it really worth it?
John:
What?
William:
The cost of settling old scores.
What would be the charge if the magistrate knew what you did?
Murder?
Treason?
Both?
[ Chuckles ]
John:
You know what happened that day.
William:
Yes.
I watched you spill innocent blood.
Without regret or remorse.
Men slaughtered like animals.
All of them... dead.
John:
Not all of them.
We had a deal, Mr. Hooke...
The day you fell to your knees and begged for your life that should I let you live, we would never cross paths again.
You didn't hold up your end.
William:
Now, think this through, captain.
John:
Oh, I have...
Thoroughly.
And the only life I lament that day was the one I spared.
A man should keep his promises, Mr. Hooke.
William:
So you're... just going to slit my throat here, like some yellow horse?
John:
No.
William:
No.
[ Gasps ]
[ Gasps ]
John: [ Panting ]
John:
Mrs. Sibley.
Mary:
Sleeplessness seems to be epidemic this evening.
John: [ Chuckles ]
Mary:
Do you remember the last time we spoke, in the shadow of the graveyard?
John:
Of course.
Mary:
The promises we made?
You would return within a year.
John:
And you would breathlessly wait.
Were they lies?
Mary:
No.
They were wishes.
Made by those that knew nothing of the world.
John:
And now?
Mary:
We know.
What we desire and what we must do to survive are often at odds.
It's, uh, late, captain.
John:
It is.
Mary:
Long past my bedtime.
John:
I wish you sweet dreams, Mary.
Mary:
Perhaps they've already begun.
Mercy: [ Laughing ]
I know what you are.
[ Laughing ]
Previously on "Salem"...
We all welcome captain Alden home from his long, long service.
You come back for one thing and one thing only.
She's Mary Sibley now.
I waited for you.
Years and years without a word.
I was captured.
If we could forget Salem and its witches.
If we could have a different life.
She can't breathe!
Make it stop.
Please.
My daughter.
We call it a spectral attack...
The work of witches.
Pray for her.
Imperat tibi deus pater...
Imperat tibi deus filius...
Imperat tibi deus spiritus sanctus...
Imperat tibi majestas christi...
You must stop this.
...eternum dei verbum caro factum...
Imperat sacramentum crucis...
They will hang you if they learn of this.
The witches have already taken your life.
I no longer fear the puritans claiming mine.
The wretched spirit that inhabits you must be excised.
Or else what becomes of you?
Hmm?
Madness?
Death?
Do you trust me, Mercy?
Yes, father.
That I would do nothing to hurt you?
Well, of course.
Father.
Father.
I cast you out, every unclean spirit...
Every satanic power...
Please!
I beseech you!
...every onslaught of the infernal adversary...
In the name and in the power of our lord Jesus.
It's you that's been driven to madness!

good morning.
I, uh, am here to collect a parcel incoming on that vessel.
Influenza outbreak.
Five dead.
Frigate's under quarantine.
Quarantine?
By whose order?
George Sibley.
By way of his wife, Mary Sibley.
Does a man desire to know when he is on the precipice of his own death?
What say you, George?
Would your friend, the blacksmith, want to know that scant hours from now,
Mercy Lewis will accuse him of witchcraft?
From which his trial and execution will swiftly follow?
Or would he favor his waning moments be spent in ignorance?
Oh, don't pity him, George.
It is the blood of innocents like your friend that make our grand rite possible.
Each accusation made, each trial convened not for us, but by us.
No one the wiser to our plan and nobody brave enough to stand in our way.
You miss them, don't you?
When I was young,
I thought them horribly sensible people.
Now...
Salem could use more like them.
I'm intruding, captain.
No, no.
I'm glad you're amongst the lmng...
So to speak.
Word was you had taken quite ill.
Indeed.
A fit that came on suddenly and without reason, followed by a restless sleep in which the sickness infected even my dreams.
Your dreams?
I dreamt of a doll with eyes full and black.
And when I awoke, feverish in the night's middle,
I could have sworn the doll was there, staring back at me.
Fever dreams can be quite vmd.
Except I could have sworn that I saw my father enter in darkness and remove the doll.
But when I asked, he laughed and assured me that...
You were dreaming.
Do you doubt my father's veracity, captain Alden?
No.
But it seems like you do.
I...
I have no doubt that he's a good man.
But lately...
What?
Had I but known you were in such safe hands,
I would have spared your mother her worry.
Magistrate.
Come along, Anne.
Let us allow captain Alden his privacy.
Have I heard you correctly?
Are you suggesting that Anne Hale is the victim of...
A spell.
Am I, too, the victim of a spell?
Or has John Alden finally declared his belief in witches?
I've seen too much to deny any longer, making my next step obvious...
Catching one.
As you know, apprehending a witch is no easy feat.
Unless you know who they are.
Have you uncovered the conjurer who spelled Anne?
Who is it?
Tell me.
Someone in proximity to his victim.
Yes.
Whose own daughter voices her suspicions.
Magistrate Hale?
He's not who he seems.
Who amongst us is?
You?
Or I?
Who among us is unburdened by shame or secrets that we hide from the world?
I'm reverend mather.
Is there a problem?
Well, no.
The lady and I were just discussing some business.
- Business?
- Yes.
As in how much it might cost me to get down to some.
This is a reputable establishment!
It offers no place for your lechery.
- Reverend.
- Reverend.
Cotton!
Pardon me.
I apologize if I've caused any offense.
Good day.
Do you know that man?
Never seen him before.
♪ Ring around the rosies
♪ pocketful of posies
♪ ashes, ashes
♪ we all fall down
ah.
Yeah.
She has arrived.
Mercy.
My dear, this is a blessing.
Truly.
And she is again well enough to breathe the fall air.
Our deepest gratitude is often saved for what we once took for granted.
Mercy?
- What is it?
- No.
No, my child.
No.
No.
The witch!
Who's the witch, Mercy?
!
Tell us!
Who's the witch?
!
Is he the witch, Mercy?
Is he?
!
Mercy!
Mercy!
Help!
Will someone help us?
!
What's happened?
We've lost control.
She is no longer ours.
The hive is restless.
Some are beginning to doubt your grand vision for our kind.
Who?
Give me their names.
You're missing the point, child.
Then perhaps he should make one.
Trials are preceded by accusations.
And accusations are predicated upon your control of the girl.
The hunter's moon fast approaches.
Yet the blacksmith still blithely peddles his wares, his blood lost to our cause.
How dare you.
Before Mary, we were not feared, but fearful, not hunters, but prey.
And yet does her strength and vision garner your praise?
No.
Only your doubt.
The girl has been rendered frail by her circumstance.
Nothing more.
My mastery is not of issue.
This is an assurance?
She needs but a moment of rest.
After which, she will again be strong enough to point the finger.
Yet another issue remains...
That of John Alden.
What of him?
His suspicion of me is palpable.
If she cannot abate his threat, then I will be forced to do so myself... as I see fit.
Should you desire John Alden's trust,
I would suggest you find a way to earn it.
And, Mary...
Your vision guides us.
I will report to the others that your plan shall resume anon.
We need answers quickly.
And we will get them.
How?
The quickest way one finds answers...
Blame.
Is it your intent to rob me of my remaining faith in you, reverend?
Mrs. Sibley.
I didn't hear you arrive.
Your charge, simple and clear, is to protect the Lewis girl from further possession.
And yet... was the episode in the marketplace not evidence of exactly that?
We have no proof it was the work of witches.
So you've paid her a visit, then?
You've determined what ails her?
The pastor says she's resting and best not be disturbed.
May I ask you a question, reverend?
When your father seeks out demons, does he ask permission?
Does he knock on doors and offer to come back at a more convenient time?
Or does he, armed with the lord's righteousness, demand the demon answer to him?
My father and I are different men.
We work in different ways.
When I summoned a hunter of witches to protect the people of Salem, it was not you I requested.
Yet it was you who arrived on our shores.
Do not make me regret settling for my second choice.
Captain Alden.
How fortuitous.
I was just about to set this on your doorstep.
I'll spare you the mystery.
It's a reception tomorrow evening in your honor.
A reception?
No.
That's not necessary.
But it is.
You're a selectman now.
And, on a more personal note, a chance to make amends for my less-than-hospitable behavior since your return.
Can we trust you'll be in attendance?
Excuse me, magistrate.
Lieutenant Hooke.
John Alden.
Now, is this any way to greet the man who saved you from those savages?
What the hell are you doing here?
Business, captain.
There is a vessel in port on which I have cargo.
And until the quarantine is lifted,
I am marooned here in your little witch town.
We had a deal, and it was a simple one...
That I was never to set eyes on you again.
Yes.
Well, you needn't worry.
We're not the same men we were in the war.
But...
There is something you could do to hasten my departure.
What is that?
The girl you spoke of in battle...
Mary Wolcott.
Although she's Mary Sibley now, isn't she?
An introduction with her would certain...
You stay away from Mary.
Or what, John?
What will you do?
What I should have done last time.
Now, careful, captain.
Before a man makes threats, he should take stock of what he risks...
Unless you do not mind me telling the good people of Salem just who John Alden really is...
Neither the man nor the war hero he purports to be.
I want you to finish your business with all due haste, and then by coach or by steed or by ship, I want you gone.
You have my word.
Mr. Sibley's feeding will have to wait until I return from the reception.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Sibley.
And you are?
I'm Hooke...
William Hooke.
Forgive my boldness, but I wondered if I might speak to you of your ship detained in port.
As you've doubtless heard, it's under quarantine.
Well, 'tis no bother.
I merely mean to board the vessel and retrieve my cargo.
And risk infection?
Or worse?
Well, this must be very valuable cargo, Mr. Hooke.
Sorry.
No one's permitted on board.
Well, perhaps Mr. Sibley will be more open to reason.
I can assure you, Mr. Hooke, my husband and I are of one mind on all matters.
Good evening.
Mercy, if you can hear me, I beseech you, speak to me the name of the vengeful spirit that possesses you.
Hasn't she suffered enough?
Which is why I seek to end her suffering...
By freeing her from the demon inside.
Mm.
Reverend mather?
Agrimony?
The... apothecary's suggestion.
A herb with no medicinal value.
Used historically in exorcisms.
Mm.
She wakes.
Mercy?
Can you hear me?
Yes, reverend.
She looks well.
Eyes clear.
Skin temperate to the touch.
Bless God.
My God.
What is this?
The barber bled her humors.
She hasn't sufficient time to heal.
Anne.
What a lovely surprise.
I anticipated only members of the board.
Oh, I convinced my father to let me attend.
One can't pass up the rare gathering in Salem that doesn't involve a noose and an angry mob.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Mm.
A gift from my father.
May I?
Exquisite.
If you'll excuse me...
Ah.
And here I feared the guest of honor wasn't going to make an appearance at his own party.
Well, I flipped a coin.
- Heads...
I stay home.
- And tails?
I flip again and pray for heads.
No such luck.
Well, I think you'll find that you have more common ground with your fellow board members than you would have expected.
Oh.
They think Salem's gone mad, too?
Enjoy yourself, huh?
Captain Alden.
How nice to see you amongst the lmng...
So to speak.
Valerian Root?
You've resorted to the coarse tools of the hunters.
Yes.
Well, sadly,
I can no longer take the safety of my loved ones for granted.
Apparently, there are those in Salem who are not above threatening the lives of children.
Hm.
She's no child, magistrate.
Certainly not, judging by the way she lusts for John Alden.
Mrs. Sibley.
I came straightaway with news.
Mercy Lewis is free of her possessor.
You're certain?
My exam was thorough.
I could glean no remaining evidence of the demon inside.
How serendipitous.
Perhaps beyond good fortune.
This is evidence of the witches' waning strength or waxing fear...
A testament to the potency of our resistance.
Forgive me, uh, reverend, as I am but a layman in these matters, but how did she free herself from Satan's grasp?
I detected traces of agrimony, as well as an incision in the girl's abdomen, leading to my supposition that an exorcism had been performed.
An exorcism?
A catholic ritual performed in Salem, and you have the audacity to present this as good news?
Do you know what Salem abhors even more than a witch, reverend?
A catholic.
Yet under your most watchful eye, you've now allowed both to flourish.
When could this have happened, reverend...
When you were distracted by drink or by whores?
Mrs. Sibley...
Replacing demons with heathens is no victory.
Seems even when you succeed, reverend, you find a way to fail.
We live in a time of war, our enemies hidden among us.
And so there could be no better time than this to welcome a new ally in our fight against the dark forces that threaten our town.
Witches will be no match for a war hero.
The newest member of our board of selectmen...
Captain John Alden.
What if the witches were not the common folk?
Not those who trapped our food nor birthed our babies?
What if the witches were those we've entrusted to lead?
A member, perhaps, of our most esteemed board?
Well, I hope not, 'cause I'm one of you now.
And, together, I trust we will end the scourge that blights this town.
Reverend mather.
I'm sorry, Gloriana...
Miss embry...
But it has been a very trying day, and I have not yet begun to prepare tomorrow's sermon.
I simply wish to thank you...
For showing me the depth of your care yesterday in the public house.
And so you have, miss embry.
Though I assure you that separating you from that unsavory character was a mere act of charity.
Charity?
So, too, pity.
Pity and charity?
I'm afraid.
And it had nothing to do with feeling?
Not beyond the feeling I possess for any of God's needy creatures...
A hungry child...
A wounded animal.
A whore?
Glori...
Miss embry, you know I detest such words.
But in the house of the lord, there can be no deceit.
Isn't that what you preach?
That a whore is a whore?
Just as one would never say "pity"
when they meant "passion"...
"Charity" when they meant "envy."
Envy?
At the thought of another man's mouth on mine, his body pressed against mine...
His loins enveloped in mine.
Lord, forgive her impiety.
Is that the same lord that you invoke from my bed as you thrust in and out of me?
The same lord that you thank as my tongue traces down your chest or up your thigh?
That same lord to which I pray that your promise to return will never be an empty one?
Gloriana, you mustn't be here.
Or what?
What will you do here...
In the house of the lord?
Cot... cot...
Cotton.
Cotton.
Cot...
Cot... aah.
No.
Please.
Mr. Sibley.
My name is Hooke...
William Hooke.
And I have cargo on your frigate detained in port.
Yet your wife refuses to lift the quarantine.
Now, whilst Mrs. Sibley's beauty is beyond dispute, what woman truly grasps the necessities of a man's vocation?
They...
S-sir...
Has your illness rendered you deaf and dumb?
I...
I'm a bit upset with myself, captain.
Why?
I invited you to my home under false pretense.
In hoping to gain your trust,
I have clearly done the very opposite.
What's your point, magistrate?
Perhaps it would have been wiser for me to simply tell you the truth about who and what I am.
And what's that?
A concerned father.
Three days ago, my daughter was spelled...
Or so I believe.
And yet when she asked, you...
I lied... yes.
How could I let her know that there are those out there who wish to do her harm?
You see what they've done to the Lewis girl, her mind no longer her own.
What if my Anne is their next target?
You and I have a common enemy...
The witches who would do my Anne and all of us harm.
And who are they?
This remains a mystery.
I must admit, uh...
I underestimated you.
Well, thank you.
You are full of far more...
Than I thought possible.
Maybe you did not spell Anne.
Maybe your explanations have been genuine.
But I don't think so.
I think you're dirty.
And once I find proof, all of Salem will, too.
He requested you, yet shows no signs of agitation.
That will change.
Breaking into my home?
Do you know what happens to thieves in Salem?
No.
But I know what happens to witches.
What's this?
Perhaps a question best asked of Mr. Sibley.
My husband's affliction has robbed him of both reason and sense.
And yet are either actually required to point the finger in Salem?
I care not for threats, Mr. Hooke.
And I care not to resort to them.
So, perhaps, we could avoid bringing this note to the attention of the board of selectmen.
Grant you access to my ship or face your most scurrilous accusations?
Fine.
At midnight, the ship's sentry will be sent home, and you can retrieve your cargo.
Now out with you.
Does my sense betray me?
He could undo you!
All of us!
And so could Mercy.
The familiar has been cut from her.
How?
An exorcism...
Performed by her dolt of a father, no doubt.
So we must replace it.
And yet why would she accept it a second time?
She wouldn't, unless there is some part of the girl to which we can appeal.
And what part is that?
The same part you once touched in me...
The deep, small piece of her that longs for a better life.
You must move quickly, then.
I, alone, will take charge of Mr. Hooke.
But, tituba...
These are perilous times.
No blood must lead back to our door.
Do you understand?
Perfectly.
Had I known you were a friend of John Alden's,
I would have found another courier.
I can assure you, we are not friends.
If you knew the truth of the man, you would rethink such an accusation.
And what truth is that?
In any case, the impediment has been removed.
The package shall be yours by midnight.
You did not speak my name to her?
I did as instructed.
But, still, I can't help but wonder... this parcel...
You have been paid well not to wonder, Mr. Hooke.
Mercy.
Leave me.
I won't leave you.
I can't.
You need me.
You're a liar.
I don't need you.
When you resist me, when you point at a demon that only you can see, what do they do?
They shave your locks.
They weep for your wretched soul.
Go away!
Go!
Without me, you are but a girl, weak and ordinary.
But with me inside you, you are...
Omnipotent.
Hush, now.
Give them no cause to pity you.
Give them only reason to fear you.
No!
No!
Open, girl.
Open your mouth.
Yes.
Just like that.
He has chosen you to be his vessel on earth.
There is no greater honor than to be in his service.
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
She is mine.
Tituba?
Mary is in trouble.
I am but a servant, captain, unentitled to such an intrusion.
What is it?
I fear you and my mistress share a common adversary...
Mr. Hooke.
How did you know that he...
I saw you quarreling in the Warren off the square.
He demands access to my mistress' ship.
Why?
To retrieve some worthless parcel, as he claims?
Or does he harbor darker intent?
He plans to rob her.
So my mistress fears.
Why did Mrs. Sibley allow him to board that vessel?
He left her no choice.
He threatened to spread false rumor of an affair...
With you, captain.
She sought to reason with him, but...
He is not a man that responds to reason.
Mrs. Sibley would lash me if she knew I had come, but I fear Mr. Hooke will be her ruin.
Unless...
Speak, girl.
Unless there be a man who desires to stop him.
You have feelings for him, don't you?
"Him"?
Must I say his name?
Was it not obvious to all who were present this evening?
Is it not a woman's prerogative to choose which man she fancies?
It is.
Just as it is a father's prerogative to protect his daughter's heart from those he feels will do it harm.
John Alden, for instance.
Why do you say this?
Because he doesn't curry your favor, like every other twitchy young man in Salem?
No.
That is not it.
How could he ever be yours truly when he always was and always will be Mary Sibley's?
Their history is no secret.
But it is just that... history.
She is a married woman now.
And do you suppose Mary Sibley will idly stand by while you claim that which she rightfully considers to be her own?
You fear her, father.
I do not.
You are but a child.
You don't understand.
A child?
A moment ago, you agreed I was a woman.
It's not for debate.
- By whose command?
- By mine!
Your father!
Your lord and master!
I forbid you to have further contact with captain Alden!
Or what?
What punishment awaits me?
Will you crush the life from me, as you do your enemies?
Or just my spirit, as you do those you love?
Quiet!
Not one word more!
Put it down.
No.
This parcel belongs to me.
A claim that even Mary Sibley cannot dispute.
I'm not here on her behalf.
Now put it down.
Ask yourself, captain...
Is it really worth it?
What?
The cost of settling old scores.
What would be the charge if the magistrate knew what you did?
Murder?
Treason?
Both?
You know what happened that day.
Yes.
I watched you spill innocent blood.
Without regret or remorse.
Men slaughtered like animals.
All of them... dead.
Not all of them.
We had a deal, Mr. Hooke...
The day you fell to your knees and begged for your life that should I let you live, we would never cross paths again.
You didn't hold up your end.
Now, think this through, captain.
Oh, I have...
Thoroughly.
And the only life I lament that day was the one I spared.
A man should keep his promises, Mr. Hooke.
So you're... just going to slit my throat here, like some yellow horse?
No.
No.
Mrs. Sibley.
Sleeplessness seems to be epidemic this evening.
Do you remember the last time we spoke, in the shadow of the graveyard?
Of course.
The promises we made?
You would return within a year.
And you would breathlessly wait.
Were they lies?
No.
They were wishes.
Made by those that knew nothing of the world.
And now?
We know.
What we desire and what we must do to survive are often at odds.
It's, uh, late, captain.
It is.
Long past my bedtime.
I wish you sweet dreams, Mary.
Perhaps they've already begun.
I know what you are.
Previously on "Salem"...
Mary:
We all welcome Captain Alden home from his long, long service.
Giles:
You come back for one thing and one thing only.
She's Mary Sibley now.
Mary:
I waited for you.
Years and years without a word.
John:
I was captured.
Gloriana:
If we could forget Salem and its witches.
If we could have a different life.
Mrs. Hale:
She can't breathe!
Mr. Hale:
Make it stop.
Please.
My daughter.
Cotton:
We call it a spectral attack... the work of witches.
Pray for her.

Reverend Lewis:
The witches have already taken your life.
I no longer fear the puritans claiming mine.
The wretched spirit that inhabits you must be excised.
Or else what becomes of you?
Hmm?
Madness?
Death?
Do you trust me, Mercy?
Mercy:
Yes, father.
Reverend Lewis:
That I would do nothing to hurt you?
Mercy:
Well, of course.
Reverend Lewis: [Smooches]
Mercy: [Breathing shakily]
Father.
Father.
Reverend Lewis:
I cast you out, every unclean spirit...
Every satanic power...
Mercy:
Please!
I beseech you!
Reverend Lewis: ...
Every onslaught of the infernal adversary...
In the name and in the power of our Lord Jesus.
Mercy:
It's you that's been driven to madness!

Good morning.
I, uh, am here to collect a parcel incoming on that vessel.
Sentry:
Influenza outbreak.
Five dead.
Frigate's under quarantine.
William:
Quarantine?
By whose order?
Sentry:
George Sibley.
By way of his wife, Mary Sibley.
Mary:
Does a man desire to know when he is on the precipice of his own death?
What say you, George?
Would your friend, the blacksmith, want to know that scant hours from now,
Mercy Lewis will accuse him of witchcraft?
From which his trial and execution will swiftly follow?
Or would he favor his waning moments be spent in ignorance?
Oh, don't pity him, George.
It is the blood of innocents like your friend that make our grand rite possible.
Each accusation made, each trial convened not for us, but by us.
No one the wiser to our plan and nobody brave enough to stand in our way.

No, no.
I'm glad you're amongst the living... so to speak.

Anne:
Except I could have sworn that I saw my father enter in darkness and remove the doll.
But when I asked, he laughed and assured me that...
John:
You were dreaming.
Anne:
Do you doubt my father's veracity, Captain Alden?
John:
No.
But it seems like you do.
Anne:

I have no doubt that he's a good man.

Yet the blacksmith still blithely peddles his wares, his blood lost to our cause.
Tituba:
How dare you.
Before Mary, we were not feared, but fearful, not hunters, but prey.
And yet does her strength and vision garner your praise?
No.
Only your doubt.
Mary:
The girl has been rendered frail by her circumstance.
Nothing more.
My mastery is not of issue.
Rose:
This is an assurance?
Mary:
She needs but a moment of rest.
After which, she will again be strong enough to point the finger.
Mr. Hale:
Yet another issue remains... that of John Alden.
Mary:
What of him?
Mr. Hale:
His suspicion of me is palpable.
If she cannot abate his threat, then I will be forced to do so myself... as I see fit.
Rose:
Should you desire John Alden's trust,
I would suggest you find a way to earn it.
And, Mary...
Your vision guides us.
I will report to the others that your plan shall resume anon.
Tituba:
We need answers quickly.
Mary:
And we will get them.
Tituba:

Your charge, simple and clear, is to protect the Lewis girl from further possession.
And yet...
Was the episode in the marketplace not evidence of exactly that?
Cotton:
We have no proof it was the work of witches.
Mary:
So you've paid her a visit, then?
You've determined what ails her?
Cotton:
The pastor says she's resting and best not be disturbed.
Mary:
May I ask you a question, Reverend?
When your father seeks out demons, does he ask permission?
Does he knock on doors and offer to come back at a more convenient time?
Or does he, armed with the lord's righteousness, demand the demon answer to him?
Cotton:
My father and I are different men.
We work in different ways.
Mary:
When I summoned a hunter of witches to protect the people of Salem, it was not you I requested.
Yet it was you who arrived on our shores.
Do not make me regret settling for my second choice.
Mr. Hale:
Captain Alden.
How fortuitous.
I was just about to set this on your doorstep.
I'll spare you the mystery.
It's a reception tomorrow evening in your honor.
John:
A reception?
No.
That's not necessary.
Mr. Hale:
But it is.
You're a selectman now.
And, on a more personal note, a chance to make amends for my less-than-hospitable behavior since your return.
Can we trust you'll be in attendance?
John:
Excuse me, magistrate.
Lieutenant Hooke.
William:
John Alden.
Now, is this any way to greet the man who saved you from those savages?
John:
What the hell are you doing here?
William:
Business, Captain.
There is a vessel in port on which I have cargo.
And until the quarantine is lifted,
I am marooned here in your little witch town.
John:
We had a deal, and it was a simple one... that I was never to set eyes on you again.
William:
Yes.
Well, you needn't worry.
We're not the same men we were in the war.
But...
There is something you could do to hasten my departure.
John:
What is that?
William:
The girl you spoke of in battle...
Mary Weverend.
Although she's Mary Sibley now, isn't she?
An introduction with her would certain...
John:
You stay away from Mary.
William:
Or what, John?
What will you do?
John:
What I should have done last time.
William: [Scoffs]
Now, careful, Captain.
Before a man makes threats, he should take stock of what he risks... unless you do not mind me telling the good people of Salem just who John Alden really is... neither the man nor the war hero he purports to be.
John:
I want you to finish your business with all due haste, and then by coach or by steed or by ship, I want you gone.
You have my word.
Mary:
Mr. Sibley's feeding will have to wait until I return from the reception.
George: [Groans]
[Groaning]
William:
Excuse me.
Mrs. Sibley.
Mary:
And you are?
William:
I'm Hooke...
William Hooke.
Forgive my boldness, but I wondered if I might speak to you of your ship detained in port.
Mary:
As you've doubtless heard, it's under quarantine.
William:
Well, 'tis no bother.
I merely mean to board the vessel and retrieve my cargo.
Mary:
And risk infection?
Or worse?
Well, this must be very valuable cargo, Mr. Hooke.
Sorry.
No one's permitted on board.
William:
Well, perhaps Mr. Sibley will be more open to reason.
Mary:
I can assure you, Mr. Hooke, my husband and I are of one mind on all matters.
Good evening.
Cotton:
Mercy, if you can hear me, I beseech you, speak to me the name of the vengeful spirit that possesses you.
Reverend Lewis:
Hasn't she suffered enough?
Cotton:
Which is why I seek to end her suffering... by freeing her from the demon inside.
Reverend Lewis:
Mm.
Cotton: [Sniffing]
Reverend Lewis:
Reverend Mather?
Cotton: [Sniffs]
Agrimony?
Reverend Lewis:
The...
Apothecary's suggestion.
Cotton:
A herb with no medicinal value.
Used historically in exorcisms.
Reverend Lewis:
Mm.
She wakes.
Cotton:
Mercy?
Can you hear me?
Mercy:
Yes, Reverend.
Reverend Lewis:
She looks well.
Cotton:
Eyes clear.
Skin temperate to the touch.
Reverend Lewis:
Bless God.
Mercy: [Coughing]
Cotton:
My God.
What is this?
Reverend Lewis:
The barber bled her humors.
She hasn't sufficient time to heal.
[Music plays, indistinct conversations]
Mary:
Anne.
What a lovely surprise.
I anticipated only members of the board.
Anne:
Oh, I convinced my father to let me attend.
One can't pass up the rare gathering in Salem that doesn't involve a noose and an angry mob.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Mary:
Mm.
Anne:
A gift from my father.
Mary:
May I?
[Sizzling]
Exquisite.
If you'll excuse me...
Mr. Hale:
Ah.
And here I feared the guest of honor wasn't going to make an appearance at his own party.
John:
Well, I flipped a coin.
- Heads...
I stay home.
- Mr. Hale:
And tails?
John:
I flip again and pray for heads.
- No such luck.
- Mr. Hale: [Chuckles]
Well, I think you'll find that you have more common ground with your fellow board members than you would have expected.
John:
Oh.
They think Salem's gone mad, too?
Mr. Hale: [Chuckles]
Enjoy yourself, huh?
Anne:
Captain Alden.
How nice to see you amongst the living... so to speak.
Mary:
Valerian root?
You've resorted to the coarse tools of the hunters.
Mr. Hale:
Yes.
Well, sadly,
I can no longer take the safety of my loved ones for granted.
Apparently, there are those in Salem who are not above threatening the lives of children.
Mary:
Hm.
She's no child, magistrate.
Certainly not, judging by the way she lusts for John Alden.
Cotton:
Mrs. Sibley.
I came straightaway with news.
Mercy Lewis is free of her possessor.
Mary:
You're certain?
Cotton:
My exam was thorough.
I could glean no remaining evidence of the demon inside.
Mary:
How serendipitous.
Cotton:
Perhaps beyond good fortune.
This is evidence of the witches' waning strength or waxing fear... a testament to the potency of our resistance.
Mary:
Forgive me, uh, Reverend, as I am but a layman in these matters, but how did she free herself from Satan's grasp?
Cotton:
I detected traces of agrimony, as well as an incision in the girl's abdomen, leading to my supposition that an exorcism had been performed.
Mary:
An exorcism?
A catholic ritual performed in Salem, and you have the audacity to present this as good news?
Do you know what Salem abhors even more than a witch, Reverend?
A catholic.
Yet under your most watchful eye, you've now allowed both to flourish.
When could this have happened, Reverend... when you were distracted by drink or by whores?
Cotton:
Mrs. Sibley...
Mary:
Replacing demons with heathens is no victory.
Seems even when you succeed, Reverend, you find a way to fail.
Mr. Hale:
We live in a time of war, our enemies hidden among us.
And so there could be no better time than this to welcome a new ally in our fight against the dark forces that threaten our town.
Witches will be no match for a war hero.
The newest member of our board of selectmen...
Captain John Alden.
John:
What if the witches were not the common folk?
Not those who trapped our food nor birthed our babies?
What if the witches were those we've entrusted to lead?
A member, perhaps, of our most esteemed board?
Well, I hope not, 'cause I'm one of you now.
[Light laughter]
And, together, I trust we will end the scourge that blights this town.
Gloriana:
Reverend Mather.
Cotton:
I'm sorry, Gloriana... [clears throat] Miss Embry... but it has been a very trying day, and I have not yet begun to prepare tomorrow's sermon.
Gloriana:
I simply wish to thank you... for showing me the depth of your care yesterday in the public house.
Cotton:
And so you have, Miss Embry.
Though I assure you that separating you from that unsavory character was a mere act of charity.
Gloriana:
Charity?
Cotton:
So, too, pity.
Gloriana:
Pity and charity?
Cotton:
I'm afraid.
Gloriana:
And it had nothing to do with feeling?
Cotton: [Scoffs] Not beyond the feeling I possess for any of God's needy creatures... a hungry child...
A wounded animal.
Gloriana:
A whore?
Cotton:
Glori...
Miss Embry, you know I detest such words.
Gloriana:
But in the house of the lord, there can be no deceit.
Isn't that what you preach?
That a whore is a whore?
Just as one would never say "pity"
when they meant "passion"...
"Charity" when they meant "envy."
Cotton:
Envy?
Gloriana:
At the thought of another man's mouth on mine, his body pressed against mine...
His loins enveloped in mine.
Cotton:
Lord, forgive her impiety.
Gloriana:
Is that the same lord that you invoke from my bed as you thrust in and out of me?
The same lord that you thank as my tongue traces down your chest or up your thigh?
That same lord to which I pray that your promise to return will never be an empty one?
Cotton:
Gloriana, you mustn't be here.
Gloriana:
Or what?
What will you do here...
in the house of the lord?
Cot... cot...
Cotton.
Cotton.
Cot... cot... aah.
[Gasps] No.
Please.
Gloriana: [Groans]
[Whimpers]
Cotton: [Groaning]
[Breathing heavily]
[Coins clink]
[Footsteps departing]
William:
Mr. Sibley.
My name is Hooke...
William Hooke.
And I have cargo on your frigate detained in port.
Yet your wife refuses to lift the quarantine.
Now, whilst Mrs. Sibley's beauty is beyond dispute, what woman truly grasps the necessities of a man's vocation?
They...
S-sir...
Has your illness rendered you deaf and dumb?
I...
George: [Groaning]
[Grunts]
Mr. Hale:
I'm a bit upset with myself, Captain.
John:
Why?
Mr. Hale:
I invited you to my home under false pretense.
In hoping to gain your trust,
I have clearly done the very opposite.
John:
What's your point, magistrate?
Mr. Hale:
Perhaps it would have been wiser for me to simply tell you the truth about who and what I am.
John:
And what's that?
Mr. Hale:
A concerned father.
Three days ago, my daughter was spelled... or so I believe.
John:
And yet when she asked, you...
Mr. Hale:
I lied... yes.
How could I let her know that there are those out there who wish to do her harm?
You see what they've done to the Lewis girl, her mind no longer her own.
What if my Anne is their next target?
You and I have a common enemy... the witches who would do my Anne and all of us harm.
John:
And who are they?
Mr. Hale:
This remains a mystery.
John:
I must admit, uh...
I underestimated you.
Mr. Hale:
Well, thank you.
John:
You are full of far more [Bleep] than I thought possible.
Maybe you did not spell Anne.
Maybe your explanations have been genuine.
But I don't think so.
I think you're dirty.
And once I find proof, all of Salem will, too.
[Door opens]
Tituba:
He requested you, yet shows no signs of agitation.
Mary:
That will change.
Breaking into my home?
Do you know what happens to thieves in Salem?
William:
No.
But I know what happens to witches.
Mary:
What's this?
William:
Perhaps a question best asked of Mr. Sibley.
Mary:
My husband's affliction has robbed him of both reason and sense.
William: [Chuckles]
And yet are either actually required to point the finger in Salem?
Mary:
I care not for threats, Mr. Hooke.
William:
And I care not to resort to them.
So, perhaps, we could avoid bringing this note to the attention of the board of selectmen.
Mary:
Grant you access to my ship or face your most scurrilous accusations?
Fine.
At midnight, the ship's sentry will be sent home, and you can retrieve your cargo.
Now out with you.
[Door closes]
Tituba:
Does my sense betray me?
He could undo you!
All of us!
Mary:
And so could Mercy.
The familiar has been cut from her.
Tituba:
How?
Mary:
An exorcism... performed by her dolt of a father, no doubt.
So we must replace it.
Tituba:
And yet why would she accept it a second time?
Mary:
She wouldn't, unless there is some part of the girl to which we can appeal.
Tituba:
And what part is that?
Mary:
The same part you once touched in me... the deep, small piece of her that longs for a better life.
Tituba:
You must move quickly, then.
I, alone, will take charge of Mr. Hooke.
Mary:
But, Tituba...
These are perilous times.
No blood must lead back to our door.
Do you understand?
Tituba:
Perfectly.
Rose:
Had I known you were a friend of John Alden's,
I would have found another courier.
William:
I can assure you, we are not friends.
If you knew the truth of the man, you would rethink such an accusation.
Rose:
And what truth is that?
William:
In any case, the impediment has been removed.
The package shall be yours by midnight.
Rose:
You did not speak my name to her?
William:
I did as instructed.
But, still, I can't help but wonder... this parcel...
Rose:
You have been paid well not to wonder, Mr. Hooke.
Mary:
Mercy.
Mercy: [Screams]
Leave me.
Mary:
I won't leave you.
I can't.
You need me.
Mercy: [Whimpers]
[Crying] You're a liar.
I don't need you.
Mary:
When you resist me, when you point at a demon that only you can see, what do they do?
They shave your locks.
They weep for your wretched soul.
Mercy:
Go away!
Go!
Mary:
Without me, you are but a girl, weak and ordinary.
But with me inside you, you are...
Omnipotent.
- Mercy: [Sobbing]
- Mary:
Hush, now.
Give them no cause to pity you.
Give them only reason to fear you.
Mercy: [Panting] No!
No!
Mary:
Open, girl.
Open your mouth.
Yes.
Just like that.
He has chosen you to be his vessel on earth.
There is no greater honor than to be in his service.
Mercy: [Screaming]
Reverend Lewis:
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
Mary:
She is mine.
John:
Tituba?
Tituba:
Mary is in trouble.
I am but a servant, Captain, unentitled to such an intrusion.
John:
What is it?
Tituba:
I fear you and my mistress share a common adversary...
Mr. Hooke.
John:
How did you know that he...
Tituba:
I saw you quarreling in the Warren off the square.
He demands access to my mistress' ship.
Why?
To retrieve some worthless parcel, as he claims?
Or does he harbor darker intent?
John:
He plans to rob her.
Tituba:
So my mistress fears.
John:
Why did Mrs. Sibley allow him to board that vessel?
Tituba:
He left her no choice.
He threatened to spread false rumor of an affair... with you, Captain.
She sought to reason with him, but...
John:
He is not a man that responds to reason.
Tituba:
Mrs. Sibley would lash me if she knew I had come, but I fear Mr. Hooke will be her ruin.
Unless...
John:
Speak, girl.
Tituba:
Unless there be a man who desires to stop him.
[Creaking]
Mr. Hale:
You have feelings for him, don't you?
Anne: "Him"?
Mr. Hale:
Must I say his name?
Was it not obvious to all who were present this evening?
Anne:
Is it not a woman's prerogative to choose which man she fancies?
Mr. Hale:
It is.
Just as it is a father's prerogative to protect his daughter's heart from those he feels will do it harm.
John Alden, for instance.
Anne:
Why do you say this?
Because he doesn't curry your favor, like every other twitchy young man in Salem?
Mr. Hale:
No.
That is not it.
How could he ever be yours truly when he always was and always will be Mary Sibley's?
Anne:
Their history is no secret.
But it is just that... history.
She is a married woman now.
Mr. Hale:
And do you suppose Mary Sibley will idly stand by while you claim that which she rightfully considers to be her own?
Anne:
You fear her, father.
I do not.
Mr. Hale:
You are but a child.
You don't understand.
Anne: [Chuckling] A child?
A moment ago, you agreed I was a woman.
Mr. Hale:
It's not for debate.
- Anne:
By whose command?
- Mr. Hale:
By mine!
Your father!
Your lord and master!
I forbid you to have further contact with Captain Alden!
Anne:
Or what?
What punishment awaits me?
Will you crush the life from me, as you do your enemies?
Or just my spirit, as you do those you love?
Mr. Hale:
Quiet!
Not one word more!
John:
Put it down.
William:
No.
This parcel belongs to me.
A claim that even Mary Sibley cannot dispute.
John:
I'm not here on her behalf.
Now put it down.
William: [Chuckles]
Ask yourself, Captain...
Is it really worth it?
John:
What?
William:
The cost of settling old scores.
What would be the charge if the magistrate knew what you did?
Murder?
Treason?
Both?
[Chuckles]
John:
You know what happened that day.
William:
Yes.
I watched you spill innocent blood.
Without regret or remorse.
Men slaughtered like animals.
All of them... dead.
John:
Not all of them.
We had a deal, Mr. Hooke... the day you fell to your knees and begged for your life that should I let you live, we would never cross paths again.
You didn't hold up your end.
William:
Now, think this through, Captain.
John:
Oh, I have... thoroughly.
And the only life I lament that day was the one I spared.
A man should keep his promises, Mr. Hooke.
William:
So you're...
Just going to slit my throat here, like some yellow horse?
John:
No.
William:
No.
[Gasps]
[Gasps]
John: [Panting]
John:
Mrs. Sibley.
Mary:
Sleeplessness seems to be epidemic this evening.
John: [Chuckles]
Mary:
Do you remember the last time we spoke, in the shadow of the graveyard?
John:
Of course.
Mary:
The promises we made?
You would return within a year.
John:
And you would breathlessly wait.
Were they lies?
Mary:
No.
They were wishes.
Made by those that knew nothing of the world.
John:
And now?
Mary:
We know.
What we desire and what we must do to survive are often at odds.
It's, uh, late, Captain.
John:
It is.
Mary:
Long past my bedtime.
John:
I wish you sweet dreams, Mary.
Mary:
Perhaps they've already begun.
Mercy: [Laughing]
I know what you are.
[Laughing]
- You sure the controller's not busted?
- You wish.
- Hey, don't hate on her 'cause she's whupping you, burgess.
- Seriously, these buttons are stuck.
- Seriously, you're not good.
- [scoffs] [phone beeps]
- Hey, vinessa, finish that homework, huh?
One second.
- So why don't you guys work together anymore?
- What's up?
- Um...
Uh, because your brother's in intelligence now.
He's a big shot.
- Oh, why aren't you?
- Right.
Okay.
Be right there.
- That's a good question.
- Yo, burgess, something just popped off.
Will you, uh...
- Yeah, yeah, no worries.
I got her.
- Hey, vinessa, be good, girl.
[door closes]
- Hey, it's okay.
He'll be back soon.
All right, let's do this.
Oh, no.
[helicopter blades thrumming]
- Sergeant.
- Thanks.
Commander.
- Victim's name was mya watkins.
She was a state's witness
Set to testify in a theft case this week.
Shooter walked up, put two in her head, and ran off.
[police radio chatter]
- How old is she, ten?
- Yeah.
- Clear everything off your plate.
This is the only case that matters.
- Homicide found two 9-mil shell casings
Next to the body.
They're on their way to ballistics for analysis now.
- Any witnesses?
- Zip.
This was a message to the neighborhood--
"don't snitch."
- Please come forward.
Any information that you give us
Will be kept completely confidential.
That's my number on that card.
So you call that number,
It'll be me on the other end of the phone.
Ma'am, ma'am.
- Mya, mya...
- Ma'am, i can't let you do that--ma'am, ma'am.
- No, mya!
- I can't let you do that ma'am.
- No, let me go!
I want to see her!
Mya!
No, let me go!
Please!
- Ma'am--
- She's all alone!
Please!
No!
- We're gonna find who did that.
- [sobbing]
- You got my word.
- No!
- Come on, come on, come on.
- [continues sobbing]
- I promise you.
- James grant, senior at anderson high
And star forward on the basketball team.
- Kid's a lock for the pros.
- Yeah, except robbery-burglary picked him up
For holding up a corner store a couple months back.
Charges wouldn't stick without an eyeball witness.
Mya was the only one willing to go on the record.
- So she was the only thing
That stood between grant going pro...
- And spending the next five years in stateville.
- All right, the coach confirmed it.
Grant was playing a tournament in evanston
At the time of the shooting.
- Maybe that was the plan--
Have eyes on grant while mya gets shot somewhere else.
- This kid's connected enough to order a hit on a witness?
- Nope, grant's not, but his uncle definitely is--
Devon tucker, o.G. Vice lord turned gun runner.
He's been looking out for his nephew
Since the boy learned how to dribble.
- Yeah, but he's locked up at mcc
On a federal weapons charge.
Think he ordered the shot from inside?
- I bet my star on it.
- Let's go have a chat.
- How long does it take to pull a guy out of his cell?
- Something's up.
Here we go.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Warden.
Who's this?
- Special agent collins, atf.
We've been working tucker for six months
To get him to flip on his weapons suppliers.
- Popular guy.
We like him for ordering a hit on a ten-year-old girl.
- So now that he's gonna play ball with us,
You want to come in and spook our best lead.
Sorry.
Not gonna happen.
- I think what special agent collins
Is trying to say-- - i've made myself clear.
Tucker's off-limits.
Anyone who can't handle that faces obstruction charges.
- I'm just saying, i'm from the neighborhood.
You're always saying, "this is our city."
Well, those are my streets.
And i don't mean to take this case personally,
But that little girl was my sister's age,
And that could have been her out there on the pavement.
You see the look in my eyes?
Ain't this what you brought me upstairs for?
Let me do this.
- No one can know, you understand?
- Yep.
- Hank voight for warden riggs.
- [sniffs]
[brakes squeal]
- Keep it moving, fellas.
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving, gentlemen.
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving, fellas.
Keep it moving.
The federal government would like to welcome you
To the metropolitan correctional center
In the city of chicago.
We do hope you enjoy your stay.
Open it up!
[gate buzzes] [gate clanking]
.
- It's about time.
Your police explorer candidates are waiting.
- Our what?
- Did you not get the memo?
I must have never written it.
Show them around the district and then report back.
If any of them have what it takes to be the police,
I want to know.
- It'd be our pleasure.
- It would?
- Hell, yeah, it would.
I was a police explorer.
- Oh.
- Where are they?
- Officers roman and burgess,
Meet, uh...
Dylan, carlos, and...
- Sparrow.
- Oh, god, whatever happened to names like mike and tommy?
- What's up with the frowns, guys?
You're police now.
Come on, get psyched.
- As far as anyone knows,
They're detainees like any other,
Which means they'll be treated as such.
I mean, only the warden knows they're inside.
Anyone else finds out, it'll shut us down.
- Who's watching over them?
- One of my best undercovers.
So, while atwater's on the inside
Trying to get tucker on a wire copping to ordering the hit,
We're out here doing everything we can
To i.D. The shooter and then link him back to tucker.
- Sounds like fun.
[chuckles]
- That's the new commander?
"sounds like fun."
Weird dude.
- I spoke to mya's mother.
She's on her way in for her interview.
- Where we at with the shell casings from the scene?
- Firing pin signature doesn't match anything in the database,
And no usable fingerprints.
Shooter was careful.
- Then we go back to basics.
Check every camera we're linked to--
Cpd pods, commercial, residential surveillance.
And run every in-service call that came in last night.
I want to be briefed.
- Got it, boss.
Hey, you got a sec?
Steve kot.
- Yeah?
- What do you know about him?
- Lawyer from the state's attorney's office?
I heard he went right back to work
The day after his kid was killed.
- Is he a stand-up guy?
- I really wouldn't know.
Olinsky would.
- Well, he's putting together a task force,
And he wants me on it.
- What?
Seriously?
- Which i'm keeping confidential.
- Task force?
- Yeah.
Why do you look so shocked?
- That's just-- [laughs]
That's--
It's big.
- Yeah.
So, if they came to you and it was offered,
What would you-- [voice murmurs]
Shh--
- Hey, herrera, you're with me today.
- You got it, boss.
- Yeah, just call me parish.
I see you transferred in from medium-security?
- Greenville.
- Well, this ain't greenville.
You ever seen jurassic park?
- A long time ago.
- Yeah, well, at the beginning,
The raptors in the electrical cages,
They keep testing the different walls
For any hint of weakness.
Well, that's what this prison is.
It's a bunch of animals looking for weakness.
So you give them nothing.
- Understood.
- Yeah.
You ready to get baptized?
Come on.
[inmates chattering, shouting]
- All right, gentlemen, let's go.
- [sighs]
Tried my whole life to avoid this place.
- It's a good reminder you were smart to keep your nose clean.
- You four, with me.
- I got a pops, a uncle, two cousins all did time.
You think i need a reminder?
- Hey.
- Hey...
Don't stare.
Check that out.
- Looks like our man tucker's got an entourage, huh?
- With his street cred, he better have a whole army.
- You said don't stare.
- Do as i say, not as i do.
- Reynolds, matt.
You're in here.
- Be safe.
- Thank you, sir.
- Hey, you need to know
I run my house like a reputable convict.
You keep the toilet spotless,
And you walk in a precise manner.
That way, we don't bump into each other
In a way that would make the other uncomfortable.
- Is that it?
- That's it.
- All right, that works for me.
- What mya did, coming forward like that,
It took courage.
- Courage got me nothing.
Nothing.
And grant's gonna walk, isn't he?
Just 'cause he can make a jump shot.
- Not if we can find somebody
Who can tie the shooter to grant.
- Already tried to help the cops once,
And what did it get me?
- You live a block away.
If you can think of anybody who might have seen something...
- And get them killed too?
- If james grant is responsible for mya's death,
He will not get away with it.
- I don't believe a word
Out of your mouth.
Can i go now?
I got to go make funeral arrangements
For my daughter.
- Whoa, hold up there.
Counselor, hold up.
- That's him!
You son of a bitch!
You killed my little girl!
You son of-- - everybody calm down!
You two, over there.
Everybody else goes home or to a holding cell.
Is that understood?
- High-school baller gets pinched
For a stupid crime.
All of a sudden...
That scholarship, those endorsement deals,
They're slipping away.
It's all 'cause some little girl saw him make a mistake.
It's obvious.
She's got to go away.
That sound about right to you?
- I haven't heard one fact
Or seen one shred of evidence
Linking my client to this murder.
- Well, maybe you had uncle devon
Take care of the witness problem for you.
He's got the juice to make it happen, right?
- Man, i ain't talked to d since he went in.
I-- - james...
You don't have to say anything.
- I know how this looks, okay?
But i had nothing to do with killing no little girl.
It's a rough neighborhood.
I'm just trying to get out.
- If there are no charges, we'll be leaving now.
- Sit down!
- Are you out of your mind?
- Get him out of here.
- Come here.
- Don't touch me!
- Get him out of here.
- Come here.
- Get your hand off me!
- Hey.
Sorry.
- I don't care where you were, kid.
As far as i'm concerned,
That was your finger on the trigger killed mya.
[thwack] you.
You're gonna answer for it.
Beat it.
- All right, give me a heads-up when you pull the recordings.
Thanks.
- Get a hit off the pods?
- Not yet.
Cpic's gonna extend the review radius
Another six blocks.
- Patrol responded to a hit-and-run collision
A half mile from our crime scene last night.
Call came in minutes after mya was killed.
- Driver in a hurry to get lost.
- Partial plate narrowed it down
To a nathan hughes in wicker park.
- Hit it.
[buzzer]
- You don't want it, i'll take it.
- Have at it.
- What are you in for, anyway?
- I killed a narc.
- It's a good thing you said that to me
And not some of these convicts.
You come in here bragging about notches on your belt,
You're gonna get tested, quick.
- Then don't ask me next time.
- West side, right?
- Who wants to know?
- Oh, man, we good.
Thought i recognized big homey from the block.
- Well, big homey don't know you, man.
- How you gonna tell me what he know?
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
Why you asking so many questions?
- Tucker, arms out, feet together.
- What's this about?
- Doc wants to see you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
- There's no mention of a medical request
On the call-out roster.
- It's just a smokescreen for the other inmates.
Word is that tucker made a deal with the feds,
And now he's going into wit-sec.
So take a good look at him, 'cause when he leaves this prison,
You will never see his pretty face again.
- Let's go.
.
- Well, if this is our shooter,
He's sure doing well for himself.
- You're not really considering this task force, are you?
- No.
That's why i showed you the card and asked you for your advice,
For the exercise.
[knock at door]
- I mean, imagine how heartbroken you'd be...
Not seeing my smiling face every day.
- [laughs] you know what?
You just settled it for me.
Thanks.
- Meaning?
- Can i help you?
- Yeah, we're looking for nathan hughes.
- I'm his daughter katie.
- Does your dad drive a black bmw x5?
- No, but i do.
If this is about the parking tickets,
I was gonna pay them.
Those jerks didn't have to tow my car.
- When was the car towed?
- Two days ago.
- So the car's still on the lot.
Thank you.
- I'll call voight.
- You guys done the trust fall yet?
- Huh?
- They're supposed to teach you that at orientation.
What are they teaching you guys these days?
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Hey.
- Some police explorers.
- Oh, yeah?
Taking a tour.
- Guys, this is detective olinsky.
He's up in intelligence.
It's a lot different than being in uniform.
All right, let's keep walking.
- Whoa.
Meaning?
- Two different worlds,
Different ways of doing things,
Treating people.
All right, guys, come on.
Let's go.
- Boys, when you become cops,
Have the courage to say what's on your mind.
Don't hide behind little riddles.
- Hey.
Peter byrne.
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- See, that's the problem.
You don't even remember his name.
2007, me and byrne were backup
At an undercover sting that went sideways.
He was shot three times right in front of you.
I was pinned down, but you could have helped him.
Instead, you let my partner bleed out
So you could go after the shooter.
Come on, guys, this way.
I'm gonna show you the lineup room.
It's a one-way mirror,
So you can see me, but i can't see you.
- Hey.
What the hell just happened out there?
- He asked.
- There's a chain of command, roman.
- Screw the chain of command.
Guys, the room was built that way
So that the witness can remain anonymous.
- Hey.
What are you doing?
- I'm explaining to the boys how the mirror works.
- Where?
- Where what?
- Where are the boys?
- Guys?
- Voight spoke to the warden.
Tucker's deal with atf was further along than we thought.
They're keeping him in protective custody
Until the marshals can transfer him to wit-sec.
- We got to get atwater up there
Before tucker disappears.
- The warden was firm.
Can't get any more involved.
We're on our own.
- Well, there's only two ways to get into protective custody.
[blowing]
Hey, lyle.
Let me see that tray for one second.
[sharp whack]
[inmates shouting] - hey, back off!
- Officer needs assistance in the dining hall!
Get back!
- I try to treat you all with respect, let you be men.
Some of you don't get it.
Fine.
Lessons will be learned.
Did you see who the target was?
- That one.
- All right, get him out of here.
- On your feet.
- What the hell did i do?
- Shut your mouth, inmate.
[handcuffs clicking]
- You two, review the tapes.
I want to know who threw the first punch... 'cause someone will go to the hole for this.
- I'm sorry to say it,
But i don't think those kids are explorers material.
- Based on your expert opinion.
- Yeah.
What did those kids do when they got an opportunity?
They ran away.
- Those kids aren't just police explorer candidates.
They're children at risk.
- Wait.
What--you mean juvies?
They're juvies?
- If we're gonna throw labels around,
They're technically fugitives now, thanks to you two.
- Is there a reason why you left that part out this morning?
- It's like when people ask me about you,
I don't say, "roman's a pain in my ass,"
Because that would be labeling you.
Look, every few months,
A judge in juvenile court sends me a few kids
She's released on good behavior.
And i pull strings to get those kids into this district
And show them they can still turn their lives around,
And it's never been a problem until i trusted you two nitwits.
- Don't blame this on--
- Can any of you tell me why three boys were just seen
Driving my take-home car out of the district?
- Commander...
Our two finest patrolmen are on it.
God.
- Help you folks?
- Yeah.
Car from this lot was spotted at a crime scene--
No record of it ever being towed, so...
Somehow it left the premises last night
And wound up back here.
- Well, this ain't a drive-through.
It's an auto impound.
No vehicle goes in or out unless a form gets filled
Or it's on the back of a truck.
- How does a car get in and out of the lot
Without going into the system?
- That's a good question.
Wait here.
Let me get the manager.
- This new patrolman, roman...
- Mm.
- What's his story?
- No idea.
Why?
- It's no reason.
Just...
- Al...
I've known you 25 years.
Every time you say "no reason"--
- Oh, no.
- What?
Oh, man.
[both groan]
All right.
Take that way!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oops.
- All right, let's start again.
About that beemer...
- Ah!
[metal creaking]
.
- You've got hours, not days.
If you're gonna get to tucker, now is the time.
- Yeah.
- So when you get inside...
- I know how to play this.
[buzzer]
- Supervisor ordered this inmate into protective custody.
The paperwork's on its way up.
- 10-4.
- Come on, man!
I'm just trying to make a couple bucks.
- So you took out a contract on a ten-year-old?
- What the hell's he talking about?
- Whoever was driving that beemer last night
Murdered a little girl.
- Mm-hmm.
- Whoa.
Maybe i rented a car
To someone trying to impress a date.
- Uh-huh.
- But nobody said nothing about a murder.
- You tell me who was behind the wheel,
Or i hang the whole thing on you.
[metal clattering]
It's your choice.
[low murmuring]
- You been going through a lot of trouble
To get at me, son.
If bonds and his crew sent you...
- Aw, come on, man, it ain't on that.
I'm straight.
I used to roll with raekwon and slick
Out there on 78th street.
- Yeah?
What's slick up to?
- You know how slick get down.
Got caught up with one of them hispanic honies
Out there in rogers park.
- [chuckles]
Boy can't help it.
- Yeah, he ain't playin'.
- What you need?
I need to rap with you about your nephew james.
- What about him?
- Well, you know the little girl that's about to snitch?
She just got popped.
- James' business ain't got nothing to do with me.
- Yo, is there a problem?
- Naw.
He was just leaving.
- At least it's in one piece.
- Why would she call them police explorers?
Can't just throw that name around.
I took an oath.
- Yeah, i don't think platt knew you felt so strongly--
Me neither, frankly.
- Officers.
I've heard of these flash mobs before,
But i never thought three boys could do this much damage.
- Do you have any idea which way they went?
- Oh, a pretty good one.
My husband stopped them before they made it out the door.
- He said he'd bust my kneecaps.
- I'm tempted to do it myself.
- Dude, we were just having fun.
Chill, all right?
- Excuse me?
And you figured stealing the commander's car
And shoplifting was the way to do it?
- I should have known you guys
Weren't explorers when i saw you.
Honor, courage, and service:
That's what the program teaches you.
- [snickers] - you think this is funny?
You know how many people
Put their ass on the line for you guys?
Platt, the judge, us.
You won't be laughing when we send your ass back to juvie.
- I knew my man was the real deal
Soon as he walked in this place.
Took that tray and went, bah!
Right across big boy's back.
Yo, i'm telling you.
Us white folks got to stick together in here.
[ahem]
- What's up, fellas?
- Haven't you heard?
They put a cop in here.
- No.
- It's true.
So how'd you know?
- How'd i know what, man?
- The guy you stomped in chow,
The one who was trying to talk to devon...
- Yeah?
- He's police.
- Really?
What makes you say that?
- Some puerto rican kid on the second tier
Swears he got pinched by him a few months back.
- Reynolds!
- Yeah.
- Hands behind your back.
- Disciplinary hearing officer just weighed in.
You're going to the hole, fish.
- No, what?
No.
Wait, wait, wait.
Aw, come on, man.
- Hey, let me ask you something.
- Yeah.
- Remember john reed from that heist crew,
You know, around '07?
- Yeah, yeah, guy was a killer,
Almost took out a few of us that night.
What makes you think of reed?
- Well, i got this new kid, roman,
Who's giving me grief over how it went down.
So...
That was a clean bust, right?
- Alvin, that was a clean bust.
- Okay, tow clerk rented the car to omar martel.
Martel was detained with tucker at mcc until a few months ago.
- Bingo.
- He used to run a stick-up crew
Ripping off dealers
And killing them for fun.
- Right.
- Now all of his boys are either dead or in jail,
So he's branched out to murder-for-hire.
Last known address is on west 23rd and pilsen.
- And grant's cell phone records show him pinging a tower
Near martel's house two days before mya was killed.
This is our shooter.
- Beautiful.
All right, let's roll out.
[muffed hip-hop plays]
♪ ♪
Hold on.
[knocking] [quietly] chicago police.
[hip-hop louder]
- Clear!
- [gasps] [whimpering]
- Nod your head "yes" or "no," is he back there?
.
- Shh.
[hip-hop continues]
- Ah!
Ugh!
What the hell y'all want?
- Tough guy, huh?
- [groans]
- You think you're hard?
Killing a child...
Listen to me.
This can go down a lot of different ways.
But only one of them ends well for you.
- Hey, voight...
- I'm busy.
- It's antonio.
- You got nothing on me.
- We'll see about that.
[buzzer]
- Get your hands off me, man.
You can't put me in here.
You don't understand.
You don't understand!
All right, listen.
Let me make a phone call, one phone call.
- If you didn't want to lose your privileges,
You shouldn't have started that fight.
- One phone call.
That's all i'm asking.
It's one phone call--
Ugh!
- Don't make me repeat myself.
- You son of a bi--
Ugh!
Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right.
Let me see herrera.
- Uh, what did you say?
- Herrera, the guard, tell him i'm here, man.
Please.
- Just got off the phone with voight.
We got a name for the shooter...
Omar martel.
He's tucker's old cellmate.
If you're gonna get any leverage on martel,
This is it.
Use the name to get him talking.
- You want to tell me why an inmate in solitary
Is demanding to speak to you?
- What do you mean?
- I got no tolerance for dirty guards.
Clean out your locker.
You got 15 minutes to get out of my prison.
- I'm a cpd undercover
Trying to pin the murder of a ten-year-old girl
On an inmate who ordered the hit from here.
I know you're doing your job, but i got to do mine.
Please, help us out.
- Come on, come on.
Got to let me out of here!
God.
- Thought i was clear.
- You got to hear me out.
- Walk away now.
- I got a message from omar martel.
I ain't playing.
He got picked up last night.
He said he's gonna flip on james unless you give him more cash.
You want to talk to me now?
- He's already getting 10% of the kid's rookie contract.
- He say he needs at least another 10.
- James wanted to cap that girl himself.
Couldn't let that happen.
I knew martel would be down for whatever.
Didn't think he'd jam me up.
- What you want me to tell him, big homey?
- 5%, that's it.
- Yo, stop talking to this fool.
- Hey, this don't even concern you, dawg.
- Tucker, man, this guy is a cop.
- No, big homey.
- Say what?
- Yeah, it's all over d-unit.
- Get the door.
.
[inmates shouting]
- Ah!
[alarm blaring]
- Stop it, atwater!
It's over!
It's over, kev!
Come on, come on, it's over.
It's over!
- Hell yeah, i'm a cop, you punk-ass bitch!
And i got you on a wire for murder!
[alarm blaring] [background commotion]
- Here's the report from the store they hit,
Something else that you can share
With that judge in juvie court.
- Can i have a word with you, alone?
Listen up, 'cause i'm only gonna say this once.
I messed up.
I know, it's strange for me too.
It was wrong of me to present those boys as police explorers.
But if it makes a difference,
I'm gonna throw the book at them.
Grand theft auto, retail theft, evading a police officer.
Those three aren't gonna see the light of day
Before their 18th birthday.
- Before you do any of that, just give me a minute.
- Patrolman...
- You owe me.
I'm letting you guys go.
- You are?
- When i was your age, me and my buddies,
We took an el train for a joyride.
The cop who picked us up,
He could have dropped the hammer on us,
Ruined our lives.
But instead, he let us go.
He said, "everybody gets one break,
Even if they don't deserve it."
Now this is yours.
I know you guys think this is lame,
But if you ever want to join the explorers,
Like, for real,
Give me a call.
Changed my life.
Could change yours.
Now get out of here.
- Officer...
You know, when does this explorers thing meet?
- Saturday morning, 8:00.
- The thing about prison ball is
You don't want to be the punk on fouls.
Makes you look soft.
That's how you end up being someone's sweetheart.
[engine turns over] [siren wailing]
- Hey, ms.
Watkins...
I wanted you to hear from me first.
We got him.
We got grant; we got his uncle;
we got the shooter.
We got 'em all.
- Thank you.
- All right?
- [sobbing]
- You know...
There were other cops at that scene that night,
Not just me.
- When he was bleeding out, you were the closest one.
You could have helped him.
- I was in pursuit of a known felon...
- We all were there.
- Wanted for a double homicide.
I mean, i saw that you were nearby,
You were able to help your partner out.
So i kept going.
And i'm glad i did, 'cause we caught that son of a bitch.
And i would do it exactly the same way again.
So you can bring your old partner here,
And i would tell him myself.
- He's back in milwaukee, living on disability.
He's gonna be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
- I was beginning to think you wouldn't call.
- I wasn't planning on it.
- And yet, you did.
- Look, i don't play politics,
And i didn't become a cop to get my picture in the paper.
But last night i knelt over the body
Of a ten-year-old girl with two bullet holes in her head.
So if you're telling me that this task force
Could help me get ahead of cases like that
Instead of cleaning up after them...
- That's exactly the goal.
You do well on this task force, erin,
You can write your own ticket.
You can go after any cases you want.
- [sighs]
- How'd you get that cut?
- Doing police work.
- In that new intelligence thing?
- Yeah.
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, i love it.
- What?
- Just looking at you.
I'm proud of you.
- Proud of you too.
- You know you mean the world to me, right?
You sure the controller's not busted?
You wish.
Hey, don't hate on her 'cause she's whupping you, Burgess.
Seriously, these buttons are stuck.
Seriously, you're not good.
[Scoffs]
[Phone beeps]
Hey, Vinessa, finish that homework, huh?
One second.
So why don't you guys work together anymore?
- What's up?
- Um...
Uh, because your brother's in Intelligence now.
He's a big shot.
- Oh, why aren't you?
- Right.
Okay.
Be right there.
That's a good question.
Yo, Burgess, something just popped off.
Will you, uh...
Yeah, yeah, no worries.
I got her.
Hey, Vinessa, be good, girl.
[Door closes]
Hey, it's okay.
He'll be back soon.
All right, let's do this.
Oh, no.
[Helicopter blades thrumming]
- Sergeant.
- Thanks.
Commander.
Victim's name was Mya Watkins.
She was a state's witness set to testify in a theft case this week.
Shooter walked up, put two in her head, and ran off.
[Police radio chatter]
How old is she, ten?
Yeah.
Clear everything off your plate.
This is the only case that matters.
Homicide found two 9-mil shell casings next to the body.
They're on their way to ballistics for analysis now.
Any witnesses?
Zip.
This was a message to the neighborhood...
"Don't snitch."
Please come forward.
Any information that you give us will be kept completely confidential.
That's my number on that card.
So you call that number, it'll be me on the other end of the phone.
- Ma'am, ma'am.
- Mya, Mya...
Ma'am, I can't let you do that... ma'am, ma'am.
- No, Mya!
- I can't let you do that ma'am.
No, let me go!
I want to see her!
Mya!
No, let me go!
- Please!
- Ma'am...
She's all alone!
Please!
No!
- We're gonna find who did that.
- [Sobbing]
- You got my word.
- No!
Come on, come on, come on.
[Continues sobbing]
I promise you.
James Grant, senior at Anderson High and star forward on the basketball team.
Kid's a lock for the pros.
Yeah, except robbery-burglary picked him up for holding up a corner store a couple months back.
Charges wouldn't stick without an eyeball witness.
Mya was the only one willing to go on the record.
So she was the only thing that stood between Grant going pro...
And spending the next five years in Stateville.
All right, the coach confirmed it.
Grant was playing a tournament in Evanston
- at the time of the shooting.
- Maybe that was the plan... have eyes on Grant while Mya gets shot somewhere else.
This kid's connected enough to order a hit on a witness?
Nope, Grant's not, but his uncle definitely is...
Devon Tucker, O.G. vice lord turned gun runner.
He's been looking out for his nephew since the boy learned how to dribble.
Yeah, but he's locked up at MCC on a federal weapons charge.
Think he ordered the shot from inside?
I bet my star on it.
Let's go have a chat.
How long does it take to pull a guy out of his cell?
Something's up.
Here we go.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Warden.
Who's this?
Special Agent Collins, ATF.
We've been working Tucker for six months to get him to flip on his weapons suppliers.
Popular guy.
We like him for ordering a hit on a ten-year-old girl.
So now that he's gonna play ball with us, you want to come in and spook our best lead.
Sorry.
Not gonna happen.
I think what Special Agent Collins
- is trying to say...
- I've made myself clear.
Tucker's off-limits.
Anyone who can't handle that faces obstruction charges.
I'm just saying, I'm from the neighborhood.
You're always saying, "this is our city."
Well, those are my streets.
And I don't mean to take this case personally, but that little girl was my sister's age, and that could have been her out there on the pavement.
You see the look in my eyes?
Ain't this what you brought me upstairs for?
Let me do this.
No one can know, you understand?
Yep.
Hank Voight for Warden Riggs.
[Sniffs]
[Brakes squeal]
Keep it moving, fellas.
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving, gentlemen.
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving, fellas.
Keep it moving.
The federal government would like to welcome you to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in the city of Chicago.
We do hope you enjoy your stay.
Open it up!
[Gate buzzes]
[Gate clanking]
It's about time.
Your Police Explorer candidates are waiting.
Our what?
Did you not get the memo?
I must have never written it.
Show them around the district and then report back.
If any of them have what it takes to be the police,
I want to know.
It'd be our pleasure.
It would?
Hell, yeah, it would.
I was a Police Explorer.
Oh.
Where are they?
Officers Roman and Burgess, meet, uh...
Dylan, Carlos, and...
Sparrow.
Oh, God, whatever happened to names like Mike and Tommy?
What's up with the frowns, guys?
You're police now.
Come on, get psyched.
As far as anyone knows, they're detainees like any other, which means they'll be treated as such.
I mean, only the warden knows they're inside.
Anyone else finds out, it'll shut us down.
Who's watching over them?
One of my best undercovers.
So, while Atwater's on the inside trying to get Tucker on a wire copping to ordering the hit, we're out here doing everything we can to I.D. the shooter and then link him back to Tucker.
Sounds like fun. [Chuckles]
That's the new commander?
"Sounds like fun."
Weird dude.
I spoke to Mya's mother.
She's on her way in for her interview.
Where we at with the shell casings from the scene?
Firing pin signature doesn't match anything in the database, and no usable fingerprints.
Shooter was careful.
Then we go back to basics.
Check every camera we're linked to...
CPD pods, commercial, residential surveillance.
And run every in-service call that came in last night.
I want to be briefed.
Got it, boss.
Hey, you got a sec?
Steve Kot.
Yeah?
What do you know about him?
Lawyer from the state's attorney's office?
I heard he went right back to work the day after his kid was killed.
Is he a stand-up guy?
I really wouldn't know.
Olinsky would.
Well, he's putting together a task force, and he wants me on it.
What?
Seriously?
Which I'm keeping confidential.
Task force?
Yeah.
Why do you look so shocked?
That's just... [Laughs]
That's... it's big.
Yeah.
So, if they came to you and it was offered,
- what would you...
- [Voice murmurs]
Shh...
Hey, Herrera, you're with me today.
You got it, boss.
Yeah, just call me Parish.
I see you transferred in from medium-security?
Greenville.
Well, this ain't Greenville.
You ever seen Jurassic Park?
A long time ago.
Yeah, well, at the beginning, the raptors in the electrical cages, they keep testing the different walls for any hint of weakness.
Well, that's what this prison is.
It's a bunch of animals looking for weakness.
So you give them nothing.
Understood.
Yeah.
You ready to get baptized?
Come on.
[Inmates chattering, shouting]
All right, gentlemen, let's go.
[Sighs]
Tried my whole life to avoid this place.
It's a good reminder you were smart to keep your nose clean.
You four, with me.
I got a pops, a uncle, two cousins all did time.
You think I need a reminder?
- Hey.
- Hey...
Don't stare.
Check that out.
Looks like our man Tucker's got an entourage, huh?
With his street cred, he better have a whole army.
You said don't stare.
Do as I say, not as I do.
Reynolds, Matt.
You're in here.
Be safe.
Thank you, sir.
Hey, you need to know
I run my house like a reputable convict.
You keep the toilet spotless, and you walk in a precise manner.
That way, we don't bump into each other in a way that would make the other uncomfortable.
- Is that it?
- That's it.
All right, that works for me.
What Mya did, coming forward like that, it took courage.
Courage got me nothing.
Nothing.
And Grant's gonna walk, isn't he?
Just 'cause he can make a jump shot.
Not if we can find somebody who can tie the shooter to Grant.
Already tried to help the cops once, and what did it get me?
You live a block away.
If you can think of anybody who might have seen something...
And get them killed too?
If James Grant is responsible for Mya's death, he will not get away with it.
I don't believe a word out of your mouth.
Can I go now?
I got to go make funeral arrangements for my daughter.
Whoa, hold up there.
Counselor, hold up.
That's him!
You son of a bitch!
You killed my little girl!
- You son of...
- Everybody calm down!
You two, over there.
Everybody else goes home or to a holding cell.
Is that understood?
High-school baller gets pinched for a stupid crime.
All of a sudden... that scholarship, those endorsement deals, they're slipping away.
It's all 'cause some little girl saw him make a mistake.
It's obvious.
She's got to go away.
That sound about right to you?
I haven't heard one fact or seen one shred of evidence linking my client to this murder.
Well, maybe you had Uncle Devon take care of the witness problem for you.
He's got the juice to make it happen, right?
Man, I ain't talked to D since he went in.
- I...
- James...
You don't have to say anything.
I know how this looks, okay?
But I had nothing to do with killing no little girl.
It's a rough neighborhood.
I'm just trying to get out.
If there are no charges, we'll be leaving now.
- Sit down!
- Are you out of your mind?
- Get him out of here.
- Come here.
- Don't touch me!
- Get him out of here.
- Come here.
- Get your hand off me!
Hey.
Sorry.
I don't care where you were, kid.
As far as I'm concerned, that was your finger on the trigger killed Mya.
[Thwack] You.
You're gonna answer for it.
Beat it.
All right, give me a heads-up when you pull the recordings.
Thanks.
- Get a hit off the pods?
- Not yet.
CPIC's gonna extend the review radius another six blocks.
Patrol responded to a hit-and-run collision a half mile from our crime scene last night.
Call came in minutes after Mya was killed.
Driver in a hurry to get lost.
Partial plate narrowed it down to a Nathan Hughes in Wicker Park.
Hit it.
[Buzzer]
You don't want it, I'll take it.
Have at it.
What are you in for, anyway?
I killed a narc.
It's a good thing you said that to me and not some of these convicts.
You come in here bragging about notches on your belt, you're gonna get tested, quick.
Then don't ask me next time.
West Side, right?
- Who wants to know?
- Oh, man, we good.
Thought I recognized big homey from the block.
Well, big homey don't know you, man.
How you gonna tell me what he know?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
Why you asking so many questions?
Tucker, arms out, feet together.
What's this about?
Doc wants to see you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
There's no mention of a medical request on the call-out roster.
It's just a smokescreen for the other inmates.
Word is that Tucker made a deal with the feds, and now he's going into WITSEC.
So take a good look at him, 'cause when he leaves this prison, you will never see his pretty face again.
Let's go.
Well, if this is our shooter, he's sure doing well for himself.
You're not really considering this task force, are you?
No.
That's why I showed you the card and asked you for your advice, for the exercise.
[Knock at door]
I mean, imagine how heartbroken you'd be...
Not seeing my smiling face every day.
[Laughs] You know what?
You just settled it for me.
Thanks.
Meaning?
Can I help you?
Yeah, we're looking for Nathan Hughes.
I'm his daughter Katie.
Does your dad drive a black BMW X5?
No, but I do.
If this is about the parking tickets,
I was gonna pay them.
Those jerks didn't have to tow my car.
- When was the car towed?
- Two days ago.
So the car's still on the lot.
- Thank you.
- I'll call Voight.
You guys done the trust fall yet?
Huh?
They're supposed to teach you that at orientation.
What are they teaching you guys these days?
Hey, what's going on here?
Hey.
Some Police Explorers.
Oh, yeah?
Taking a tour.
Guys, this is Detective Olinsky.
He's up in Intelligence.
It's a lot different than being in uniform.
All right, let's keep walking.
Whoa.
Meaning?
Two different worlds, different ways of doing things, treating people.
All right, guys, come on.
- Let's go.
- Boys, when you become cops, have the courage to say what's on your mind.
Don't hide behind little riddles.
Hey.
Peter Byrne.
Is that supposed to mean something?
See, that's the problem.
You don't even remember his name.
2007, me and Byrne were backup at an undercover sting that went sideways.
He was shot three times right in front of you.
I was pinned down, but you could have helped him.
Instead, you let my partner bleed out so you could go after the shooter.
Come on, guys, this way.
I'm gonna show you the lineup room.
It's a one-way mirror, so you can see me, but I can't see you.
Hey.
What the hell just happened out there?
He asked.
There's a chain of command, Roman.
Screw the chain of command.
Guys, the room was built that way so that the witness can remain anonymous.
Hey.
What are you doing?
I'm explaining to the boys how the mirror works.
- Where?
- Where what?
Where are the boys?
Guys?
Voight spoke to the warden.
Tucker's deal with ATF was further along than we thought.
They're keeping him in protective custody until the marshals can transfer him to WITSEC.
We got to get Atwater up there before Tucker disappears.
The warden was firm.
Can't get any more involved.
We're on our own.
Well, there's only two ways to get into protective custody.
[Blowing]
Hey, Lyle.
Let me see that tray for one second.
[Sharp whack]
- [Inmates shouting]
- Hey, back off!
Officer needs assistance in the dining hall!
Get back!
I try to treat you all with respect, let you be men.
Some of you don't get it.
Fine.
Lessons will be learned.
- Did you see who the target was?
- That one.
All right, get him out of here.
On your feet.
What the hell did I do?
Shut your mouth, inmate.
[Handcuffs clicking]
You two, review the tapes.
I want to know who threw the first punch... 'cause someone will go to the hole for this.
I'm sorry to say, but I don't think those kids are Explorers material.
Based on your expert opinion.
Yeah.
What did those kids do when they got an opportunity?
They ran away.
Those kids aren't just Police Explorer candidates.
They're children at risk.
Wait.
What... you mean juvies?
They're juvies?
If we're gonna throw labels around, they're technically fugitives now, thanks to you two.
Is there a reason why you left that part out this morning?
It's like when people ask me about you,
I don't say, "Roman's a pain in my ass,"
because that would be labeling you.
Look, every few months, a judge in juvenile court sends me a few kids she's released on good behavior.
And I pull strings to get those kids into this district and show them they can still turn their lives around, and it's never been a problem until I trusted you two nitwits.
Don't blame this on...
Can any of you tell me why three boys were just seen driving my take-home car out of the district?
Commander...
Our two finest patrolmen are on it.
God.
Help you folks?
Yeah.
Car from this lot was spotted at a crime scene... no record of it ever being towed, so...
Somehow it left the premises last night and wound up back here.
Well, this ain't a drive-through.
It's an auto impound.
No vehicle goes in or out unless a form gets filled or it's on the back of a truck.
How does a car get in and out of the lot without going into the system?
That's a good question.
Wait here.
Let me get the manager.
This new patrolman, Roman...
Mm.
What's his story?
No idea.
Why?
It's no reason.
Just...
Al...
I've known you 25 years.
Every time you say "no reason"...
Oh, no.
What?
- Oh, man.
- [Both groan]
All right.
Take that way!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oops.
All right, let's start again.
About that Beemer...
Ah!
[Metal creaking]
You've got hours, not days.
- If you gotta get to Tucker, now is the time.
- Yeah.
So when you get inside...
I know how to play this.
My supervisor ordered this inmate in protective custody.
- Paperwork's on its way in.
- 10-4.
Come on, man!
I'm just trying to make a couple bucks.
So you took out a contract on a ten-year-old?
What the hell's he talking about?
Whoever was driving that Beemer last night murdered a little girl.
Mm-hmm.
Whoa.
Maybe I rented a car to someone trying to impress a date.
Uh-huh.
But nobody said nothing about a murder.
You tell me who was behind the wheel, or I hang the whole thing on you.
[Metal clattering]
It's your choice.
[Low murmuring]
You been going through a lot of trouble to get at me, son.
If Bonds and his crew sent you...
Aw, come on, man, it ain't on that.
I'm straight.
I used to roll with Raekwon and Slick out there on 78th Street.
Yeah?
What's Slick up to?
You know how Slick get down.
Got caught up with one of them Hispanic honies out there in Rogers Park.
[Chuckles]
Boy can't help it.
Yeah, he ain't playin'.
What you need?
I need to rap with you about your nephew James.
What about him?
Well, you know the little girl that's about to snitch?
She just got popped.
James' business ain't got nothing to do with me.
Yo, is there a problem?
Naw.
He was just leaving.
At least it's in one piece.
Why would she call them Police Explorers?
Can't just throw that name around.
I took an oath.
Yeah, I don't think Platt knew you felt so strongly... me neither, frankly.
Officers.
I've heard of these flash mobs before, but I never thought three boys could do this much damage.
Do you have any idea which way they went?
Oh, a pretty good one.
My husband stopped them before they made it out the door.
He said he'd bust my kneecaps.
I'm tempted to do it myself.
Dude, we were just having fun.
Chill, all right?
Excuse me?
And you figured stealing the commander's car and shoplifting was the way to do it?
I should have known you guys weren't Explorers when I saw you.
Honor, courage, and service:
That's what the program teaches you.
- [Snickers]
- You think this is funny?
You know how many people put their ass on the line for you guys?
Platt, the judge, us.
You won't be laughing when we send your ass back to juvie.
I knew my man was the real deal soon as he walked in this place.
Took that tray and went, bah!
Right across big boy's back.
Yo, I'm telling you.
Us white folks got to stick together in here.
[Ahem]
What's up, fellas?
Haven't you heard?
They put a cop in here.
No.
It's true.
So how'd you know?
How'd I know what, man?
The guy you stomped in chow, the one who was trying to talk to Devon...
- Yeah?
- He's police.
Really?
What makes you say that?
Some Puerto Rican kid on the second tier swears he got pinched by him a few months back.
Reynolds!
Yeah.
Hands behind your back.
Disciplinary hearing officer just weighed in.
You're going to the hole, fish.
No, what?
No.
Wait, wait, wait.
Aw, come on, man.
- Hey, let me ask you something.
- Yeah.
Remember John Reed from that heist crew, you know, around '07?
Yeah, yeah, guy was a killer, almost took out a few of us that night.
What makes you think of Reed?
Well, I got this new kid, Roman, who's giving me grief over how it went down.
So...
That was a clean bust, right?
Alvin, that was a clean bust.
Okay, tow clerk rented the car to Omar Martel.
Martel was detained with Tucker at MCC until a few months ago.
- Bingo.
- He used to run a stick-up crew ripping off dealers
- and killing them for fun.
- Right.
Now all of his boys are either dead or in jail, so he's branched out to murder-for-hire.
Last known address is on west 23rd and Pilsen.
And Grant's cell phone records show him pinging a tower near Martel's house two days before Mya was killed.
This is our shooter.
Beautiful.
All right, let's roll out.
[Muffed hip-hop plays]
♪ ♪
Hold on.
[Knocking]
[Quietly] Chicago police.
[Hip-hop louder]
Clear!
[Gasps]
[Whimpering]
Nod your head "yes" or "no," is he back there?
Shh.
[Hip-hop continues]
Ah!
Ugh!
What the hell y'all want?
Tough guy, huh?
[Groans]
You think you're hard?
Killing a child...
Listen to me.
This can go down a lot of different ways.
But only one of them ends well for you.
Hey, Voight...
I'm busy.
It's Antonio.
You got nothing on me.
We'll see about that.
[Buzzer]
Get your hands off me, man.
You can't put me in here.
You don't understand.
You don't understand!
All right, listen.
Let me make a phone call, one phone call.
If you didn't want to lose your privileges, you shouldn't have started that fight.
One phone call.
That's all I'm asking.
It's one phone call...
Ugh!
Don't make me repeat myself.
You son of a bi...
Ugh!
Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right.
Let me see Herrera.
Uh, what did you say?
Herrera, the guard, tell him I'm here, man.
Please.
Just got off the phone with Voight.
We got a name for the shooter...
Omar Martel.
He's Tucker's old cellmate.
If you're gonna get any leverage on Martel, this is it.
Use the name to get him talking.
You want to tell me why an inmate in solitary is demanding to speak to you?
What do you mean?
I got no tolerance for dirty guards.
Clean out your locker.
You got 15 minutes to get out of my prison.
I'm a CPD undercover trying to pin the murder of a ten-year-old girl on an inmate who ordered the hit from here.
I know you're doing your job, but I got to do mine.
Please, help us out.
Come on, come on.
Got to let me out of here!
God.
Thought I was clear.
You got to hear me out.
Walk away now.
I got a message from Omar Martel.
I ain't playing.
He got picked up last night.
He said he's gonna flip on James unless you give him more cash.
You want to talk to me now?
He's already getting 10% of the kid's rookie contract.
He say he needs at least another 10.
James wanted to cap that girl himself.
Couldn't let that happen.
I knew Martel would be down for whatever.
Didn't think he'd jam me up.
What you want me to tell him, big homey?
5%, that's it.
Yo, stop talking to this fool.
Hey, this don't even concern you, dawg.
Tucker, man, this guy is a cop.
No, big homey.
Say what?
Yeah, it's all over D-unit.
Get the door.
[Inmates shouting]
Ah!
[Alarm blaring]
Stop it, Atwater!
It's over!
It's over, Kev!
Come on, come on, it's over.
It's over!
Hell yeah, I'm a cop, you punk-ass bitch!
And I got you on a wire for murder!
[Alarm blaring]
[Background commotion]
Here's the report from the store they hit, something else that you can share with that judge in juvie court.
Can I have a word with you, alone?
Listen up, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once.
I messed up.
I know, it's strange for me too.
It was wrong of me to present those boys as Police Explorers.
But if it makes a difference,
I'm gonna throw the book at them.
Grand theft auto, retail theft, evading a police officer.
Those three aren't gonna see the light of day before their 18th birthday.
Before you do any of that, just give me a minute.
Patrolman...
You owe me.
I'm letting you guys go.
You are?
When I was your age, me and my buddies, we took an el train for a joyride.
The cop who picked us up, he could have dropped the hammer on us, ruined our lives.
But instead, he let us go.
He said, "everybody gets one break, even if they don't deserve it."
Now this is yours.
I know you guys think this is lame, but if you ever want to join the Explorers, like, for real, give me a call.
Changed my life.
Could change yours.
Now get out of here.
Officer...
You know, when does this Explorers thing meet?
Saturday morning, 8:00.
The thing about prison ball is you don't want to be the punk on fouls.
Makes you look soft.
That's how you end up being someone's sweetheart.
[Engine turns over]
[Siren wailing]
Hey, Ms. Watkins...
I wanted you to hear from me first.
We got him.
We got Grant, we got his uncle, we got the shooter.
We got 'em all.
Thank you.
All right?
[Sobbing]
You know...
There were other cops at that scene that night, not just me.
When he was bleeding out, you were the closest one.
You could have helped him.
I was in pursuit of a known felon...
We all were there.
Wanted for a double homicide.
I mean, I saw that you were nearby, you were able to help your partner out.
So I kept going.
And I'm glad I did, 'cause we caught that son of a bitch.
And I would do it exactly the same way again.
So you can bring your old partner here, and I would tell him myself.
He's back in Milwaukee, living on disability.
He's gonna be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
I was beginning to think you wouldn't call.
I wasn't planning on it.
And yet, you did.
Look, I don't play politics, and I didn't become a cop to get my picture in the paper.
But last night I knelt over the body of a ten-year-old girl with two bullet holes in her head.
So if you're telling me that this task force could help me get ahead of cases like that instead of cleaning up after them...
That's exactly the goal.
You do well on this task force, Erin, you can write your own ticket.
You can go after any cases you want.
[Sighs]
How'd you get that cut?
Doing police work.
In that new Intelligence thing?
Yeah.
Do you like it?
Yeah, I love it.
What?
Just looking at you.
I'm proud of you.
Proud of you too.
You know you mean the world to me, right?
Congratulations!
Let's hope the bride is not pregnant
Here I come, my dear
Come on
Come on
Finish the banana then you can bring the bride
Come on.
Bite it!
Higher!
Bite it!
Getting married on a Chinese New Year's Eve, I've never seen this before
What's the rush?
Stop asking the obvious question, hypocrite
Bite it!
Pass it!
Come on, open up!
Ninety eight
Two more, two more
Ninety nine
One more, one more, one hundred, one hundred
The last round, squeeze the milk
Burst it, burst it, harder, harder
Hey!
where are you going?
Come on, squeeze it
Dong, what is all this nonsense
Your daughter's wedding is embarrassing
It's just like making a porn movie
And your son-in-law's hair ls just so inappropriate
I feel sorry for you being a host
Chuan, don't get angry so easily
It's easy to get a stroke at our age
These are typical youngsters
We are getting old
Be more open-minded, don't get angry
Sweet head, if you are truly a highland girl
Then you should be used to these winding roads
I wasn't born here
Stand still.
I'm going to puke on you
No, don't!
Come here
Please welcome the bride and groom
Fetch the bride with the umbrella
Blessed by sky, blessed by earth, blessed to be taken care by your new family
Wish the couple with blessings and good fortune
Dong, you love your daughter so much
Why didn't you throw a banquet?
These youngsters have their own thinking
I'm fine as long as they are happy with it
The youngsters nowadays don't know the ways of the world
Don't you know too at this age?
Getting married is a matter of prime
You should invite all our old classmates
My daughter thinks it's too troublesome to send out invitations
Anyway, as long as everyone is happy
Sending out invitations is troublesome?
If it's my daughter's wedding
I'll send the invitation to any places I can reach
Is it for real, Uncle Chuan?
Yes, and I will honor my word
If I fail to do so, I shall be struck by thunder
I need the toilet really bad
I gotta go.
Let's go
Benji
Not that way, this way
Which way?
This way
Can you go a little bit faster?
Please, can you just hurry a little bit?
Ok, nearly there
Benji you dropped my drawing
Or I'm gonna shit my pants
Hurry
Hello
Hello, Uncle, can u please open the door
Uncle
Hello, is there anybody home?
Uncle, please open the door
He is probably out.
Just hang on for a while
What you mean he's out?
What are the bloody chances.
Shit!
I told you he is out
Oh yes!
Go go go!
HEY
What are you doing?
I've got no time to explain
No.
If he finds out
He's gonna be pissed
Well, he is not going to find out, is he?
Whatever
Come on.
Just work for me
Ghost!
Ghost!
Ghost!
Ghost!
Uncle Chuan, there's a ghost at your place
A ghost?
What ghost?
There's someone prying your door
You'll be left with nothing if you don't go back now
I don't know what you are driveling about
Come on
Shit!
I'll pry it
No
It gotta happen
No
White man
Don't move
White man, don't you move
Catch him.
Stop him from running away
Uncle Chuan is here
Eating too much potatoes must have made you crazy
You come back all the way from UK with a motorbike?
Who wants potatoes?
I didn't buy it
Bee, you haven't been back for so long
I heard that you are back
Hi, my name is Benji
Ah Gao
Uncle, it's early that you pay me
I don't want to owe money during Chinese New Year
Oh no, round 2
Bee, I know you like the scallops
I've added a lot in it
Don't act like you father
He's too stingy to add more even if he likes it
Smells good
No
Bee, what does your boy friend do for a living?
He is a singer in the band
Stage singer?
He must have earned a lot
You have to throw a big banquet for your wedding
Your dad has to save his face
You have to make it great
At least 88 tables, am I smart or what?
We are engaged.
We didn't plan to throw a banquet actually
That's a worry
Your dad told everyone
If he doesn't throw a banquet for his daughter's wedding
He will take the punishment of a thunderstrike
Ah Gao, are you nuts?
You used-up my scallops.
They're not cheap, you know?
I'll pay you back, ok?
You've not been back for so many years
Yet you humiliated me the moment you got back
You kidding me?
You offering me the chicken head?
Benji, the chicken head is not for eating
Oh, buggar, sorry, I didn't realize
Cut the crap
Giving me the chicken head on New Year's Eve
Trying to bring me bad luck this year?
He didn't mean it
Can you be more reasonable?
Look at you, you can't even speak Chinese properly
You don't even sound like a Chinese
Had all the men died out?
Out of all men, you fall in love with a westerner
You expect me to speak in English?
I wanted to learn Chinese
It was you who forced me to go to England
So now I've become English
Isn't that what you wanted?
I've asked you to come back, but you refused
And you even continued to study painting!
Painting?
Guess who brought me to learn that at the first place?
It was you
So now everything I do is just not right in your eyes
And, getting married is a matter of prime
Have I been informed?
The reason why I'm back this time ls to tell you about my marriage
Isn't it too late?
Why don't you tell me when I'm dead?
Stop it, I object
Mr chicken head
Hey, come on
Don't let this get you down
You said yourself your dad was a difficult man
Just look ahead, sweetheart
Look to the sparkling sea and the white sand
We'll find some sweet little secluded beach somewhere
You can relax
And finish off your thesis painting
This here is just a detour
You come out!
Men and women are not allowed to be in one room
What did he say?
He wants us to sleep apart
And you are not allowed to enter my room
Ok, well that is really old fashion
Chinese rules
His rules
You sleep here
Don't go upstairs
I am Low Boon Cheng
I wish all my classmates of year 1961
From Seng Yok Primary School
Have a prosperous year and may all your dreams come true!
Ulala!
Low Boon Cheng?
This Mr Sheep Low Cheng Boon ls now known as Low Boon Cheng?
You, stop starring at me
What the hell?
Oh, shit
Thank you, very much
Uncle Chuan, Happy New Year
Uncle Chuan, I heard you let off firecrackers last night
And it was loud
Having a westerner as your son-in-law ls a blessing
Shut up!
Wake up
It's the first day of Chinese New Year, you better get up now
This is for you
Uncle, Happy New Year!
Bee, Happy New Year
Auntie Gao, Happy New Year
Just be frank
I'm concern about you not being busybody
I heard that there was a loud arguement last night
You had a fight with your dad?
Because of your wedding?
You shouldn't fight with him, especially at the reunion dinner
You only have one father in your life
In fact, uncle dotes on you so much
If he really loves me
He wouldn't have left me in England
You wouldn't know
Easier said than done
Your mum died when you're so young
Your dad just started the farm
How could a man
Take care of a 8-year-old kid
I can take care of myself
I don't need him to look after me
Easier said than done
Do you have any idea how hard it is for your dad?
As our Chinese saying
Even if you're not filial enough, at least you obey to your parents
It shouldn't take you so long to wash those veggies
Don't you wash-off the peel of my veggies
It's tastier that way, Uncle
Hey, Benji
Wake up, Benji
Time for breakfast
I don't want to eat, I just want to sleep
No, wake up
Just let me sleep in alright!
Today is the first day of Chinese New year
If you don't get up soon, he is going to be angry again
I'm sorry, did you just say that he will be angry?
Are you having a laugh?
Look, it's been an uphill battle for me, from the minute I arrived
And you cannot say I haven't tried
He wouldn't let me sleep in the room with my fiance
But instead he puts me in here surrounded by photos of dead people
Hey, dead people
Hey, I told you he is a very difficult man
Just try to please him
No, because I don't think that's fair
Why do I have to be the one to compromise?
This man has not even so much as cracked a smile
I'm done, Bee
I just want to leave this archaic, god forsaken place!
You're behaving like a child
No, actually Bee, the only child here is your father
Like I said, I am done
Your father is a closed minded bigot!
And I don't know how to tolerate his conservative backward thinking
How could you say that about my father
Since you hate us traditional people so much
Just don't get married!
Come on, really?
I mean, getting married to you and dealing with the old man
They are two completely different things!
One feels like a no brainer and the other like pushing shit uphill!
So everything is just a joke to you?
I'm a joke, my father is a joke
Marry is a joke
And the baby in my stomachache
Is a joke?
Bee, are you pregnant?
Does it look like I'm joking?
But, how's that possible?
No, look, don't misunderstand me
I'm just enjoying being a couple right now
I don't know if I'm ready to be a father just yet
Stroke?
He was fine yesterday, how did this happen?
Life is so fragile
He normally keeps his own saving's passbook
Somehow he wanted me to take care of it yesterday
And wanted to take me to travel in China
He said that we should travel when we could
Or else we might regret when we can no longer move
He even said that we can't predict the future, especially at this age
Now Zhu is married
As a father, he should be able to leave with no regrets
Where's your son?
He's on his way back from Kuala Lumpur
Almost here
I have to take the call
I want a banquet of at least 50 tables
Not even one less
Bee, what did he say?
Low Cheng Boon
Make sure you got them right, don't leave anyone out
Got it
Choo Chong Meng
Cheong Dong Kin
Fatimah
Lim Kee Huat
I've told you
No, because I've compromised with this banquet dinner
And now are you seriously asking me to handle the wedding invitations?
Father has already sent the invitations to his friends and relatives nearby
We just need to deliver to those who living futher away
Can't you just help?
How far away are we talking?
I mean seriously Bee
You don't find this troublesome or excessive?
I mean what about post?
What about email?
Or what about SMS?
I mean, you are afraid to disagree with him, are you?
It's not about fear.
It is Chinese culture
But it seems to me, you are just giving in to him
Ok, let's say, I'm giving in
I just want his blessing
Alright
You want me to deliver the wedding invitations by hand
Ok, I will do this for you
So likewise, you respect my decision
We take the bike
Stop joking, alright?
I'm dead serious
We take the bike
Are you OK?
Are you OK?
What a bad luck!
The tyre was punctured when we just hit the road
It's very common to get a puncture
How could we get business if you don't ever get puncture
All tyres go flat
Those who are lucky got one after the tread worn out
The unlucky ones might even get one when the tyres still new
Just like human, we might puncture at anytime too
Mr Rabbit Heng, I got a flat tyre here
I'll be late
Turn, turn there
What?
I don't know what are you saying
Hey, what's going on here?
Some kind of street performance?
Mr Ox (Chuan)
Mr Rabbit Heng
Where did you get the flat tyre?
What took you so long?
Just around Simpang Pulai
I'm busy now.
Wait a moment
I've invited all our 12 old classmates
Remember to be there earlier
Of course.
I haven't met them for decades
Sure, sure
Right
Old man, you should go
Otherwise you'll be having gathering in heaven
Evil Fatty
Can't you say something nice
Stop talking something inauspicious during Chinese New Year
Go and bring some cookies for the guests
Why don't you get it yourself?
There's pork jerky, kuih kapit
And drinks at the back.
Don't you have feet?
Uncle, have some cookies
Hey dear
You're pregnant, let me do the work
It's just pregnant, it's not like I can't walk
Thank you
Are you having a boy or a girl?
BOY
Yes, got bird bird one (willy)
Come out next month
Mr Ox, does your son-in-law speak Chinese?
Of course not
He only speaks English
I can never understand
It's even better that he can't speak Chinese
So that you won't fight
Dad, I've added the water
Good, unlike that Fatty of mine
Always annoyed me, I'm speechless
Oh yea, how did you teach your children
He has totally no manners
And I heard he called you old man
It's not so much about manners
Sometimes I'm respected as a senior, but sometimes he has his points too
He's not like what he seems
He's actually quite filial
He said
He will bring me to China on my coming birthday
I told him
We can wait till my 70th birthday
But he said that
Time waits for no one
Are you getting 70 so soon?
I remember you are 6 years younger than me
Nah.
That was Mr Doggie
I'm only 3 years younger than you
Fatty, it's almost time
Go bring out the roasted pig
Got it.
Got it
Let's get a good spot first
Come, this is a good spot
Here dad, this is a good spot
Hubby, come on, come here
Praying to the God of Heaven
Any spot is fine, come on
Please bless us!
I wonder why it rains this year
It's the year of water snake
Water snake, it'll bring us fortune
Look how happy your husband is
So happy
Prosper!
Prosper!
We have a westerner joining us this year
Hot water
Excuse me, give way please
Hey honey, don't simply move around
Come here
Oh yea, you haven't met our old classmates for so long
How are you going to send them the invitations?
That's why I'm meeting the class monitor tomorrow
He surely has all their contacts
Great
Penang is well-known for its prayers to God of Heaven on the 8th day of CNY
A lot of visitors during this period of time
Come again after Chinese New Year
I'll show you around
So whipping the car just now
Are you like a street performer?
No no no, I working god
You work for god
Yes, yes, yes
Ok
So stamp on my back what does it do?
CHOP
Oh chop ya
This one chop
Good you know?
Chinese people said for safe
Tomorrow I make you one, for you
I 'pin' your motor for you
'Pin' is whip
What does it do?
God give power
Very very good luck
Chinese god have very big power
Your boss
Ya, number one number one
I married many years but no baby you know
Last year I pray the "sky gong kau kau" (pray hard to the God of Heaven)
Wah, my wife "dua bat doh"
Pregnant?
Today I buy a
The Pig
Yes, say for thank you
It's very expensive
But for my baby, for my wife
It's all ok
So, what makes you want to be a father?
Baby good
Chinese people said, people feed me, me feed people
One day your son call u "papa"
You'll feel very "syiok" (awesome).
You know?
Ok
Come, to the papas
Cheers
Cheers
Hi
This is the blessing thread from Rambo (Fatty)
He gave it to me when he whipped the bike
It's for safety and for good luck
So I want you to keep it
Take it
It's for good luck.
It's good
All rise, bow
Thank you teacher
Fatimah, you would be the snake
Snake, snake
I don't want to be a snake
I want to be a cat
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, pig
I'm better, I can read it out in backwards order
Pig, dog, rooster, monkey, sheep, horse, snake, dragon, rabbit, tiger, ox, rat
Am I smart?
Mr Black Rooster, since you're so smart
Tell me what's the gender of this tree
Can you tell?
Mr Ox, it's definitely a male
How did you know that?
It's definitely a male, if it's a female
It would have bloomed
Maybe it's a shemale tree
Shemale tree wouldn't bloom as well
True
I think it's a shemale tree as well
Shemale tree
Shemale tree
Mr Doggie.
Look at this photo
You look so dumb
Do you remember before we took this photo
You climbed the shemale tree
The photo has permanently recorded your look with an injured arm
Speaking of which, who can be dumber than the class monitor
Don't you remember?
During the class, he always shouted
"Rise, bow"
"Thank you teacher"
What are you laughing at?
Talking about my past again?
It's all your fault Mr Ox
Kicking my chair for no reason
Serves you right to sleep in class
Here, this is Uncle Ox
Uncle Ox
Uncle Black Rooster
Uncle Black Rooster
Uncle Doggie
Uncle Doggie
Granpa, why are your friends all animals?
You shouldn't be laughing, if not your Fatimah
We could have completed the 12 zodiac
What Fatimah?
Are you crazy?
I'm Chinese, she is Malay
How would I like her
Crazy?
You two were crazier
Trying to make a hot air balloon
Stop talking nonsense.
I'm not mad
I've been trying, I'm almost there
Really?
You are already this old
Yet you're still doing such useless thing
It's not useless
Although we are not young anymore
But we should realise our dream from young
Let's forget about the unhappy stuff
Now let's stop chatting, just go home with me
I have something special to show you
Mr Choo
Thank you
Can these plastic bags turned into a hot air balloon?
You'll know when it takes off
You made it all by yourself
If one day you fly away alone
We would not have known
Do you know how much effort I've put in?
You would understand when I show it to you
Headmaster Choo
Dad
Why are you here?
How could you leave our home empty during Chinese New Year?
Aren't you the one who asked me to come?
It doesn't matter who's order was that
Let's have a meal together during Chinese New Year, just enjoy it
Come on, everyone follow me
Gong Xi Fa Cai
Auntie Choo, Gong Xi Fa Cai
Long time no see
Long time no see
This is the hot air balloon
It looks just like a garbage
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding
Ah Choo, come and take a look
Bee paints really well
Mr Ox, your daughter is a talented artist
See how young Auntie Choo looks in the painting
Really, draw one for me as well
After me
What?
My turn first
She hasn't even painted her dad yet
What are you fighting for?
Mr Ox gets to be painted first
Ah Chuan, come here
Mr Ox, come
Look here
Mr Ox, stop moving around
How can she paint your portrait if you keep moving?
Yea, smile
You look constipated
Mr Ox, here is the contact details of all our old classmates
Don't lose it
I quit
Sit still, why stop?
Look, Bee Yong painted my portrait so well
What's the point?
Is this making money?
It's just like a coffin portrait
Bah!
Touch wood
Don't say such words during Chinese New Year
Let the youngsters be
Let them be?
Come back only when they feel like
Leave whenever they want
Married to a white man as they like
Ah Chuan, Benji is a nice guy
So everyone knew about him
Except me
I'm your dad
Did you even treat me as your daughter?
Send me away as you like and not letting me to bring any of my belongings
Have you ever thought about my feelings?
Hello
Hello
Gong Xi Fa Cai
Filling up petrol shouldn't take you this long
I'm leaving
Sorry
Mr Ox, your contact book
Don't worry
I'll give it to him
Always going your own way
Still going out in this situation
You alright?
I'm waiting no more, let's go
If you insist on going, you gonna have to wear the jacket
Decision made
Are you feeling any warmer?
It's almost full house, only left with one room
Take it if you want, room 20
Go up and go straight to the end
The room is on your left hand side
There are soap and towels in the room
Thank you
Great, it's done, thank you
Hey handsome
Do u want a full body massage?
No, I'm actually pretty sorted
Because I actually just came from Thailand
Let's go.
Where they called me "The Swedish Elbow"
Have a good night
The check out time is tomorrow 12 noon
Be punctual
I'll charge 10 bucks for every hour after that
I'm not kidding
Handsome, we will be here all night
Alright, I'll keep it in mind
Move faster.
Let's go
Coming
Isn't there a better place?
Why did you have to find a place like this
Number 20
What are you doing?
Good night then
Where did he go in the middle of the night?
If I found out that you're do something bad
I will neuter you
If you're doing something that will hurt my daughter
I would not let you go
What?
Turn?
No, just go straight
You looking for level 13?
Please wear the visitor pass
Oh god
My wallet
Mr Sheep
Mr Sheep
May I know if Low Boon Cheng lives here?
Does he live here?
You're looking for the singer Low Boon Cheng?
He normally travels to overseas during Chinese New Year
He won't be back until the Lantern Festival
How could somebody not stay home during Chinese New Year?
This is ridiculous
Can you please pass this invitation to him?
How troublesome!
You can just place it at his doorstep, he will collect it when he gets back
Please hand over to him
Oh dear, so troublesome
Fine, ok
Thank you
I have lost my wallet
Therefore I have no driver's license
That means I cannot ride the motorbike
Do you understand?
What now?
Are you sure you can handle a bike this big?
Hey, you coming?
Ok
Hey is your back any better?
Khor Soon Choy, you still recognize me?
I am Goh Chee Chuan, the one sitting behind the class monitor
Hey, Mr Ox
Aren't you dead?
I thought you were dead?
Where did you hear it from?
I heard from someone, it's good to see you alive
Many people passed away, my wife died long time ago too
So did Ah Lim, the one who likes to play accordion
I heard that he suffered from breast cancer and passed away
Ah Lim suffered from breast cancer?
He passed away so soon?
I was thinking to travel to Perlis to pass him the invitation
Who knows
It's too late
Who's that?
That's my son-in-law
Hi
My name is Benji
I can speak English you know?
I was top in class
I was given an honorary degree in Engineering lam an Engineer, and so is my son
This is your invitation
This is my only daughter
You have to come
HEY
Everything is going to be ok
What happened?
Uncle Khor, it's alright, just calm down
Excuse me, it's now his rest time
What happened to him?
I heard that he is over demanding with his son's school performance
And caused his son to commit suicide
Every time he thinks about his son
Not being able to build his own family and career
He would behave like this
Sorry?
His son took his own life
Khor Soon Choy
Don't forget to attend the dinner
Please open the door
Where the hell has he been, not answering the door
I'm Inspector Rashidi
I'm CID Law Shiau Pyng
We got information that there is prostitution going on here
Please cooperate
I'm just sleeping here
What have I done wrong?
Sir, please show me your IC
Sir, I have not committed any crime
I'm just sleeping here, what did I do?
It's ok, just follow the line
Those are bad guys, just arrest them
Please let me go, I'm old
How am I capable of such thing?
Capable or not, please follow us to the police station
Get in, sir
Please let me go, sir
Shut up
No, I don't want to go
She seems very reluctant to leave
Why don't you let her stay
It's for her own good, just go
I don't want to go
Where were you last night?
It was you who offered me the chicken head, giving me the bad luck
It's embarassing being locked up for the whole night at my age
I don't understand
Cut the crap
Bring me to get some new clothes
I'm going to shower with pomelo leaves, wash away my bad luck
Where's you motorbike?
No mate, we've upgraded, you see
Did you steal someone's car?
No, no, no.
It's ours, I've got the key right here
Where's your motorbike?
No, no, no, motorbike is gone
Sold
So this is going to be more comfortable
Better for your back, not sore
I don't have a car license though
No license, that's fine
Because I've got my license back
I've got my wallet.
Come
Old car is hard to handle
Drive it slowly
Uncle, 15 bucks well-spent, look how handsome you are now
What a bad luck
How could you meet Fatimah wearing this?
Let's go
Uncle, one for him?
Let me show you
This is the trendiest, green colour
I want this
This?
This is even trendier, blue colour
The Hollywood stars wear it too
This is the one
Mr sofa
These kids
Are eavesdropping
Go on, go play at other places!
Sofaman
Sorry about the sofa
It's fine, I mean clearly you both have a very good taste
Chee Chuan
Time flies, it's been 50 years
We're both getting old
You speak Chinese?
Oh yea
We were classmates, your father-in-law and I
He taught me Chinese
And the classmates always make fun and jokes out of two of us
And they said we are a couple
What are you two giggling about?
Sofaman
Alright buddy, Sofaman is coming to get you
I got 6, I win
I win!
Yes!
I haven't spoken in Chinese for a long time
Can't remember a lot of words
Please attend the dinner
Of course, I'll be there
Time flies, we all aged
Now your child is getting married.
You're blessed
Blessed?
You have no idea
Adam, Aman, your dad's calling
Daddy, daddy
What's make them so happy?
Their father's call
Ah, I see
Dad, there's a sofaman at grandma's place today
Dad, when are you coming back
Dad, the sofaman wears the same pattern as our sofa
No matter how they fight, they're still a family
Try to persuade him to celebrate his birthday with the daughter
Because today is their birthday
No, Bee's birthday was ages ago
I know, but according to the traditional Chinese calendar
Today is their birthday
Oh I see.
Ok
What are you talking about?
Nothing
You have to attend, don't forget it
Sure, I sure will
I'll see you at the wedding
Yup, lovely to meet you
Lovely to meet you too, bye
Bye sofaman
Sofaman
Have a safe trip
So today is your birthday yea?
Happy birthday to you
Stop, make a u-turn, let's go home
What?
You wanna go home?
What?
He is heading home to celebrate our birthday?
Well, we are on our way to the Highlands right now
I will try to delay him as much as possible
But you know, you need to get home before he knows about it
Where can I buy dried scallop?
Marine products
We don't have it here, you have to go back to the town
U-turn
Why is the door locked?
Where is Bee?
Bee, Bee is... she has gone to the valley
She just gone to pick up something and she should be right here
Cut the crap, ask her to come back right away
I'll cook her some rice noodle
Oh ya
Absolutely
May I have your attention please.
Ms Goh Bee Yong, Ms Goh Bee Yong
Passenger to Kuala Lumpur, please proceed to boarding gate no.3, thank you
The street light is not working again
What if it causes somebody to fall?
OK
Let's not wait any longer, the noodles have gone soggy, we'll eat first
Aren't you changing your clothes?
You think it's nice?
My Shin?
Yea, I left it on
Look uncle, Bee is not here
She didn't go to the valley at all
She is in Sabah
Waiting to board the plane
Sabah
The plane... in Sabah
Hey sweetheart
I was worried about you.
What happened?
I missed the flight
It's ok
It's ok
You hungry?
Your dad prepared a very special birthday dinner for you
You slept so late, why did you wake up so early?
Trying to be an early bird?
Why did you buy so much?
It's not cheap!
I want to go with you guys.
Wait for me
Have your breakfast before you change
The cassette player doesn't work
Hey look out.
Someone acquired the midas touch
Ah Huat, this is Goh Chee Chuan
Where are you?
Ah Chuan, I'm here, here!
Ah Huat!
Prosper!
Prosper!
(Huat!
Huat!
)
Ah Chuan, I'm walking in the parade
You can meet Lian Pak Cik at the end of the street first
I'll look for you later
Ah Huat!
At the end of the street!
Come on, this is Uncle Ox
Uncle Ox
Well done.
What are your names?
My name is Lian Yong.
They call me Ah Lian
This is my brother, Durian Head
Your doing well, your grandchildren are all grown up
Your're not bad too, you have a white son-in-law
It's over 10pm
Our class monitor that has always been punctual ls late today, how strange
Choo Chong Meng is coming?
Then I better leave
Dad
Mr Ox, did you have a fight with the class monitor again?
The two of you always fought with each other
Yet you are still the closest among all
Still behaving like that even at your age now
Class monitor's call
I'm not taking the call
Don't be a child, take it
I'm not Lian Pak Cik, I'm Ox
Coming or not, it's up to you
Ah Choo passed away this afternoon
Passed away?
Ah Choo, being late with this excuse
This is just not right
You asked me out for coffee the other day
But I missed the appointment
If I knew it was our last meeting
I would have gone
Choo, it was me who took your English textbook
I always wanted to tell you
Now I don't have the chance anymore
Ah Huat, what are you doing?
He used to nodded-off in the class
I always kicked him to wake him up
Then he'll get up and call for rise and bow
This is a forever recess for our class monitor
You sure you're not going in?
Just because there's conflict with the wedding?
At this moment, is there any need for superstitions
You don't get it.
It's for your sake
I don't get it?
It's just a selfish act
Don't pretend to care
If you're not going in, I am going in
Ok, just try to get my head around this one
He was your best mate for 50 years
And you are finding it difficult to go in and say goodbye to him?
Grandma said these sweets are for you
Ok, now this, this is perfect timing mate
You can translate for me yea?
Ok
Spending time with you
I always try my best to follow the Chinese tradition of respecting mu elders
But today I cannot keep quiet
Today, I cannot tolerate anymore
Today I have to speak what is in my head
I have to speak from my head
You've come this far
But you refuse to go in and farewell your friend one last time
I mean I don't understand why you're being so stubborn
You are just a step away yet you refuse to pay your last respect
It seems to me
It seems to me that your ego is getting in the way of a single and final gesture of kindness of honoring the memory of your friend
Now if you don't follow through and say goodbye to him
I can guarantee that you'll regret this for the rest of your life
I mean we are talking about 50 years of friendship, mate, 50 years!
50 years of friendship, 50 years!
That cannot compare to an inflated ego or an archaic sense of pride?
Now if you can accept a life filled with regret
Then just continue standing here
If you like to stand, just stand here as long as you like
Thanks
So, what did you call me for?
I want to make a hot air balloon
What?
Hot air balloon
The balloon?
Aim your target, fix your goal
Aim your target, fix your goal
Make every bit of effort purposeful
Make every bit of effort purposeful
Both of you, come out
So according to the late class monitor's research
A balloon can actually be made from plastic bags
But some of those plastic bags need to be black
So as attract the sun which create a solar effect
Mr Ox, you're doing some useless stuff again?
Exactly!
How can you do these useless stuff
Without the help of the useless old people like us
Yea, how could you not involving us
We need to stick the sheets of plastic together
Now bear in mind, this is not a hot air ballon
It is a solar balloon
We fill the balloon with cold air
Which is then heated by the black plastic enabling lift off
Now we have to trigger a release of cold air mid-flight to bring it back down to earth again
We have safety precautions in place
In the event that the balloon loses control
For example, a safety rope can be released
And secured by people on the ground
In order for the balloon to carry two people
It needs to be 80ft high and 50ft wide
So we will be using more than ten thousand plastic bags
Which is why we need all the help that we can get
Ok, so before take off, I will call
Release the weights
Fly!
Throw the emergency rope
Great job
Well done
It's already late, what are you still doing?
Just doing the final checks
What are you checking?
One check after another?
It would be fine
It this can be flown it's worth it even if I'm dead
I don't understand
The person I worry the most is Bee
You have to take good care of her
Yes, I will be good to Bee
I'm old, and I will 'puncture' one day
If anything happens, I count on you to take care of Bee
'Pongcek' (Puncture)
That's the first word I learnt here
See
Pongcek
I'm sorry, I cannot give you my permission to fly your balloon
Headmaster, we are alumni of this school for 50 years
Can't you cut us some slack?
Ya, it's 50 years, can't you let us in?
Headmaster Chan, do you remember me?
Of course.
You are the wife of the previous headmaster
Your husband was a headmaster as well
You should understand our situation
You have to write a letter to the Ministry of Education
I will call for a meeting once approved by the minister
To discuss about this
Thank you
Is this necessary?
It's just to fly a hot air balloon
We can't bring out the cinerary urn once we place it in the columbarium
Don't worry guys, I have a way to go in
There's a hole at the back, I'm the only one who knows it.
Let's go
Impressive
Stop bragging
Where's the hole?
It's missing
It's even locked
Looks like we have to do it somewhere else
No way
Our class monitor's wish is to rise it at the school
Hey, I've got an idea
Hey, no!
I cannot see anything
The weather is beautiful today
Stop making nonsense
Stand up
Let me give you an example
Malaysia
ls a beautiful country
Got it?
Understand?
Teacher, look over there
What?
Over the basketball court
What's so interesting?
Look at the basketball court
Ok, guys, be really careful
Because it tears off easily
We've got to hurry because the sun is already up
Ok, open it up now
Mr Rooster, we need to find the power source
If you spot a hole, call me!
Is there any hole?
Malaysia is a beautiful country
Don't ruin it you two
It's is safer this way
Chuan, please take good care of Ah Choo
Ready to go?
Ready
Rotate
Ah Choo, I'm flying with you
You ready?
All set
Rise, bow, let's go
Mr Ox, I dare you to go a bit higher
Why not?
Go ahead
Here we go
Buggar
What has happened?
Don't move
Be careful
How did this happen?
Dad
Throw the rope down
Throw down the rope
Where's the rope?
Stop moving
Where's the rope?
Where did you put it?
Throw down the rope
What's wrong with you
Where the hell is the rope
Class monitor!
You alright?
Fine, I'm fine
I'm fine too
It's all your fault, why took us so high
You wanted it as well
Mr Doggie, Mr Ox
You alright, Mr Doggie?
You OK?
Have you been hurt?
Fine, I'm fine
Are you alright?
Try to stay calm, and stay really still
Dad
We're fine
Luckily we're OK
Mr Ox, you're stuck time time
Uncle, your daughter is really good at painting
It looks so real
It's hot, dad
Still laughing at us?
It's all your fault
Thrown down the whole roll of rope
Luckily that safety belt saved us
If not we'll be dead by now
Your white son-in-law bought us fruits too
With all those bought by Auntie Choo yesterday
We can start a fruit stall business
What's better than buying fruit, they can't be buying nasi lemak right?
There are many choices other than fruit
Grandpa
I've told you not to keep coming here
Both of you too, you've been here for so many days
There are many things to prepare for the wedding ceremony
Go home first
How long since you last saw them?
For years, actually
I wrote them a letter recently
Asking if the three of us can make amends
Are they doing well?
They're OK
Each of them is busy with their own lives
I think I would like to invite them to the wedding
I thought you didn't want to see them
It's true
I didn't want to see them
But people change
I mean
Hey, look at me
I can use chopsticks now better than I can use a knife and fork
Something has shifted from me in the past few weeks
I feel like I can appreciate new perspectives
Than I previously understand
Like Chinese culture is not just about tradition
It's something that is inherently born from love
The bond between a children and the parent ls something that can never be broken
When did you learn how to compromise?
Fine, I admit it
I'm willing to compromise, but just this once
Hey wait
Look, see there's a different pair for every stage of the baby's life
When did you buy them?
I bought them when I realized that I was ready
You know, I told you before that I didn't think I was ready to be a father
Now I can't think of anything that I was rather be
Alright, I'm not supposed to be in here
I'm off to bed
Good night
Dad, it looks like you've won
I'm fine, really, I am
Bee, do you want to eat something first?
You won't have time to eat later
No
I won't look good if I eat too much
You have good appetite lately
Look at your big tummy
It's all right, I'll tighten it
You will surely look good
Auntie Gao, can you tighten it a bit more please?
Tighter?
A bit more
You'll feel hard to breath
Uncle Chuan, congratulations
You look handsome today
I have to dress myself up too
Let it protrude
Your health is more important
You know all about it, dad?
Talking about English
I can understand a little too
You're still wearing heels?
Change it please
I feel like a China Doll
China Doll?
You look like a Raggedy Ann!
At least I'm not looking like a Chinese vampire
Vampire?
Who do you think looks better dressed for a Chinese wedding?
Both of you look good
But it'll be even better if you can speak Chinese
Chinese?
Ok, what is "how are you"?
"Ni Hao Ma"
"Ni Hao Ma"
No!
It's "Ni Hao Ma"
"Ni Hao Ma"
Brilliant
Congratulations
Hey old man, you have to say it this way
The marriage of persons
Will be blessed with good fortune and many grandchildren
Thank you, fatty
Dong, are you feeling better?
Way better, just not able to move around freely
Good, look at our Mr Doggie
His hand has been plaster casted for months
You're Uncle Doggie?
If you sought for my blessing before you took off
You'll be perfectly fine even if you fly to Holland
Here comes the wife of class monitor
Why is she here?
It's strictly taboo for Uncle Chuan
I invited them
Isn't this violating the taboo you believed in?
Sometimes it does, but at times it doesn't
No taboo
All right then
Uncle Ox
Good boy
Ah Chuan, congratulations
Are you feeling better?
I'm recovered
Congratulations
Goh Ghee Chuan
Khor Soon Choy
Congratulations
All our classmates are waiting for you
Hello, welcome

It's been such a long time
I know
Benjamin, good to see you
I hope you haven't got a bun in the oven
Well, yes, we'll talk later

"Ma Ni Hao" (Hi mum)
No, just "Ni Hao Ma"
I know
How are you?
How are you?
Very pleased to meet you
Come, we've got years to learn Chinese
Come on, bring the bowl
What's taking Mr Sheep so long?
Mr Sheep?
He's dead
Since when?
It was a long time ago
Mr Sheep?
Skinny Monkey, you just like to fib
All the old classmates are here

He's born on snake year
Finally we've completed the 12 zodiacs
Alright boys and girls
Smile

Cheese
Beautiful
Dad
Your daughter ls getting married today
I thought we may not get a chance
To share any joyful moments anymore
I missed the good old days
These memories were the happiest time of my life
But you never tell us
How much you love me
I still remember
When mum passed away
You held me so tightly but said nothing
Only now
I realized it was you who sent the tuition fee to me when I was in England
Our lives have been lived apart
But the time shared with you, I hold close to my head
Watching you to age every day
Your hair getting greyer day by day
I feel really sad
Dad
Thank you for accepting Benji
And thank you for the love and care you've shown me over the years
So I would like to tell you
Dad
I love you
Ok
I guess now is my turn
And so without further ado to mark this special occasion
I have a surprise for you all
Proper planning, no time wasting
All rise
Bow
Choo Chee Hin!
Come out
Oh yeah, Dad
I forgot to tell you
The shemale tree in our school
Bloomed last week
Congratulations!
Let's hope the bride is not pregnant.
Here I come, my dear!
Come on!
Come on!
Finish the banana then you can bring the bride.
Come on.
Bite it!
Higher!
Bite it!
Getting married on a Chinese New Year's Eve, I've never seen this before.
What's the rush?
Stop asking the obvious question, hypocrite.
Bite it!
Pass it!
Come on, open up!
Ninety eight.....
Two more, two more.
Ninety nine.....
One more, one more, one hundred, one hundred!
The last round, squeeze the milk.
Burst it, burst it, harder, harder.
Hey!
where are you going?
Come on, squeeze it.
Dong, what is all this nonsense?
Your daughter's wedding is embarrassing.
It's just like making a porn movie.
And your son-in-law's hair is just so inappropriate.
I feel sorry for you being a host.
Chuan, don't get angry so easily.
It's easy to get a stroke at our age.
These are typical youngsters.
We are getting old.
Be more open-minded, don't get angry.
Sweet heart, if you are truly a highland girl, then you should be used to these winding roads.
I wasn't born here.
Stand still.
I'm going to puke on you.
No, You're not!
Come here.
Please welcome the bride and groom.
Thank you.
- Fetch the bride with the umbrella.
Blessed by sky, blessed by earth, blessed to be taken care by your new family.
Wish the couple with blessings and good fortune.
Dong, you love your daughter so much.
Why didn't you throw a banquet?
These youngsters have their own thinking.
I'm fine as long as they are happy with it.
The youngsters nowadays don't know the ways of the world.
Don't you know too at this age?
Getting married is a matter of prime.
You should invite all our old classmates.
She thinks it's too troublesome to send out invitations.
Anyway, as long as everyone is happy.
Sending out invitations is troublesome?
If it's my daughter's wedding, I'll send the invitation to any places I can reach.
Is it for real, Uncle Chuan?
Yes, and I will honor my word.
If I fail to do so, I shall be struck by thunder.
I need the toilet really bad!
I have to go.
Let's go!
Benji.
Not that way, this way.
Which way?
This way.
Can you go a little bit faster?
Please, can you just hurry a little bit?
Ok, nearly there.
Benji you dropped my drawing!
Or I'm gonna shit my pants.
Hurry!
Hello?
Hello, Uncle?
- Can u please open the door?
Uncle?
Hello, is there anybody home?
Uncle, please open the door.
He is probably out.
Just hang on for a while.
What you mean he's out?
What are the bloody chances.
Shit!
I told you he is out.
Oh yes!
Go go go!
Hey!
What are you doing?
I've got no time to explain.
No.
If he finds out, he's gonna be pissed off.
Well, he is not going to find out, is he?
Whatever.
Come on.
Just work for me.
Ghost!
Ghost!
Ghost!
Ghost!
Uncle Chuan, there's a ghost at your place!
A ghost?
What ghost?
There's someone prying your door.
You'll be left with nothing if you don't go back now.
I don't know what you are driveling about.
Come on!
Shit!
I'll pry it.
No!
It going to happen.
No!
White man!
Don't move!
White man, don't you move!
Catch him!
Stop him from running away!
Uncle Chuan is here.
Eating too much potatoes must have made you crazy!
You come back all the way from UK with a motorbike?
Who wants potatoes?
I didn't buy it.
Bee, you haven't been back for so long.
I heard that you are back.
Hi, my name is Benji.
Ah Gao.
Uncle, it's early that you pay me.
I don't want to owe money during Chinese New Year.
Oh no, round 2.
Bee, I know you like the scallops.
I've added a lot in it.
Don't act like your father.
He's too stingy to add more even if he likes it.
Smells good.
No!
Bee, what does your boy friend do for a living?
He is a singer in the band.
Stage singer?
He must have earned a lot.
You have to throw a big banquet for your wedding.
Your dad has to save his face.
You have to make it great.
At least 88 tables, am I smart or what?
We are engaged.
We didn't plan to throw a banquet actually.
That's a worry!
Your dad told everyone if he doesn't throw a banquet for his daughter's wedding, he will take the punishment of a thunderstrike.
Ah Gao, are you nuts?
You used-up my scallops.
They're not cheap, you know?
I'll pay you back, ok?
You've not been back for so many years, Yet you humiliated me the moment you got back.
You kidding me?
You offering me the chicken head?
Benji, the chicken head is not for eating.
Oh, buggar, sorry, I didn't realize.
Cut the crap!
Giving me the chicken head on New Year's Eve?
Trying to bring me bad luck this year?
He didn't mean it.
Can you be more reasonable?
Look at you, you can't even speak Chinese properly.
You don't even sound like a Chinese.
Had all the men died out?
Out of all men, you fall in love with a westerner!
You expect me to speak in English?
I wanted to learn Chinese.
It was you who forced me to go to England.
So now I've become English.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I've asked you to come back, but you refused.
And you even continued to study painting!
Painting?
Guess who brought me to learn that at the first place?
It was you!
So now everything I do is just not right in your eyes!
And, getting married is a matter of prime.
Have I been informed?
The reason why I'm back this time.
ls to tell you about my marriage.
Isn't it too late?
Why don't you tell me when I'm dead?
Stop it, I object!
Mr chicken head.
Hey, come on.
Don't let this get you down.
You said yourself your dad was a difficult man.
Just look ahead, sweetheart.
Look to the sparkling sea and the white sand.
We'll find some sweet little secluded beach somewhere.
You can relax.
And finish off your thesis painting.
This here is just a detour.
You come out!
Men and women are not allowed to be in one room.
What did he say?
He wants us to sleep apart.
And you are not allowed to enter my room.
Ok, well that is really old fashion.
Chinese rules.
His rules.
You sleep here.
Don't go upstairs.
I am Low Boon Cheng.
I wish all my classmates of year 1961 from Seng Yok Primary School, have a prosperous year and may all your dreams come true!
Ulala!
Low Boon Cheng?
This Mr Goat Low Cheng Boon.
ls now known as Low Boon Cheng?
You, stop starring at me.
What the hell?
Oh, shit!
Thank you, very much.
Uncle Chuan, Happy New Year.
Uncle Chuan, I heard you let off firecrackers last night.
And it was loud.
Having a westerner as your son-in-law.
ls a blessing.
Shut up!
Wake up.
It's the first day of Chinese New Year, you better get up now.
This is for you.
Uncle, Happy New Year!
Bee, Happy New Year.
Auntie Gao, Happy New Year.
Just be frank.
I'm concern about you not being busybody.
I heard that there was a loud arguement last night.
You had a fight with your dad?
Because of your wedding?
You shouldn't fight with him, especially at the reunion dinner
You only have one father in your life.
In fact, uncle dotes on you so much.
If he really loves me.
He wouldn't have left me in England.
You wouldn't know.
Easier said than done.
Your mum died when you're so young.
Your dad just started the farm.
How could a man..
...take care of a 8-year-old kid.
I can take care of myself.
I don't need him to look after me.
Easier said than done.
Do you have any idea how hard it is for your dad?
As our Chinese saying even if you're not filial enough, at least you obey to your parents.
It shouldn't take you so long to wash those veggies.
Don't you wash-off the peel of my veggies.
It's tastier that way, Uncle.
Hey, Benji.
Wake up, Benji.
Time for breakfast.
I don't want to eat, I just want to sleep!
No, wake up!
Just let me sleep in alright!
Today is the first day of Chinese New year.
If you don't get up soon, he is going to be angry again.
I'm sorry, did you just say that he will be angry?
Are you having a laugh?
Look, it's been an uphill battle for me, from the minute I arrived.
And you cannot say I haven't tried.
He wouldn't let me sleep in the room with my fiance.
But instead he puts me in here surrounded by photos of dead people.
Hey, dead people.
Hey, I told you he is a very difficult man.
Just try to please him.
No, because I don't think that's fair.
Why do I have to be the one to compromise?
This man has not even so much as cracked a smile.
I'm done, Bee.
I just want to leave this archaic, god forsaken place!
You're behaving like a child.
No, actually Bee, the only child here is your father.
Like I said, I am done.
Your father is a closed minded bigot!
And I don't know how to tolerate his conservative backward thinking.
How could you say that about my father.
Since you hate us traditional people so much.
Just don't get married!
Come on, really?
I mean, getting married to you and dealing with the old man.
They are two completely different things!
One feels like a no brainer and the other like pushing shit uphill!
So everything is just a joke to you?
I'm a joke, my father is a joke.
Marry is a joke.
And the baby in my stomachache is a joke?
Bee, are you pregnant?
Does it look like I'm joking?
But, how's that possible?
No, look, don't misunderstand me.
I'm just enjoying being a couple right now.
I don't know if I'm ready to be a father just yet.
Stroke?
He was fine yesterday, how did this happen?
Life is so fragile.
He normally keeps his own saving's passbook.
Somehow he wanted me to take care of it yesterday.
And wanted to take me to travel in China.
He said that we should travel when we could.
Or else we might regret when we can no longer move.
He even said that we can't predict the future, especially at this age.
Now Zhu is married.
As a father, he should be able to leave with no regrets.
Where's your son?
He's on his way back from Kuala Lumpur.
Almost here.
I have to take the call.
I want a banquet of at least 50 tables.
Not even one less.
Bee, what did he say?
Low Cheng Boon.
Make sure you got them right, don't leave anyone out.
Got it.
Choo Chong Meng.
Cheong Dong Kin.
Fatimah.
Lim Kee Huat.
I've told you.
No, because I've compromised with this banquet dinner.
And now are you seriously asking me to handle the wedding invitations?
Father has already sent the invitations to his friends and relatives nearby.
We just need to deliver to those who living futher away.
Can't you just help?
How far away are we talking?
I mean seriously Bee.
You don't find this troublesome or excessive?
I mean what about post?
What about email?
Or what about SMS?
I mean, you are afraid to disagree with him, are you?
It's not about fear.
It is Chinese culture.
But it seems to me, you are just giving in to him.
Ok, let's say, I'm giving in.
I just want his blessing.
Alright.
You want me to deliver the wedding invitations by hand.
Ok, I will do this for you.
So likewise, you respect my decision.
We take the bike.
Stop joking, alright?
I'm dead serious.
We take the bike.
Are you OK?
Are you OK?
What a bad luck!
The tyre was punctured when we just hit the road.
It's very common to get a puncture.
How could we get business if you don't ever get puncture.
All tyres go flat.
Those who are lucky got one after the tread worn out.
The unlucky ones might even get one when the tyres still new.
Just like human, we might "puncture" (die) at anytime too.
Mr Rabbit Heng, I got a flat tyre here.
I'll be late.
Turn, turn there.
What?
I don't know what are you saying.
Hey, what's going on here?
Some kind of street performance?
Mr Ox (Chuan).
Mr Rabbit Heng.
Where did you get the flat tyre?
What took you so long?
Just around Simpang Pulai.
I'm busy now.
Wait a moment.
I've invited all our 12 old classmates.
Remember to be there earlier.
Of course.
I haven't met them for decades.
Sure, sure.
Right.
Old man, you should go.
Otherwise you'll be having gathering in heaven.
Evil Fatty.
Can't you say something nice?
Stop talking something inauspicious during Chinese New Year.
Go and bring some cookies for the guests.
Why don't you get it yourself?
There's pork jerky, kuih kapit.
And drinks at the back.
Don't you have feet?
Uncle, have some cookies.
Hey dear you're pregnant, let me do the work
It's just pregnant, it's not like I can't walk.
Thank you.
Are you having a boy or a girl?
Boy.
Yes, got bird bird one (willy).
Come out next month.
Mr Ox, does your son-in-law speak Chinese?
Of course not.
He only speaks English.
I can never understand.
It's even better that he can't speak Chinese.
So that you won't fight.
Dad, I've added the water.
Good, unlike that Fatty of mine.
Always annoyed me, I'm speechless.
Oh yea, how did you teach your children.
He has totally no manners.
And I heard he called you old man.
It's not so much about manners.
Sometimes I'm respected as a senior, but sometimes he has his points too.
He's not like what he seems.
He's actually quite filial.
He said he will bring me to China on my coming birthday
I told him.
We can wait till my 70th birthday.
But he said that time waits for no one
Are you getting 70 so soon?
I remember you are 6 years younger than me.
Nah.
That was Mr Doggie.
I'm only 3 years younger than you.
Fatty, it's almost time.
Go bring out the roasted pig.
Got it.
Got it.
Let's get a good spot first.
Come, this is a good spot.
Here dad, this is a good spot.
Hubby, come on, come here.
Praying to the God of Heaven.
Any spot is fine, come on.
Please bless us!
I wonder why it rains this year.
It's the year of water snake.
Water snake, it'll bring us fortune.
Look how happy your husband is.
So happy
Prosper!
Prosper!
We have a westerner joining us this year.
Hot water.
Excuse me, give way please.
Hey honey, don't simply move around.
Come here.
Oh yea, you haven't met our old classmates for so long.
How are you going to send them the invitations?
That's why I'm meeting the class monitor tomorrow.
He surely has all their contacts.
Great.
Penang is well-known for its prayers to God of Heaven on the 8th day of CNY.
A lot of visitors during this period of time.
Come again after Chinese New Year.
I'll show you around.
So whipping the car just now.
Are you like a street performer?
No no no, I "working god".
You work for god.
Yes, yes, yes.
Ok.
So stamp on my back what does it do?
Chop.
Oh chop ya.
This one chop.
Good you know?
Chinese people said for safe.
Tomorrow I make you one, for you.
I "pin" your motor for you.
"Pin" is whip.
What does it do?
God give power.
Very very good luck.
Chinese god have very big power.
Your boss.
Ya, number one number one.
I married many years but no baby you know.
Last year I pray the "sky gong kau kau" (pray hard to the God of Heaven).
Wah, my wife "dua bat doh"(pregnant).
Pregnant?
Today I buy The Pig
Yes, say for thank you.
It's very expensive.
But for my baby, for my wife it's all ok.
So, what makes you want to be a father?
Baby good.
Chinese people said, people feed me, me feed people.
One day your son call you "papa".
You'll feel very "syiok" (awesome).
You know?
Ok.
Come, for "papas".
Cheers.
Cheers.
Hi.
This is the blessing thread from Rambo (Fatty).
He gave it to me when he whipped the bike.
It's for safety and for good luck.
So I want you to keep it.
Take it.
It's for good luck.
It's good.
All rise, bow.
Thank you teacher.
Fatimah, you would be the snake.
Snake, snake!
I don't want to be a snake!
I want to be a cat!
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, pig.
I'm better, I can read it out in backwards order.
Pig, dog, rooster, monkey, goat, horse, snake, dragon, rabbit, tiger, ox, rat.
Am I smart?
Mr Black Rooster, since you're so smart.
Tell me what's the gender of this tree.
Can you tell?
Mr Ox, it's definitely a male.
How did you know that?
It's definitely a male, if it's a female.
It would have bloomed.
Maybe it's a shemale tree.
Shemale tree wouldn't bloom as well.
True.
I think it's a shemale tree as well.
Shemale tree.
Shemale tree.
Mr Doggie.
Look at this photo.
You look so dumb.
Do you remember before we took this photo?
You climbed the shemale tree.
The photo has permanently recorded your look with an injured arm.
Speaking of which, who can be dumber than the class monitor?
Don't you remember?
During the class, he always shouted.
"Rise, bow".
"Thank you teacher".
What are you laughing at?
Talking about my past again?
It's all your fault Mr Ox.
Kicking my chair for no reason.
Serves you right to sleep in class.
Here, this is Uncle Ox.
Uncle Ox.
Uncle Black Rooster.
Uncle Black Rooster.
Uncle Doggie.
Uncle Doggie.
Granpa, why are your friends all animals?
You shouldn't be laughing, if not your Fatimah.
We could have completed the 12 zodiac.
What Fatimah?
Are you crazy?
I'm Chinese, she is Malay.
How would I like her?
Crazy?
You two were crazier.
Trying to make a hot air balloon.
Stop talking nonsense, I'm not mad.
I've been trying, I'm almost there.
Really?
You are already this old.
Yet you're still doing such useless thing.
It's not useless.
Although we are not young anymore.
But we should realise our dream from young.
Let's forget about the unhappy stuff.
Now let's stop chatting, just go home with me.
I have something special to show you.
Mr Choo.
Thank you.
Can these plastic bags turned into a hot air balloon?
You'll know when it takes off.
You made it all by yourself.
If one day you fly away alone.
We would not have known.
Do you know how much effort I've put in?
You would understand when I show it to you.
Headmaster Choo.
Dad.
Why are you here?
How could you leave our home empty during Chinese New Year?
Aren't you the one who asked me to come?
It doesn't matter who's order was that
Let's have a meal together during Chinese New Year, just enjoy it.
Come on, everyone follow me.
Gong Xi Fa Cai.
Auntie Choo, Gong Xi Fa Cai.
Long time no see.
Long time no see.
This is the hot air balloon.
It looks just like a garbage.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding.
Ah Choo, come and take a look.
Bee paints really well.
Mr Ox, your daughter is a talented artist.
See how young Auntie Choo looks in the painting.
Really, draw one for me as well.
After me.
What?
My turn first.
She hasn't even painted her dad yet.
What are you fighting for?
Mr Ox gets to be painted first.
Ah Chuan, come here.
Mr Ox, come.
Look here.
Mr Ox, stop moving around.
How can she paint your portrait if you keep moving?
Yea, smile.
You look constipated.
Mr Ox, here is the contact details of all our old classmates.
Don't lose it.
I quit.
Sit still, why stop?
Look, Bee Yong painted my portrait so well.
What's the point?
Is this making money?
It's just like a coffin portrait.
Bah!
Touch wood.
Don't say such words during Chinese New Year.
Let the youngsters be.
Let them be?
Come back only when they feel like.
Leave whenever they want.
Married to a white man as they like.
Ah Chuan, Benji is a nice guy.
So everyone knew about him except me.
I'm your dad!
Did you even treat me as your daughter?
Send me away as you like and not letting me to bring any of my belongings.
Have you ever thought about my feelings?
Hello!
Hello!
Gong Xi Fa Cai!
Filling up petrol shouldn't take you this long.
I'm leaving.
Sorry?
Mr Ox, your contact book.
Don't worry.
I'll give it to him.
Always going your own way.
Still going out in this situation.
You alright?
I'm waiting no more, let's go.
If you insist on going, you gonna have to wear the jacket.
Decision made.
Are you feeling any warmer?
It's almost full house, only left with one room.
Take it if you want, room 20.
Go up and go straight to the end.
The room is on your left hand side.
There are soap and towels in the room.
Thank you.
Great, it's done, thank you.
Hey handsome.
Do you want a full body massage?
No, I'm actually pretty sorted.
Because I actually just came from Thailand.
Let's go.
Where they called me "The Swedish Elbow"
Have a good night.
The check out time is tomorrow 12 noon.
Be punctual.
I'll charge 10 bucks for every hour after that.
I'm not kidding.
Handsome, we will be here all night.
Alright, I'll keep it in mind.
Move faster.
Let's go.
Coming.
Isn't there a better place?
Why did you have to find a place like this.
Number 20.
What are you doing?
Good night then.
Where did he go in the middle of the night?
If I found out that you're do something bad, I will neuter you.
If you're doing something that will hurt my daughter.
I would not let you go.
What?
Turn?
No, just go straight.
You looking for level 13?
Please wear the visitor pass.
Oh god.
My wallet.
Mr Goat.
Mr Goat.
May I know if Low Boon Cheng lives here?
Does he live here?
You're looking for the singer Low Boon Cheng?
He normally travels to overseas during Chinese New Year.
He won't be back until the Lantern Festival.
How could somebody not stay home during Chinese New Year?
This is ridiculous.
Can you please pass this invitation to him?
How troublesome!
You can just place it at his doorstep, he will collect it when he gets back.
Please hand over to him.
Oh dear, so troublesome.
Fine, ok.
Thank you.
I have lost my wallet.
Therefore I have no driver's license.
That means I cannot ride the motorbike.
Do you understand?
What now?
Are you sure you can handle a bike this big?
Hey, you coming?
Ok.
Hey is your back any better?
Khor Soon Choy, you still recognize me?
I am Goh Chee Chuan, the one sitting behind the class monitor.
Hey, Mr Ox.
Aren't you dead?
I thought you were dead?
Where did you hear it from?
I heard from someone, it's good to see you alive.
Many people passed away, my wife died long time ago too.
So did Ah Lim, the one who likes to play accordion.
I heard that he suffered from breast cancer and passed away.
Ah Lim suffered from breast cancer?
He passed away so soon?
I was thinking to travel to Perlis to pass him the invitation.
Who knows.
It's too late.
Who's that?
That's my son-in-law.
Hi.
My name is Benji.
I can speak English you know?
I was top in class.
I was given an honorary degree in Engineering.
I am an Engineer, and so is my son.
This is your invitation.
This is my only daughter.
You have to come.
Hey!
Everything is going to be ok.
What happened?
Uncle Khor, it's alright, just calm down.
Excuse me, it's now his rest time.
What happened to him?
I heard that he is over demanding with his son's school performance.
And caused his son to commit suicide.
Every time he thinks about his son.
Not being able to build his own family and career.
He would behave like this.
Sorry?
His son took his own life.
Khor Soon Choy.
Don't forget to attend the dinner.
Please open the door!
Where the hell has he been, not answering the door.
I'm Inspector Rashidi.
I'm CID Law Shiau Pyng.
We got information that there is prostitution going on here.
Please cooperate.
I'm just sleeping here.
What have I done wrong?
Sir, please show me your IC.
Sir, I have not committed any crime.
I'm just sleeping here, what did I do?
It's ok, just follow the line.
Those are bad guys, just arrest them.
Please let me go, I'm old.
How am I capable of such thing?
Capable or not, please follow us to the police station.
Get in, sir.
Please let me go, sir.
Shut up.
No, I don't want to go!
She seems very reluctant to leave.
Why don't you let her stay.
It's for her own good, just go.
I don't want to go.
Where were you last night?
It was you who offered me the chicken head, giving me the bad luck.
It's embarassing being locked up for the whole night at my age.
I don't understand.
Cut the crap.
Bring me to get some new clothes.
I'm going to shower with pomelo leaves, wash away my bad luck.
Where's you motorbike?
No mate, we've upgraded, you see.
Did you steal someone's car?
No, no, no.
It's ours, I've got the key right here.
Where's your motorbike?
No, no, no, motorbike is gone.
Sold.
So this is going to be more comfortable.
Better for your back, not sore.
I don't have a car license though.
No license, that's fine.
Because I've got my license back.
I've got my wallet.
Come.
Old car is hard to handle.
Drive it slowly.
Uncle, 15 bucks well-spent, look how handsome you are now.
What a bad luck.
How could you meet Fatimah wearing this?
Let's go.
Uncle, one for him?
Let me show you.
This is the trendiest, green colour.
I want this.
This?
This is even trendier, blue colour.
The Hollywood stars wear it too.
This is the one.
Mr sofa.
These kids.
Are eavesdropping.
Go on, go play at other places!
Sofaman!
Sorry about the sofa.
It's fine, I mean clearly you both have a very good taste.
Chee Chuan.
Time flies, it's been 50 years.
We're both getting old.
You speak Chinese?
Oh yeah.
We were classmates, your father-in-law and I.
He taught me Chinese.
And the classmates always make fun and jokes out of two of us.
And they said we are a couple.
What are you two giggling about?
Sofaman.
Alright buddy, Sofaman is coming to get you.
I got 6, I win!
I win!
Yes!
I haven't spoken in Chinese for a long time.
Can't remember a lot of words.
Please attend the dinner.
Of course, I'll be there.
Time flies, we all aged.
Now your child is getting married.
You're blessed.
Blessed?
You have no idea.
Adam, Aman, your dad's calling.
Daddy, daddy.
What's make them so happy?
Their father's call.
Ah, I see.
Dad, there's a sofaman at grandma's place today.
Dad, when are you coming back?
Dad, the sofaman wears the same pattern as our sofa.
No matter how they fight, they're still a family.
Try to persuade him to celebrate his birthday with the daughter.
Because today is their birthday.
No, Bee's birthday was ages ago.
I know, but according to the traditional Chinese calendar.
Today is their birthday.
Oh I see.
Ok.
What are you talking about?
Nothing.
You have to attend, don't forget it.
Sure, I sure will.
I'll see you at the wedding.
Yup, lovely to meet you.
Lovely to meet you too, bye.
Bye sofaman.
Sofaman!
Have a safe trip.
So today is your birthday?
Happy birthday to you!
Stop, make a u-turn, let's go home.
What?
You want to go home?
What?
He is heading home to celebrate our birthday?
Well, we are on our way to the Highlands right now.
I will try to delay him as much as possible.
But you know, you need to get home before he knows about it.
Where can I buy dried scallop?
Marine products.
We don't have it here, you have to go back to the town.
U-turn.
Why is the door locked?
Where is Bee?
Bee, Bee is... she has gone to the valley.
She just gone to pick up something and she should be right here.
Cut the crap, ask her to come back right away.
I'll cook her some rice noodle.
Oh yeah.
Absolutely.
May I have your attention please.
Ms Goh Bee Yong, Ms Goh Bee Yong.
Passenger to Kuala Lumpur, please proceed to boarding gate no.3, thank you.
The street light is not working again.
What if it causes somebody to fall?
OK.
Let's not wait any longer, the noodles have gone soggy, we'll eat first.
Aren't you changing your clothes?
You think it's nice?
My Shirt?
Yea, I left it on.
Look uncle, Bee is not here.
She didn't go to the valley at all.
She is in Sabah.
Waiting to board the plane.
Sabah.
The plane... in Sabah.
Hey sweetheart.
I was worried about you.
What happened?
I missed the flight.
It's ok.
It's ok.
You hungry?
Your dad prepared a very special birthday dinner for you.
You slept so late, why did you wake up so early?
Trying to be an early bird?
Why did you buy so much?
It's not cheap!
I want to go with you guys.
Wait for me.
Have your breakfast before you change.
The cassette player doesn't work.
Hey look out.
Someone acquired the midas touch.
Ah Huat, this is Goh Chee Chuan.
Where are you?
Ah Chuan, I'm here, here!
Ah Huat!
Prosper!
Prosper!
(Huat!
Huat!
)
Ah Chuan, I'm walking in the parade.
You can meet Lian Pak Cik at the end of the street first.
I'll look for you later.
Ah Huat!
At the end of the street!
Come on, this is Uncle Ox.
Uncle Ox.
Well done.
What are your names?
My name is Lian Yong.
They call me Ah Lian.
This is my brother, Durian Head.
Your doing well, your grandchildren are all grown up.
Your're not bad too, you have a Westerner son-in-law.
It's over 10 o'clock.
Our class monitor that has always been punctual.
ls late today, how strange!
Choo Chong Meng is coming?
Then I better leave.
Dad.
Mr Ox, did you have a fight with the class monitor again?
The two of you always fought with each other.
Yet you are still the closest among all.
Still behaving like that even at your age now.
Class monitor's call.
I'm not taking the call.
Don't be a child, take it.
I'm not Lian Pak Cik, I'm Ox.
Coming or not, it's up to you.
Ah Choo passed away this afternoon.
Passed away?
Ah Choo, being late with this excuse.
This is just not right.
You asked me out for coffee the other day.
But I missed the appointment.
If I knew it was our last meeting.
I would have gone.
Choo, it was me who took your English textbook.
I always wanted to tell you.
Now I don't have the chance anymore.
Ah Huat, what are you doing?
He used to nodded-off in the class.
I always kicked him to wake him up.
Then he'll get up and call for rise and bow.
This is a forever recess for our class monitor.
You sure you're not going in?
Just because there's conflict with the wedding?
At this moment, is there any need for superstitions?
You don't get it.
It's for your sake.
I don't get it?
It's just a selfish act.
Don't pretend to care.
If you're not going in, I am going in.
Ok, just try to get my head around this one.
He was your best mate for 50 years.
And you are finding it difficult to go in and say goodbye to him?
Grandma said these sweets are for you.
Ok, now this, this is perfect timing, mate.
You can translate for me?
Ok.
Spending time with you.
I always try my best to follow the Chinese tradition of respecting my elders.
But today I cannot keep quiet.
Today, I cannot tolerate anymore!
Today I have to speak what is in my heart.
I have to speak from my head.
You've come this far.
But you refuse to go in and farewell your friend one last time.
I mean I don't understand why you're being so stubborn.
You are just a step away yet you refuse to pay your last respect.
It seems to me...
It seems to me that your ego is getting in the way of a single and final gesture.
of kindness of honoring the memory of your friend.
Now if you don't follow through and say goodbye to him.
I can guarantee that you'll regret this for the rest of your life.
I mean we are talking about 50 years of friendship, mate, 50 years!
50 years of friendship, 50 years!
That cannot compare to an inflated ego or an archaic sense of pride?
Now if you can accept a life filled with regret.
Then just continue standing here.
If you like to stand, just stand here as long as you like.
Thanks.
So, what did you call me for?
I want to make a hot air balloon.
What?
Hot air balloon.
Hot air balloon?
The balloon?
Aim your target, fix your goal.
Aim your target, fix your goal.
Make every bit of effort purposeful.
Make every bit of effort purposeful.
Both of you, come out.
So according to the late class monitor's research, a balloon can actually be made from plastic bags.
But some of those plastic bags need to be black.
So as attract the sun which create a solar effect.
Mr Ox, you're doing some useless stuff again?
Exactly!
How can you do these useless stuff.
Without the help of the useless old people like us.
Yea, how could you not involving us.
We need to stick the sheets of plastic together.
Now bear in mind, this is not a hot air ballon.
It is a solar balloon.
We fill the balloon with cold air.
Which is then heated by the black plastic enabling lift off.
Now we have to trigger a release of cold air mid-flight.
to bring it back down to earth again.
We have safety precautions in place.
In the event that the balloon loses control.
For example, a safety rope can be released.
And secured by people on the ground.
In order for the balloon to carry two people, it needs to be 80ft high and 50ft wide.
So we will be using more than ten thousand plastic bags.
Which is why we need all the help that we can get.
Ok, so before take off, I will call release the weights.
Fly!
Throw the emergency rope.
Great job.
Well done!
It's already late, what are you still doing?
Just doing the final checks.
What are you checking?
One check after another?
It would be fine.
It this can be flown, it's worth it even if I'm dead.
I don't understand.
The person I worry the most is Bee.
You have to take good care of her.
Yes, I will be good to Bee.
I'm old, and I will "puncture"(die) one day.
If anything happens, I count on you to take care of Bee.
"Pongcek" (Puncture).
That's the first word I learnt here.
See.
Pongcek.
I'm sorry, I cannot give you my permission to fly your balloon.
Headmaster, we are alumni of this school for 50 years.
Can't you cut us some slack?
Ya, it's 50 years, can't you let us in?
Headmaster Chan, do you remember me?
Of course.
You are the wife of the previous headmaster.
Your husband was a headmaster as well.
You should understand our situation.
You have to write a letter to the Ministry of Education.
I will call for a meeting once approved by the minister.
To discuss about this.
Thank you.
Is this necessary?
It's just to fly a hot air balloon.
We can't bring out the cinerary urn once we place it in the columbarium.
Don't worry guys, I have a way to go in.
There's a hole at the back, I'm the only one who knows it.
Let's go.
Impressive.
Stop bragging.
Where's the hole?
It's missing.
It's even locked.
Looks like we have to do it somewhere else.
No way.
Our class monitor's wish is to rise it at the school.
Hey, I've got an idea.
Hey, no!
I cannot see anything.
The weather is beautiful today.
Stop making nonsense.
Stand up.
Let me give you an example.
Malaysia is a beautiful country.
Got it?
Understand?
Teacher, look over there.
What?
Over the basketball court.
What's so interesting?
Look at the basketball court.
Ok, guys, be really careful.
Because it tears off easily.
We've got to hurry because the sun is already up.
Ok, open it up now.
Mr Rooster, we need to find the power source.
If you spot a hole, call me!
Is there any hole?
Malaysia is a beautiful country.
Don't ruin it you two!
It's is safer this way.
Chuan, please take good care of Ah Choo.
Ready to go?
Ready!
Rotate.
Ah Choo, I'm flying with you.
You ready?
All set.
Rise, bow, let's go.
Mr Ox, I dare you to go a bit higher.
Why not?
Go ahead.
Here we go.
Bugger.
What has happened?
Don't move.
Be careful.
How did this happen?
Dad!
Throw the rope down!
Throw down the rope!
Where's the rope?
Stop moving!
Where's the rope?
Where did you put it?
Throw down the rope!
What's wrong with you.
Where the hell is the rope?
Class monitor!
You alright?
Fine, I'm fine.
I'm fine too.
It's all your fault, why took us so high?
You wanted it as well right?
Mr Doggie, Mr Ox!
You alright, Mr Doggie?
You OK?
Have you been hurt?
Fine, I'm fine.
Are you alright?
Try to stay calm, and stay really still.
Dad!
We're fine, right?
Luckily we're OK.
Mr Ox, you're stuck time time.
Uncle, your daughter is really good at painting.
It looks so real.
It's hot, dad.
Still laughing at us?
It's all your fault.
Thrown down the whole roll of rope.
Luckily that safety belt saved us.
If not we'll be dead by now.
Your white son-in-law bought us fruits too.
With all those bought by Auntie Choo yesterday.
We can start a fruit stall business.
What's better than buying fruit, they can't be buying nasi lemak right?
There are many choices other than fruit.
Grandpa.
- Grandpa.
I've told you not to keep coming here.
Both of you too, you've been here for so many days.
There are many things to prepare for the wedding ceremony.
Go home first.
How long since you last saw them?
For years, actually.
I did write them a letter recently.
Asking if the three of us can make amends.
Are they doing well?
They're OK.
Each of them is busy with their own lives.
I think I would like to invite them to the wedding.
I thought you didn't want to see them.
It's true.
I didn't want to see them.
But people change.
I mean.
Hey, look at me.
I can use chopsticks now better than I can use a knife and fork.
I don't know, Something has shifted from me in the past few weeks.
I feel like I can appreciate new perspectives.
Than I previously understand.
Like Chinese culture is not just about tradition.
It's something that is inherently born from love.
The bond between a children and the parent, is something that can never be broken.
When did you learn how to compromise?
Ok fine, I admit it.
I'm willing to compromise, but just this once.
Hey wait.
Look, see there's a different pair for every stage of the baby's life.
When did you buy them?
I bought them when I realized that I was ready.
You know, I told you before that I didn't think I was ready to be a father.
Now I can't think of anything that I was rather be.
Alright, I'm not supposed to be in here.
I'm off to bed.
Good night.
Dad, it looks like you've won.
I'm fine, really, I am.
Bee, do you want to eat something first?
You won't have time to eat later.
No.
I won't look good if I eat too much.
You have good appetite lately.
Look at your big tummy.
It's all right, I'll tighten it.
You will surely look good.
Auntie Gao, can you tighten it a bit more please?
Tighter?
- A bit more.
You'll feel hard to breath.
Uncle Chuan, congratulations!
You look handsome today.
I have to dress myself up too.
Let it protrude.
Your health is more important.
You know all about it, dad?
Talking about English.
I can understand a little too
You're still wearing heels?
Change it please.
I feel like a China Doll.
China Doll?
You look like a Raggedy Ann!
At least I'm not looking like a Chinese vampire.
Vampire?
Who do you think looks better dressed for a Chinese wedding?
Both of you look good.
But it'll be even better if you can speak Chinese.
Chinese?
Ok, what is "how are you"?
"Ni Hao Ma".
"Ni Hao Ma".
No!
It's "Ni Hao Ma".
"Ni Hao Ma".
Brilliant.
Congratulations!
Hey old man, you have to say it this way.
The marriage of persons will be blessed with good fortune and many grandchildren.
Thank you, fatty.
Dong, are you feeling better?
Way better, just not able to move around freely.
Good, look at our Mr Doggie.
His hand has been plaster casted for months.
You're Uncle Doggie?
If you sought for my blessing before you took off.
You'll be perfectly fine even if you fly to Holland.
Here comes the wife of class monitor.
Why is she here?
It's strictly taboo for Uncle Chuan.
I invited them.
Isn't this violating the taboo you believed in?
Sometimes it does, but at times it doesn't.
No taboo.
All right then.
Uncle Ox.
Good boy.
Ah Chuan, congratulations!
Are you feeling better?
I'm recovered.
Congratulations.
Goh Ghee Chuan.
Khor Soon Choy.
Congratulations!
All our classmates are waiting for you.
Hello, welcome.
I speak English, you know?
Yes, I remember.
Congratulations.
Thank you, welcome.
Skinny monkey, it's been decades we haven't met.
Long time no see.
Long time no see.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Mr Ox, here comes your Fatimah.
You idiot!
Hello, Fatimah.
Congratulations!
You look handsome today.
You look pretty too.
Come on.
Jenny, today is not about our past.
ls about our son.
Agreed.
Can't we get along, just for his sake?
But only just for today.
Ok.
Look at you two.
This was your idea, wasn't it?
My darling, I'm so so happy to see you.
It's been such a long time.
I know.
Benjamin, good to see you.
I hope you haven't got a bun in the oven.
Well, yes, we'll talk later.
This is my father-in-law.
Mother and father.
"Ni Ma Hao" (Your mum's ok?
)
"Ma Ni Hao" (Hi mum).
No, just "Ni Hao Ma"?
I know.
How are you?
How are you?
Very pleased to meet you.
Come, we've got years to learn Chinese.
Come on, bring the bowl.
What's taking Mr Goat so long?
Mr Goat?
He's dead......
Since when?
- It was a long time ago.
Hello, everebody!
I'm here.

Skinny Monkey, you just like to fib.
All the old classmates are here.
Please come up to the stage and take a group photo.
Ok, I'll call the roll.

Horse.
Goat.
Monkey.
Rooster.
Dog.
Pig.
Where's the pig?
The pig is your grandpa.
You look just like him when he was young.
Come on, you sit here.
Take your grandpa's seat.
Who's gonna take the class teacher's seat?
Ben, come.
He's born on snake year.
Finally we've completed the 12 zodiac.
Alright boys and girls.
Smile.
One.
Two.
Cheese!
Beautiful!
Dad.
Your daughter is getting married today I thought we may not get a chance to share any joyful moments anymore I missed the good old days.
These memories were the happiest time of my life.
But you never tell us..
..how much you love me.
I still remember, when mum passed away, you held me so tightly but said nothing.
Only now I realized it was you who sent the tuition fee to me when I was in England.
Our lives have been lived apart.
But the time shared with you, I hold close to my head.
Watching you to age every day your hair getting greyer day by day.
I feel really sad...
Dad, thank you for accepting Benji.
And thank you for the love and care you've shown me over the years.
So I would like to tell you dad I love you.
Ok.
I guess now is my turn.
And so without further ado to mark this special occasion.
I have a surprise for you all.
Proper planning, no time wasting.
All rise!
Bow.
Choo Chee Hin!
Come out!
Oh yea, Dad.
I forgot to tell you.
The shemale tree in our school.
Bloomed last week.
NARRATOR:
Every action is being monitored.
MARK DICE:
There are millions and millions of cameras everywhere you go.
NARRATOR:
Every conversation is recorded.
SAMY KAMKAR:
Cell phones are actually sending information about who we're communicating with on a daily basis.
NARRATOR:
And every secret is exposed.
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
We are headed into this direction where, with a stroke of a key, you can figure out anything you want about a person.
NARRATOR:
As technology advances, information about everything... and everyone... is becoming more accessible than ever before.
But in this age of unlimited access, should we be asking not only who is watching us, but from where?
DAVID CHILDRESS:
These Watchers, who are extraterrestrials, were all over the Earth in ancient times.
Watching people on Earth, watching civilization grow, and you have to wonder... isn't this still happening today?
NARRATOR:
Millions of people around the world believe we have been visited in the past by extraterrestrial beings.
What if it were true?
Did ancient aliens really help to shape our history?
And if so, might they be among us today?
NARRATOR:
June 5, 2013.
The British daily newspaper The Guardian reveals that classified documents from the United States National Security Agency have been leaked.
Among them is an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court requiring Verizon to hand over metadata from millions of Americans' phone calls to the FBI and NSA.
Four days later,
Edward Snowden, a former cyber security expert for the Central Intelligence Agency, comes forward to identify himself as the source of the leak.
When asked to explain his actions,
Snowden states, "I can get your e-mails, passwords, phone records, credit cards.
I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded."
DICE:
The NSA is the National Security Agency or, as some people call it, the National Spying Agency, which is in control of monitoring the communication systems throughout the world... every form of electronic communication, supposedly for the purposes of national security
to identify and neutralize any threats to America.
One of the documents that Edward Snowden released was about a Project Mystic, which has the capability to record the actual audio of every conversation in an entire country, if not the planet.
KAMKAR:
Technology is really interesting, as it enhances our life in so many ways.
But with each of those enhancements, there's also something potentially taken away, depending on how you see it.
For example, our privacy is changing or is, uh, actually getting reduced almost daily.
DICE:
We've never experienced a society where there are so many microphones, millions and millions of cameras everywhere you go.
TSOUKALOS:
We are moving our entire lives into what is known as the Cloud.
We are headed into this direction where, with a stroke of a key, you can figure out anything you want about a person.
NARRATOR:
As technology continues to advance at an ever-increasing rate, we gain greater access to information both from and about each other, becoming interconnected unlike any other time in our history.
There are those who believe that this evolution of technology is not entirely of our own making, but that we have been guided by visitors that first came to Earth thousands of years ago.
TSOUKALOS:
From the perspective that I look at it all is that a long time ago, extraterrestrials provided the basic tools, the basic knowledge with the idea that ultimately we would turn or become the society that we are today.
So is it possible that we are still being observed?
And the answer is a resounding yes.
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists contend that it is by extraterrestrial design that we have become so technologically interconnected, and that we are being watched not only by agencies of the government, but by beings from beyond our world.
They also claim that they set us on this course in the ancient past, and that we can find evidence of their existence in the stories of a group of ancient aliens known as the Watchers.
In the fourth chapter of the Hebrew Bible's Book of Daniel, the Watchers are described as a group of divine overseers, later associated with angels.
ROBERT CARGILL:
The Watchers are essentially messengers.
And so this is why many scholars understand the Watchers to be a class of angels, since angels were understood to be messengers in the Bible.
They're tasked with managing the Earth and watching over humans.
And some of these are said to be good Watchers.
They do their jobs dutifully.
And others are said to be bad Watchers.
ARIEL BAR TZADOK:
It is said about the Watchers that nothing happens on Earth that is not ordained by their hand and executed by their agents.
Who are they?
What are they?
Well,
Daniel doesn't necessarily go into greater detail.
But there were numerous other texts that teach more about that which is recorded in the Biblical books.
One of the most famous, of course, is the Book of Enoch.
NARRATOR:
The Book of Enoch, containing the firsthand account of the great-grandfather of Noah, was stricken from the Bible's Old Testament at the Council of Laodicea in the 4th century AD.
In the third book of this apocryphal text,
Enoch says an angel...
known as a "Watcher"... took him aboard a fiery chariot that ascended to Heaven.
DAVID WILCOCK:
Enoch is brought up into outer space, into "Heaven."
It's fascinatingly detailed, and the reports of crystal walls with light coming out of them and crystal rooms sounds like someone with primitive language skills trying to explain going into a super-high-fidelity science-fiction reality.
CHILDRESS:
In many ways, when you read the Book of Enoch, he is an abductee by extraterrestrials and they're taking him into a spaceship, they're showing him the Earth, they're giving him special instructions.
NARRATOR:
The Book Of Enoch also states that 200 Watchers descended to Earth to oversee humankind and aid in our advancement.
ANDREW COLLINS:
The Watchers were said to have taught mankind many different arts and sciences that had previously only been known to the "angels" of Heaven.
And these included astronomy, metrology, the use of weapons.
TSOUKALOS:
Enoch is talking about flesh-and-blood beings who came, saw potential for mankind and imparted knowledge.
Those are who the Watchers were.
NARRATOR:
Could it be that the Watchers described in the Book of Enoch are extraterrestrials that came to Earth and taught early humans in the distant past?
Did they plant the seeds of knowledge that would lead us to this point in our technological evolution?
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes, and suggest that evidence for this can be found in every corner of the world.
WILLIAM HENRY:
Around the world, we find stories that are strikingly similar to that of the Watchers coming to Earth and giving humanity forbidden knowledge, especially the secrets of Heaven.
NARRATOR:
Inca legend states that the god Viracocha created humans and taught them astronomy, agriculture and other advanced arts.
The Maya civilization believed their supreme god Kukulkan taught humans writing, mathematics and science.
And in ancient Chinese legend, the divine ruler Huang Di introduced numerous advancements such as the wheel, weaving and writing.
COLLINS:
In Egypt, you have the god Osiris revealing the wisdom to mortal kind on how they could construct civilization.
And you find this again and again, um, within the... the Eurasian continent, in Africa, but also obviously within Southwest Asia.
You have the stories of the Anunnaki.
TSOUKALOS:
Stories of the Anunnaki or the Watchers or the... the gods in the Greek pantheon or any of the ancient gods were based on physical visitations.
ERICH VON DANIKEN:
They are all the same group, the same extraterrestrials.
They just have received different names a mong the tribes and among the continents.
NARRATOR:
If extraterrestrials really did come here to Earth to assist humanity, what happened to them?
Perhaps the answer can be found with one of the ancient world's most powerful secret societies, which still exists today.
NARRATOR:
The Netherlands.
March 24, 2014.
58 world leaders gather at the World Forum in The Hague for the third biannual Nuclear Security Summit.
In the center of the room is a giant spinning hologram of a pyramid with three smaller upside-down pyramids inside it.
This symbol, which is also worn as a pin by the delegates, is the summit's official logo.
But there are some who claim it represents something else, the all-seeing eye of the Illuminati.
Conspiracy theorists suggest that this centuries-old secret society is alive and well in the 21st century, as evidenced by symbols flashed by celebrities, industry moguls and even heads of state.
DICE:
The modern-day Illuminati was organized by Adam Weishaupt in Germany.
He formulated plans so that his group could infiltrate all the key powers of society, the political sphere, the banking sphere, the media sphere back in the late 1700s.
When we're talking about the Illuminati today, we're talking about, essentially, the most powerful secret society.
These are the people that pull the strings from behind the scenes.
NARRATOR:
Is this just paranoia, or might the Illuminati still be around today, embedded in the highest levels of society?
And if so, what is their agenda?
Some say the answer can be found with a much older secret society, which may have been the precursor to the Illuminati, the Knights Templar.
This band of warrior monks was formed in 1118 AD to protect pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem during the Crusades.
But many claim that their true purpose was to find lost religious relics hidden at the Temple Mount.
And during their time in Jerusalem, they rose from relative obscurity to being the most powerful order of the Crusades.
So far-reaching was their influence that it became widely rumored they were in league with demons.
JONATHAN YOUNG:
Jacques de Molay, the leading figure in the history of the Knights Templar, was brought up on charges of treason and heresy for something like devil worship, somehow worshipping the dark side.
And this was the charge brought against not only de Molay but the Knights Templars in general.
NARRAR:
Iit possible the Knights Templar really were in contact with otherworldly entities they encountered at the Temple Mount?
And if so, just what were these so-called demons?
BAR TZADOK:
We are taught that these shedim, demons, in many ways, they are like human beings.
And in many ways, they're like the angels.
Some are evil.
Many are good.
Rumor has it that the Templar Knights endeavored to communicate with these spiritual entities.
KATHLEEN McGOWAN COPPENS:
This concept of demons is very different from the way we think of demons today.
Essentially what a demon was, was an otherworldly being, a being that was not of this Earth, potentially an extraterrestrial being, with the word "extraterrestrial" meaning "not of this Earth."
NARRATOR:
Could the Templars really have been influenced by aliens that they misinterpreted as spiritual beings?
Some ancient astronaut theorists say that the Knights Templar were in contact with the same extraterrestrials that were known in biblical times as the Watchers.
And as evidence, they point to one of the Templars' most prominent symbols, the same symbol that some say was virtually present at the Nuclear Security Summit:
the all-seeing eye.
This symbol... which is sometimes just an eye, but often an eye within a pyramid... was used by the ancient Egyptians, the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians, the Freemasons, the Illuminati, and is even incorporated into the great seal of the United States.
It is a symbol that is most commonly interpreted to mean that someone, or something, is watching us.
WILCOCK:
The Eye of Providence symbolizes the idea of an omniscient, intelligent universe that is overseeing all of the affairs that we have here on Earth.
JASON MARTELL:
For many, the Eye of Providence was a symbol that God was watching over us, but others believed that it had a much deeper meaning and actually extended well beyond many other cultures... possibly even connected to extraterrestrials.
NARRATOR:
Could the symbol of the all-seeing eye be secretly telling us that the Watchers are still here on Earth, working behind the scenes in secret societies and even the top levels of government?
Curiously, the Book of Enoch tells of the Watchers' arrival, but it never tells of their departure.
BAR TZADOK:
We have the records, as described in the Book of Enoch and other literature, that when the Watchers came down, corrupted the human gene pool.
Introducing hidden technologies, centuries before they were meant to be introduced.
Things were off track.
It was then ordained by whatever heavenly powers that we had to start from scratch.
A flood was to come.
But yet, what happened to the Watchers?
They were not human, and therefore they were not subject to a human decree.
Or could they be susceptible to human death?
Well, the Bible doesn't say what happened to them.
But the other legends do.
In the mystical legends, it is taught that a good number of them escaped the flood by escaping to secret hidden places.
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that ancient aliens called the Watchers actually survived the cataclysm known as the Great Flood?
And could they not only have survived, but managed to live among us in secret for thousands of years?
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes, and claim that proof can be found deep beneath the Earth.
NARRATOR:
Nevsehir Province, Central Turkey.
Hidden 60 meters belowground lies Derinkuyu, an ancient subterranean city that archaeologists believe once housed more than 20,000 people.
First discovered in 1963, some ancient astronaut theorists contend the once fully-functioning underground city is evidence that ancient people really were forced underground by a great cataclysmic event... (thunder crashing) (wind howling) ...and that they may have had help from more advanced beings,
like the Watchers.
HENRY:
The amazing thing about Derinkuyu is that it was built around 9000 BC, just before the last Ice Age.
And you have to ask, is it possible that it was built by the Watchers as a refuge for themselves, or perhaps as a refuge for humanity?
CHILDRESS:
Archaeologists in the Middle East have surmised that around 5000 BC, there was a huge flood throughout the Middle East,
and it destroyed and flooded much of Sumeria and Anatolia.
This is the same time where the city of Derinkuyu was being occupied underground.
So, we might surmise that this was one of the refuges of the Watchers.
NARRATOR:
Is it really possible that the underground city of Derinkuyu was constructed with the help of extraterrestrials to provide shelter from a great flood?
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest that Derinkuyu is just one of numerous locations where it appears someone or something built a fortification to serve as a refuge from a great cataclysm.
In a remote area of the Himalayan mountain range in Nepal, at an elevation of 14,000 feet, over 10,000 manmade caves have been found carved into sheer cliffs.
Archaeologists believe they could date back more than 3,000 years, and struggle to explain how ancient people would have been able to access these caves, let alone create them.
WILCOCK:
It's not easy to get up there at all.
It's not known, why would people take the trouble to climb up a vertical cliff in the middle of the Himalayas?
It suggests that whoever built them might have had some sort of flying craft technology.
NARRATOR:
Perhaps even more baffling are the Huashan Grottos in the Anhui Province of China.
They are the largest ancient manmade caves in the country, containing stone rooms, bridges and pavilions.
Archaeologists have no idea how they were built, by whom or why.
Could these ancient sites that defy explanation have been built by alien visitors in order to survive the Great Flood?
Ancient astronaut theorists contend that perhaps the strongest proof that the Watchers survived the flood can be found not in the Middle East,
Asia or India, but in the American Southwest.
Northeastern Arizona.
Sprawled across this desolate and arid region lie the three mesas... settlements of the Native American Hopi tribe that some have long believed align with the stars of Orion's Belt...
Alnilam, Alnitak and Mintaka.
In addition to their strong ties to the constellation of Orion, the Hopi also have numerous legends of the Ant People, an advanced race of beings that came to the aid of mankind.
GARY A. DAVID:
I've seen some of these carvings on the rock cliffs in Arizona.
The Ant People helped the Hopi survive two major cataclysms:
the destruction of the first world by fire...
- some kind of asteroid strike...
- (explosive rumbling) ...and the second world by ice, maybe a pole shift.
But each time, the Ant People led the Hopi down into caverns and helped them survive in a subterranean world.
HENRY:
This story is strikingly similar to that of the Watchers, who sought to protect the humans that they had interacted with.
You have to wonder... are the Ant People somehow related to, if not the same as, the Watchers of the biblical story?
NARRATOR:
But what ancient astronaut theorists find most fascinating about the story of the Ant People is what they are called in Hopi.
DAVID:
The Hopi word for "ant" is "anu,"
and the Hopi word for "friend" is "nnaki."
So, you put the two together, the Anunnaki, the ant friend that the Hopi have interacted with for centuries and millennia.
And this ties in with the Bible and with Sumerian mythology.
It's all tied in together.
These Ant People are pervasive in human history.
NARRATOR:
According to Sumerian texts, the Anunnaki, much like the Watchers, were beings who came down from the sky, and helped mankind's earliest civilization to develop writing, medicine and irrigation.
Could the Hopi stories of the Ant People actually be describing the same star travelers that the Sumerians called the Anunnaki,
and that the Bible refers to as the Watchers?
Might the Ant People have been extraterrestrials that took refuge in the caves of the American Southwest
to survive the Great Flood?
But if the Watchers really did remain here on Earth, did they also continue to manipulate the evolution of human society?
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes, and claim the evidence can be found with the strange cave-dwelling entities known as the Jinn.
NARRATOR:
Muscat, Oman.
Here, on the shores of the Arabian Sea, lies one of the world's ten largest caves...
Majlis al Jinn, or "meeting place of the Jinn."
According to Islamic texts, the Jinn are beings from a higher realm.
But they are not angels.
They have free will, and they disobey Allah, just as the Watchers are said to have disobeyed God in the Book of Enoch.
And many Muslims believe this 14-acre cavern is still inhabited by these otherworldly beings.
SABINA MAGLIOCCO:
In Islam, there is a class of beings known as Jinn.
The Jinn are angelic, and yet they are not of the ethereal realm.
They are of the earthly realm.
They're neither good nor evil.
They're shape shifters.
They can help you.
They can also trick you.
HENRY:
They are supposed to have had magic abilities, supernatural powers.
And humans greatly feared the Jinn.
They are just exiled beings who crossed over a forbidden boundary and now find themselves trapped in the earth plane.
NARRATOR:
In the Islamic texts, the Jinn appear only when they want to be seen, often influencing humans by whispering instructions to them while invisible.
BAR TZADOK:
In order to understand the nature of these entities, we must understand that in many ways they are the intermediary race.
Like human beings, they eat and drink.
Like human beings, they sexually procreate.
But, like the angels, they can shape-shift, fly and know the future.
NARRATOR:
Stories of encounters with the Jinn can be found throughout the Muslim world.
But could they be true?
And if so, are these the same otherworldly entities that are said to have descended to Earth before the time of the Great Flood, known as the Watchers?
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes, and claim that further evidence can be found with the stories of similar strange beings found all over the world.
In Africa, there are stories of the Orisha... demigods who came down from the sky that are said to speak every language and secretly influence events on Earth.
In Japan, the Tengu are birdlike creatures that are said to hide out in the mountains and change form to manipulate humans.
But if the Watchers were active on Earth hundreds of years ago, could they still be living among us even to this day?
Ancient astronaut theorists say yes, and for proof, they suggest we look no further than recent accounts of alien abductions.
January 25, 1967.
South Ashburnham, Massachusetts.
30-year-old Betty Andreasson is in her kitchen after dinner while her mother, father and seven children are in the living room.
Suddenly, the power goes out.
And when it comes back on a moment later, a beam of red light shoots through the window.
BETTY ANDREASSON LUCA:
We saw a flashing reddish orange light coming through the pantry window.
Five beings entered my home right through the wooden door.
They had large black eyes, tiny nose, thin slit mouth, tiny holes for ears.
A large, bulbous head.
And I was quite shocked, wondering, who or what is this, you know?
At that point, I was taken up into the craft.
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
Betty ends up going with them to someplace that she thinks is their world.
And she said it was more vivid than life itself.
WILCOCK:
Betty Andreasson's reports are very detailed and thorough.
There's lots and lots of specific drawings that she makes of technology on these ships.
This is before the era that anybody was talking about this stuff, so it was a totally unique experience for her.
NARRATOR:
A devout Christian,
Andreasson describes her abduction as a religious experience.
ANDREASSON LUCA:
The only thing I could think of... that they must be angels, for them to be able to pass through the door like that and to take me through that door the same way.
NARRATOR:
But for ancient astronaut theorists, this encounter is most significant because of how these strange beings identified themselves.
ANDREASSON LUCA:
They said that they were the Watchers.
NARRATOR:
But if extraterrestrial beings known as Watchers are still living among us today, why?
Perhaps the answer can be found by examining other cases of extraterrestrial abductions and by examining whether the Watchers are watching us or if there are other beings watching them.
NARRATOR:
June 1, 1990.
UFO investigator Raymond Fowler publishes The Watchers, an unprecedented inside look at the Betty Andreasson case.
After years of hypnosis, psych exams and interviews,
Fowler concludes that the strange beings Andreasson encountered that called themselves the Watchers were the same entities that are commonly identified today as Grey aliens.
HOWE:
It's very interesting, this word "Watchers,"
because when you talk with so many people, you begin to hear patterns.
And even if you're not sitting across from a man or a woman or a child who says,
"I was taken by a Watcher,"
what you hear is the abductees knew that they were dealing with something that knew everything about them... again, the Watcher idea, whether you use that name or not.
NARRATOR:
According to Betty's account, the extraterrestrials who took her aboard their craft subjected her to medical examination.
ANDREASSON LUCA:
And I was floated to a table.
And as he was examining me, he said they were going to have to measure me physically.
And at that point, they started to take this needlelike thing and thrust it into my navel.
And I could feel it going round and round inside me.
NARRATOR:
As incredible as Betty Andreasson's abduction story sounds, it is not unique.
Many alleged alien abductees give very similar accounts.
In 1961,
Betty and Barney Hill of Lancaster, New Hampshire made one of the earliest alien abduction reports when they claimed that they had been taken aboard a ship... placed naked on examination tables and probed by what they described as Grey aliens.
Linda Porter of Covina, California reported that in she, too, was taken aboard a ship
where she witnessed strange-looking creatures examining humans held in states of suspended animation.
But if these accounts are true, what is it that's being done to these abductees?
HENRY:
Watchers have two key areas of interest as concerned to humanity.
One is genetics and the other is technology, and both are found in the phenomena of alien abductions.
So one idea would be that the purpose of the abductions is to continue to tweak the human body to assist humanity in climbing the evolutionary ladder, so to speak.
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that the Watchers that were described in the Bible and the Book of Enoch really are responsible for the modern alien abduction phenomenon, and that they are continuing to alter our genetic makeup?
Or might there be another explanation?
Some ancient astronaut theorists suggest it is possible that modern alien abductions are not the work of those same Watchers that survived the Great Flood, but that instead, they are carried out by another group of extraterrestrials.
Watchers that have returned to Earth in search of those who stayed behind.
HOWE:
All of the people that I've interviewed, they would tell you the same thing.
These Watchers, they're not all of the same mind.
There seems to be conflict about what the future of humanity on this planet will be.
BAR TZADOK:
The legends teach us that the Watchers fight amongst themselves, and that they will each manipulate segments of humanity so as to express their own agendas, and therefore it is they who influence nations to go to war and to fight for their purposes
and not necessarily for our own betterment.
CHILDRESS:
And you have to wonder if many of the modern-day abductions, such as Betty Andreasson, are really extraterrestrials who are searching for the Watchers.
NARRATOR:
Could it be that extraterrestrials are abducting humans because they are actually looking for other alien beings hiding among us?
Ancient astronaut theorists suggest that the answer may be found by taking a closer look at the United States government's most secret projects.
NARRATOR:
San Francisco, California.
June 6, 2011.
At the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference,
Steve Jobs introduces the world to his latest technological breakthrough... iCloud.
This new service allows users to store all of their digital data... such as music, e-mail, contacts, documents, photos and Internet search history... on pools of remote servers collectively known as the Cloud.
This revolutionary technology takes off so fast that within two years there are over 300 million people on the Cloud.
And because it is built into every Apple device, some people use the Cloud without even realizing it.
But while Apple assures its customers that their personal files are secure, in August of 2014, explicit personal photos of female celebrities begin to pop up online.
The Cloud has been hacked.
KAMKAR:
All of your information is now on the Cloud.
It's now somewhere else.
Sure, you can always potentially access it and read that information back, but that also means someone else now has access to your data.
That data could be your e-mails.
It could be your messages.
It could be phone calls.
It could be voice mails.
DICE:
It's incredible because you're literally just handing your data over to an unknown location run by who knows who.
Many people see very big security issues with these.
You're no longer personally having control of your own data on your own hard drive.
You're just sending it off into the ether, uh, to who knows where.
NARRATOR:
When Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 the extent to which our privacy has been compromised, it drew public outrage.
But as the march of technology moves forward, are we adapting to the notion that nothing is sacred or secret?
And is it possible that extraterrestrials who have been watching us for thousands of years actually led us to this point?
Could it be that our increased reliance on computers, cell phones, tablets and anything else connected to the Internet is the product of extraterrestrial design, giving the Watchers greater access to us than ever before?
DICE:
We're living in a day and age now where everybody is carrying literally a camera and a microphone in their hand or in their pocket that can be remotely activated by the NSA or various number of intelligence agencies or even hackers.
The Webcams in all laptops and the microphones can be easily remotely activated.
CHILDRESS:
It really seems that because of technology these extraterrestrials step up their monitoring and watch every little detail of what goes on.
And they want to see our planet nurture certain civilizations that are technologically minded.
NARRATOR:
But there are some who believe the highly interconnected society we now live in provides for even more shocking implications.
They say that extraterrestrials may actually be in league with world leaders, monitoring each and every one of us in an effort to root out the Watchers who have been hiding among us for thousands of years.
HOWE:
The United States government has proof that at least three competing geopolitical, territorial extraterrestrial groups that are in conflict with each other have been on this planet.
The intervention may actually be positive for humans going forward.
But we are also presented the idea that we are dealing with intelligences that may actually want to do harm, and have done harm.
It is as if there were political parties in the cosmos.
NARRATOR:
Is it possible, as ancient astronaut theorists contend, that the Watchers really do exist, and are still here on Earth watching over us?
Could we be under surveillance by not one group of Watchers, but several?
And might a secret conglomeration of the world's most powerful leaders have actually taken a side in this extraterrestrial conflict?
Perhaps very soon we will discover that aliens have been among us all along... watching us... and guiding us.
Not only in the interest of our own future, but also
theirs.
Raj, your tag's sticking out.
Thank you.
That was the closest I've come to sex in, like, two years.
Now I feel a little gross.
You're only making it seem more real for me.
Hey, that's my wife.
If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me.
Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
How about Penny's depressing acting career?
Hey.
I mean, it's been a little tough, but Penny's following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.
Aw...
Thank you.
Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
Is that a real book?
I would totally read that book.
Can I borrow it when you're done?
Well, I'll have you guys know
I turned down a part in a movie last week.
Why would you do that?
Because it was crap.
It's a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
Serial Ape-ist?
I thought you died in that.
She does.
42 minutes in.
While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
I have an eidetic memory.
I don't know what his problem is.
Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one.
They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
Am I missing something, or isn't that the part she was born to play?

So are you really not gonna do this movie?
Well, I don't think it's the kind of part that's good for my career.
Well, but don't a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?
Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep ever had to say...
"Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!"
If she did, it would be amazing.
That woman can do no wrong.
I-I don't know anything about show business, so if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings,
I'm sure you know what you're doing.
I think we're gonna go.
Are you sure?
We were making fun of failed careers.
We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard's.
Hey, I work at the same university you do.
Yes, and Hawkeye's in the Avengers, but no one ever says, "Help, Hawkeye!"
Can I ask you something?
Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
Oh, I'm sure he does it out of love.
The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.
I think we're gonna go.
No, no, no.
This is not a fight.
I-I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you'd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it.
Now it's a fight.
Well, with that sorted out,
I'm happy to answer your question, Bernadette.
Howard started it.
I didn't do anything.
I was just sitting here.
I wasn't referring to this evening.
Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman.
And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.
Still funny.
That was ten years ago.
Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.
Really?
The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds.
That's funny!
I was there.
It was funny.
In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions.
To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny.
Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.
Thanks for walking me to my car.
Actually, it's for both of us.
Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I'm a little freaked out by street gangs.
Why can't Raj find a girl?
The mystery continues.
I don't appreciate your sarcasm, but we've still got two blocks to go, so I'll put up with it.
Whatever happened with your online dating?
No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.
Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too.
Once, I even dropped in on my OB/GYN just to get some human contact.
It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.
What?
You've kissed, like, once in three years.
That's true.
Do whatever you want.
Hey.
Hello.
Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.
Really?
I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and... she made some great points.
You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn't hear the rest 'cause she took her bra off.
Very well.
How do you propose we move forward?
Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.
That's a great idea.
And in the spirit of our new arrangement,
I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.
Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend.
They gave me two tickets.
Bernadette can't go.
You want to come with me?
You can visit your mom, and I'll show you around the space center.
I have one question.
Is this a prank... where we land in Houston and you've made up wanted posters that have my face with a mustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?
No.
I'm glad because I would not have seen that coming.
Amy, I could use some help.
Oh.
Let me guess.
There's an... undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl's profile.
She's amazing.
Oh, she's cute.
And smart.
Phi Beta Kappa.
And judging by her lack of Adam's apple, she's been female her entire life.
I like that in a woman.
Great, so what do you need me for?
Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.
All right.
"Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower..."
Wow.
I know.
Powerful stuff, huh?
No.
You're supposed to be yourself, not all... desperate and creepy.
Okay, I'm getting some mixed messages here.
Just say something normal like, "I saw your profile.
"Looks like we have a lot in common;
let's get a cup of coffee sometime." Yes. "Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips."
Or you just write it for me.
I'm not gonna pretend to be you.
I don't want you to pretend to be me.
You can be like my, uh, online wingman.
Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
Well, what would I say to her?
Just tell her what I'm really like.
And, if you think it'll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar.
Use your own words.
Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
Oh, it's no problem.
Is everything okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
It's just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip.
There's the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.
Remember the old days when I would've said something dumb like "Why?"
Uh, that doesn't sound good.
Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
Yes.
Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane:
Penny, your check engine...
Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I cannot afford this right now.
Maybe it's just something minor.
Ooh, good news, the light just went out.
Are we playing individual or teams?
Teams are fun.
Oh, in that case, I'd like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.
But I'm always on Howard's team.
We're best friends.
The kind who finish each others...
I really don't think we do tha do that!
See?
Oh, hi.
Oh, how'd it go at the mechanic?
Not great.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
Isn't it a little late to get plane tick plane tickets?
Yeah.
Will you please sto stop that?
Okay.
I don't know what to do.
My car threw a rod and it's totaled.
I can't afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can't drive to auditions.
I'm so sorry.
I know it's a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?
I did.
I called them.
The part's gone.
They gave it to someone else.
Now that girl's gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
At least they talked about you on Letterman.
Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.
How?
Unlike me, you have a job.
I'm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress...
- Oh.
...like I will be for the rest of my life.
Leonard, would you wrap it up?
We're waiting on you.
I'm sorry, is the fact that my life's falling apart interfering with your board game?
It is.
You were wrong, friend Howard.
She completely understood.
Hey, you busy?
No.
What's up?
Have you heard back from Emily?
I have.
Great!
And?
And I'm afraid she doesn't think you're right for her.
I give you one simple thing to do-- contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me-- and you blow it!
I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn't write to her yourself.
She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.
I'm not too shy and passive.
You write her back and tell her I said that.
You know, when you have a second.
Look, I'll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.
What's happening tomorrow night?
I'm meeting her for coffee.
What?
!
Well, we just... we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.
I find a girl I like, and you're stealing her?
!
No.
We just ended up having a lot in common.
We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we're both hardcore into quilting.
Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
That's Sheldon.
He says he'll be down in a minute.
What are you doing?
Oh, he's not coming out until he sees proof you don't have an air freshener in your car.
This is gonna be a long weekend for you.
You're the reason I'm doing it!
I said to stop insulting each other.
I didn't tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
How do I know what you said?
Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
Hello.
Hi.
Hey, buddy.
You excited for Texas?
Oh, very much so.
It's not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.
Who's the real astronaut?
Buzz Aldrin.
Oh.
Yay!
Howard?
Howard?
Howard?
What now?
I have to go to the bathroom.
You just went to the bathroom.
I didn't use it because it didn't seem safe.
Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.
Well, it still doesn't.
I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.
Fine.
Why are you getting annoyed?
I'm trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.
Like when?
When?
!
How about in the car?
I'm an astronaut, and you know it.
You just don't like admitting it, because you're jealous.
Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space.
Those astronauts were my heroes.
And... when you got to go, it was hard for me.
Thank you.
Because it made me realize they'll just send anyone up there.
Aren't you going to let me out?
No.
But I still need to use the bathroom.
Here you go.
Be creative.
What's the matter?
Scared of a little turbulence?
No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere.
I'm not scared at all.
Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.
Oh, this is nothing.
I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut.
Okay, that was a big one.
I take it back.
I'm scared of turbulence!
I'm gonna need that bag back.
You sure you want to do this?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't I want to get my old job back?
It'll be fun to see everyone.
I haven't talked to them since I said,
"I quit.
See you at the Oscars, bitches."
Come on, let's just get this over with.
"Let's get this over with."
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex?
I'm just...
I'm trying to lighten the mood.
I know.
Thank you.
Sorry.
It's just so humiliating.
So humiliating?
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory...?
I'm sorry.
I'll-I'll stop.
I'll stop.
Come on, don't look so sad.
You never know what's gonna happen.
Maybe tonight will be great.
Sweetie, I know you're trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it's making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you.
This isn't your car.
I know.
I thought we'd take yours.
I don't understand.
It's nothing fancy, but it'll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don't have to go back to waitressing.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Oh, my God.
I mean, you could say, "Thank you."
I did just buy you a car.
Mmm.
Look, I admit that it's odd that Rajesh didn't write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you'll see he's just a sweet, regular guy.
As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.
Hello, Emily.
Hello.
Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy.
Let me ask you something.
Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say,
"Hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?"
No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.
Uh, okay, that's a separate issue.
Let's put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
I'm leaving.
Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
You know, I think I'm just gonna go by myself.
Not my best first date.
Yeah, but not my worst, either.
I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you!
I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!
If you weren't my friend, there'd be a hole in my life!
Thank you, Sheldon.
Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled.
But not as big.
The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign.
You're now free to move about the cabin.
It's over.
Yeah.
Should we stop holding hands now?
In a minute.
Okay, good.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Raj, your tag's sticking out.
Thank you.
That was the closest I've come to sex
In, like, two years.
Now I feel a little gross.
You're only making it seem more real for me.
Hey, that's my wife.
If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me.
Can we please talk about something
Other than my depressing love life?
How about penny's depressing acting career?
Hey.
I mean, it's been a little tough,
But penny's following her dreams,
And in my book, that is not depressing.
Aw...
Thank you.
Is that book called lies I tell to get sex?
Is that a real book?
I would totally read that book.
Can I borrow it when you're done?
Well, I'll have you guys know
I turned down a part in a movie last week.
Why would you do that?
Because it was crap.
It's a sequel to that awful
Killer gorilla movie I was in.
Serial ape-ist?
I thought you died in that.
She does.
42 minutes in.
While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt
During a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
I have an eidetic memory.
I don't know what his problem is.
Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one.
They just try to clone me from my corpse,
But my dna gets mixed with the ape's dna
And I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
Am I missing something,
Or isn't that the part she was born to play?
♪ our whole universe was in a hot, dense state ♪
♪ then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...
Wait!
♪
♪ the earth began to cool
♪ the autotrophs began to drool, neanderthals developed tools ♪
♪ we built the wall ♪ we built the pyramids ♪
♪ math, science, history, unraveling the mystery ♪
♪ that all started with a big bang ♪
♪ bang!
♪
So are you really not gonna do this movie?
Well, I don't think it's the kind of part
That's good for my career.
Well, but don't a lot of famous actors
Get their start doing bad movies?
Okay, I don't think meryl streep ever had to say... (deep voice):
"must keep gorilla hands
From killing again!"
If she did, it would be amazing.
That woman can do no wrong.
I-I don't know anything about show business,
So if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work
And just burn through your savings,
I'm sure you know what you're doing.
I think we're gonna go.
Sheldon:
Are you sure?
We were making fun of failed careers.
We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is howard's.
Hey, I work at the same university you do.
Yes, and hawkeye's in the avengers,
But no one ever says, "help, hawkeye!"
Can I ask you something?
Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
Penny:
Oh, I'm sure
He does it out of love.
The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible
About my life choices.
I think we're gonna go.
No, no, no.
This is not a fight.
I-I was just excited that someone offered you a part
And a little surprised that you'd rather sit at home
And do nothing than take it.
Now it's a fight.
Well, with that sorted out,
I'm happy to answer your question, bernadette.
Howard started it.
I didn't do anything.
I was just sitting here.
I wasn't referring to this evening.
Ten years ago, upon first seeing me,
Your husband claimed that I looked like c-3po
And pee-wee herman.
And he called me c-3p-wee herman.
(chuckles, sighs) still funny.
(chuckles)
That was ten years ago.
Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago,
He followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture
With photographs of nude fat women bending over.
Really?
The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds.
That's funny!
I was there.
It was funny.
In any event, that began a decade-long progression
Of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions.
To this day, I still get a monthly copy
Of granny on granny.
Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page,
Is complete filth.
Thanks for walking me to my car.
Actually, it's for both of us.
Last night, I watched west side story,
And I'm a little freaked out by street gangs.
Why can't raj find a girl?
The mystery continues.
I don't appreciate your sarcasm,
But we've still got two blocks to go, so I'll put up with it.
Whatever happened with your online dating?
(sighs) no one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.
Before I met sheldon, I was ready to give up, too.
Once, I even dropped in on my ob/gyn
Just to get some human contact.
It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
Then I met sheldon and look at where we are now.
What?
You've kissed, like, once in three years.
That's true.
Do whatever you want.
Hey.
Hello.
Listen, I was thinking
You and I could probably try to be better friends.
Really?
I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
Seriously, I was talking to bernadette last night and...
She made some great points.
You and I have known each other a long time,
And I didn't hear the rest 'cause she took her bra off.
Very well.
(clears throat)
How do you propose we move forward?
Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.
That's a great idea.
And in the spirit of our new arrangement,
I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.
Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at nasa
In houston this weekend.
They gave me two tickets.
Bernadette can't go.
You want to come with me?
You can visit your mom,
And I'll show you around the space center.
I have one question.
Is this a prank...
Where we land in houston
And you've made up wanted posters
That have my face with a mustache and a spanish name
And then I get arrested and deported to south america?
No.
I'm glad because I would not have seen that coming.
Amy, I could use some help.
Oh.
Let me guess.
There's an...
Undergrad in a leather jacket
Snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
I thought about what you said last night,
And I went back on the dating web site
And I was looking at this girl's profile.
She's amazing.
Oh, she's cute.
And smart.
Phi beta kappa.
And judging by her lack of adam's apple,
She's been female her entire life.
I like that in a woman.
Great, so what do you need me for?
Well, I was up all night trying to write to her,
But I wanted to run it by you first.
All right.
(clears throat)
"emily,
Your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower..."
Wow.
I know.
Powerful stuff, huh?
No.
You're supposed to be yourself, not all...
Desperate and creepy.
Okay, I'm getting some mixed messages here.
Just say something normal like, "I saw your profile.
"looks like we have a lot in common;
let's get
A cup of coffee sometime." yes. "where I can be
Jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips."
Or you just write it for me.
I'm not gonna pretend to be you.
I don't want you to pretend to be me.
You can be like my, uh, online wingman.
Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
Well, what would I say to her?
Just tell her what I'm really like.
And, if you think it'll help,
That you saw me changing once and my package reminded you
Of the muscular tail of a jaguar.
Use your own words.
Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
Oh, it's no problem.
Is everything okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
It's just some, uh,
Stomach medication for my trip.
There's the remote yet distinct possibility
That I may end up in south america.
Remember the old days when I would've said something dumb
Like "why?"
(clanking)
(rhythmic whirring)
Uh, that doesn't sound good.
Remember the old days when I used to point out
That your check engine light was on?
Yes.
Well, get ready
To stroll down memory lane:
Penny, your check engine...
Yeah, I know it's on, sheldon!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I cannot afford this right now.
Maybe it's just something minor.
(engine clanks, sputters out)
(steam hissing)
Ooh, good news, the light just went out.
Are we playing individual or teams?
Teams are fun.
Oh, in that case, I'd like to be partnered
With my good friend howard.
But I'm always on howard's team.
We're best friends.
The kind who finish each others...
I really don't think we do tha Do that!
See?
Oh, hi.
Oh, how'd it go
At the mechanic?
Not great.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
Maybe I can go with you guys to houston?
Isn't it a little late to get plane tick Plane tickets?
Yeah.
Will you please sto Stop that?
Okay.
Penny:
I don't know what to do.
My car threw a rod and it's totaled.
I can't afford a new one, I have no job,
And now I can't drive to auditions.
I'm so sorry.
I know it's a sensitive subject,
But can you reconsider that part in the movie?
I did.
I called them.
The part's gone.
They gave it to someone else.
Now that girl's gonna get discovered and become famous
And go on letterman and talk about how she got her big break

At least they talked about you on letterman.
Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.
How?
Unlike me, you have a job.
I'm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress...
Oh.
(crying): ...

Leonard, would you wrap it up?
We're waiting on you.
I'm sorry, is the fact that my life's falling apart
Interfering with your board game?

Come on, let's just get this over with.

Am I driving you to the cheesecake factory,

I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Oh, my god.
I mean, you could say, "thank you."
I did just buy you a car.

Raj, your tag's sticking out.
Thank you.
That was the closest I've come to sex in, like, two years.
Now I feel a little gross.
You're only making it seem more real for me.
Hey, that's my wife.
If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me.
Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
How about Penny's depressing acting career?
Hey.
I mean, it's been a little tough, but Penny's following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.
Aw...
Thank you.
Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
Is that a real book?
I would totally read that book.

So are you really not gonna do this movie?
Well, I don't think it's the kind of part that's good for my career.
Well, but don't a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?
Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep ever had to say...
"Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!"
If she did, it would be amazing.
That woman can do no wrong.
I-I don't know anything about show business, so if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I'm sure you know what you're doing.
I think we're gonna go.
Are you sure?
We were making fun of failed careers.
We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard's.
Hey, I work at the same university you do.
Yes, and Hawkeye's in the Avengers, but no one ever says, "Help, Hawkeye!"
Can I ask you something?
Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
Oh, I'm sure he does it out of love.
The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.
I think we're gonna go.
No, no, no.
This is not a fight.
I-I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you'd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it.
Now it's a fight.
Well, with that sorted out,
I'm happy to answer your question, Bernadette.
Howard started it.
I didn't do anything.
I was just sitting here.
I wasn't referring to this evening.
Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman.
And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.
Still funny.
That was ten years ago.
Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.
Really?
The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds.
That's funny!
I was there.
It was funny.
In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions.
To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny.
Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.
Thanks for walking me to my car.
Actually, it's for both of us.
Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I'm a little freaked out by street gangs.
Why can't Raj find a girl?
The mystery continues.
I don't appreciate your sarcasm, but we've still got two blocks to go, so I'll put up with it.
Whatever happened with your online dating?
No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.
Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too.
Once, I even dropped in on my OB/GYN just to get some human contact.
It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.
What?
You've kissed, like, once in three years.
That's true.
Do whatever you want.
Hey.
Hello.
Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.
Really?
I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and... she made some great points.
You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn't hear the rest 'cause she took her bra off.
Very well.
How do you propose we move forward?
Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.
That's a great idea.
And in the spirit of our new arrangement,
I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.
Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend.
They gave me two tickets.
Bernadette can't go.
You want to come with me?
You can visit your mom, and I'll show you around the space center.
I have one question.
Is this a prank... where we land in Houston and you've made up wanted posters that have my face with a mustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?
No.
I'm glad because I would not have seen that coming.
Amy, I could use some help.
Oh.
Let me guess.
There's an... undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl's profile.
She's amazing.
Oh, she's cute.
And smart.
Phi Beta Kappa.
And judging by her lack of Adam's apple, she's been female her entire life.
I like that in a woman.
Great, so what do you need me for?
Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.
All right.
"Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower..."
Wow.
I know.
Powerful stuff, huh?
No.
You're supposed to be yourself, not all... desperate and creepy.
Okay, I'm getting some mixed messages here.
Just say something normal like, "I saw your profile.
"Looks like we have a lot in common;
Let's get a cup of coffee sometime."
Yes. "Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips."
Or you just write it for me.
- I'm not gonna pretend to be you.
- I don't want you to pretend to be me.
You can be like my, uh, online wingman.
Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
Well, what would I say to her?
Just tell her what I'm really like.
And, if you think it'll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar.
Use your own words.
Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
Oh, it's no problem.
Is everything okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
It's just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip.
There's the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.
Remember the old days when I would've said something dumb like "Why?"
Uh, that doesn't sound good.
Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
Yes.
Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane:
Penny, your check engine...
Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I cannot afford this right now.
Maybe it's just something minor.
Ooh, good news, the light just went out.
Are we playing individual or teams?
Teams are fun.
Oh, in that case, I'd like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.
But I'm always on Howard's team.
We're best friends.
The kind who finish each others...
- I really don't think we do tha...
- ...do that!
See?
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, how'd it go at the mechanic?
Not great.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
- Isn't it a little late to get plane tick...
- ...plane tickets?
Yeah.
- Will you please sto...
- ...stop that?
Okay.
I don't know what to do.
My car threw a rod and it's totaled.
I can't afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can't drive to auditions.
I'm so sorry.
I know it's a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?
I did.
I called them.
The part's gone.
They gave it to someone else.
Now that girl's gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
At least they talked about you on Letterman.
Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.
How?
Unlike me, you have a job.
- I'm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress...
- Oh.
...like I will be for the rest of my life.
Leonard, would you wrap it up?
We're waiting on you.
I'm sorry, is the fact that my life's falling apart interfering with your board game?
It is.
You were wrong, friend Howard.
She completely understood.
Hey, you busy?
No.
What's up?
Have you heard back from Emily?
- I have.
- Great!
And?
And I'm afraid she doesn't think you're right for her.
I give you one simple thing to do-- contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me-- and you blow it!
I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn't write to her yourself.
She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.
I'm not too shy and passive.
You write her back and tell her I said that.
You know, when you have a second.
Look, I'll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.
What's happening tomorrow night?
I'm meeting her for coffee.
What?
!
Well, we just... we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.
- I find a girl I like, and you're stealing her?
!
- No.
We just ended up having a lot in common.
We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we're both hardcore into quilting.
Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
That's Sheldon.
He says he'll be down in a minute.
What are you doing?
Oh, he's not coming out until he sees proof you don't have an air freshener in your car.
This is gonna be a long weekend for you.
You're the reason I'm doing it!
I said to stop insulting each other.
I didn't tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
How do I know what you said?
Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hey, buddy.
You excited for Texas?
Oh, very much so.
It's not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.
Who's the real astronaut?
- Buzz Aldrin.
- Oh.
Yay!
Howard?
Howard?
Howard?
What now?
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- You just went to the bathroom.
I didn't use it because it didn't seem safe.
Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.
- Well, it still doesn't.
- I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.
Fine.
- Why are you getting annoyed?
- I'm trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.
- Like when?
- When?
!
How about in the car?
I'm an astronaut, and you know it.
You just don't like admitting it, because you're jealous.
Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space.
Those astronauts were my heroes.
And... when you got to go, it was hard for me.
Thank you.
Because it made me realize they'll just send anyone up there.
- Aren't you going to let me out?
- No.
But I still need to use the bathroom.
Here you go.
Be creative.
What's the matter?
Scared of a little turbulence?
No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere.
I'm not scared at all.
Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.
Oh, this is nothing.
I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut.
Okay, that was a big one.
I take it back.
I'm scared of turbulence!
I'm gonna need that bag back.
You sure you want to do this?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't I want to get my old job back?
It'll be fun to see everyone.
I haven't talked to them since I said, "I quit.
See you at the Oscars, bitches."
Come on, let's just get this over with.
"Let's get this over with."
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex?
I'm just...
I'm trying to lighten the mood.
- I know.
Thank you.
- Sorry.
- It's just so humiliating.
- So humiliating?
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory...?
I'm sorry.
I'll-I'll stop.
I'll stop.
Come on, don't look so sad.
You never know what's gonna happen.
Maybe tonight will be great.
Sweetie, I know you're trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it's making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you.
This isn't your car.
I know.
I thought we'd take yours.
I don't understand.
It's nothing fancy, but it'll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don't have to go back to waitressing.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Oh, my God.
I mean, you could say, "Thank you." I did just buy you a car.
Mmm.
Look, I admit that it's odd that Rajesh didn't write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you'll see he's just a sweet, regular guy.
As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.
- Hello, Emily.
- Hello.
Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy.
Let me ask you something.
Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say,
"Hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?"
No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.
Uh, okay, that's a separate issue.
Let's put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
I'm leaving.
Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
You know, I think I'm just gonna go by myself.
Not my best first date.
Yeah, but not my worst, either.
I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you!
I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!
If you weren't my friend, there'd be a hole in my life!
Thank you, Sheldon.
Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled.
But not as big.
The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign.
You're now free to move about the cabin.
- It's over.
- Yeah.
Should we stop holding hands now?
- In a minute.
- Okay, good.

Raj, your tag's sticking out.
Thank you.
That was the closest I've come to sex in, like, two years.
Now I feel a little gross.
You're only making it seem more real for me.
Hey, that's my wife.
If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me.
Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
How about Penny's depressing acting career?
Hey.
I mean, it's been a little tough, but Penny's following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.
Aw...
Thank you.
Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
Is that a real book?
I would totally read that book.
Can I borrow it when you're done?
Well, I'll have you guys know
I turned down a part in a movie last week.
Why would you do that?
Because it was crap.
It's a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
Serial Ape-ist?
I thought you died in that.
She does.
42 minutes in.
While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
I have an eidetic memory.
I don't know what his problem is.
Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one.
They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
Am I missing something, or isn't that the part she was born to play?

I-I don't know anything about show business, so if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings,
I'm sure you know what you're doing.
I think we're gonna go.
Are you sure?
We were making fun of failed careers.
We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard's.
Hey, I work at the same university you do.
Yes, and Hawkeye's in the Avengers, but no one ever says, "Help, Hawkeye!"
Can I ask you something?
Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
Oh, I'm sure he does it out of love.

It was funny.
In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions.
To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny.
Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.
Thanks for walking me to my car.
Actually, it's for both of us.
Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I'm a little freaked out by street gangs.
Why can't Raj find a girl?

No.
I'm glad because I would not have seen that coming.
Amy, I could use some help.
Oh.
Let me guess.
There's an... undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl's profile.
She's amazing.
Oh, she's cute.
And smart.
Phi Beta Kappa.
And judging by her lack of Adam's apple, she's been female her entire life.

Just tell her what I'm really like.
And, if you think it'll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar.
Use your own words.
Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
Oh, it's no problem.
Is everything okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
It's just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip.
There's the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.

Isn't it a little late to get plane tick plane tickets?
Yeah.
Will you please sto stop that?
Okay.
I don't know what to do.
My car threw a rod and it's totaled.
I can't afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can't drive to auditions.

Uh, okay, that's a separate issue.
Let's put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
I'm leaving.
Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
You know, I think I'm just gonna go by myself.
Not my best first date.
Yeah, but not my worst, either.
I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you!
I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!
If you weren't my friend, there'd be a hole in my life!
Thank you, Sheldon.
Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled.
But not as big.
The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign.
You're now free to move about the cabin.
It's over.
Yeah.
Should we stop holding hands now?
In a minute.
Okay, good.

Raj, your tag's sticking out.
Thank you.
That was the closest I've come to sex in, like, two years.
Now I feel a little gross.
You're only making it seem more real for me.
Hey, that's my wife.
If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me.
Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
How about Penny's depressing acting career?
Hey.
I mean, it's been a little tough, but Penny's following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.
Aw...
Thank you.
Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
Is that a real book?
I would totally read that book.
Can I borrow it when you're done?
Well, I'll have you guys know
I turned down a part in a movie last week.
Why would you do that?
Because it was crap.
It's a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
Serial Ape-ist?
I thought you died in that.
She does.
42 minutes in.
While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
I have an eidetic memory.
I don't know what his problem is.
Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one.
They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
Am I missing something, or isn't that the part she was born to play?

So are you really not gonna do this movie?
Well, I don't think it's the kind of part that's good for my career.
Well, but don't a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?
Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep ever had to say... (deep voice):
"Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!"
If she did, it would be amazing.
That woman can do no wrong.
I-I don't know anything about show business, so if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings,
I'm sure you know what you're doing.
I think we're gonna go.
SHELDON:
Are you sure?
We were making fun of failed careers.
We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard's.
Hey, I work at the same university you do.
Yes, and Hawkeye's in the Avengers, but no one ever says, "Help, Hawkeye!"
Can I ask you something?
Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
PENNY:
Oh, I'm sure he does it out of love.
The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.
I think we're gonna go.
No, no, no.
This is not a fight.
I-I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you'd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it.
Now it's a fight.
Well, with that sorted out,
I'm happy to answer your question, Bernadette.
Howard started it.
I didn't do anything.
I was just sitting here.
I wasn't referring to this evening.
Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman.
And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.
(chuckles, sighs) Still funny.
(chuckles)
That was ten years ago.
Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.
Really?
The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds.
That's funny!
I was there.
It was funny.
In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions.
To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny.
Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.
Thanks for walking me to my car.
Actually, it's for both of us.
Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I'm a little freaked out by street gangs.
Why can't Raj find a girl?
The mystery continues.
I don't appreciate your sarcasm, but we've still got two blocks to go, so I'll put up with it.
Whatever happened with your online dating?
(sighs) No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.
Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too.
Once, I even dropped in on my OB/GYN just to get some human contact.
It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.
What?
You've kissed, like, once in three years.
That's true.
Do whatever you want.
Hey.
Hello.
Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.
Really?
I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and... she made some great points.
You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn't hear the rest 'cause she took her bra off.
Very well.
(clears throat)
How do you propose we move forward?
Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.
That's a great idea.
And in the spirit of our new arrangement,
I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.
Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend.
They gave me two tickets.
Bernadette can't go.
You want to come with me?
You can visit your mom, and I'll show you around the space center.
I have one question.
Is this a prank... where we land in Houston and you've made up wanted posters that have my face with a mustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?
No.
I'm glad because I would not have seen that coming.
Amy, I could use some help.
Oh.
Let me guess.
There's an... undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl's profile.
She's amazing.
Oh, she's cute.
And smart.
Phi Beta Kappa.
And judging by her lack of Adam's apple, she's been female her entire life.
I like that in a woman.
Great, so what do you need me for?
Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.
All right.
(clears throat)
"Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower..."
Wow.
I know.
Powerful stuff, huh?
No.
You're supposed to be yourself, not all... desperate and creepy.
Okay, I'm getting some mixed messages here.
Just say something normal like, "I saw your profile.
"Looks like we have a lot in common;
let's get a cup of coffee sometime." Yes. "Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips."
Or you just write it for me.
I'm not gonna pretend to be you.
I don't want you to pretend to be me.
You can be like my, uh, online wingman.
Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
Well, what would I say to her?
Just tell her what I'm really like.
And, if you think it'll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar.
Use your own words.
Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
Oh, it's no problem.
Is everything okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
It's just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip.
There's the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.
Remember the old days when I would've said something dumb like "Why?"
(clanking)
(rhythmic whirring)
Uh, that doesn't sound good.
Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
Yes.
Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane:
Penny, your check engine...
Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I cannot afford this right now.
Maybe it's just something minor.
(engine clanks, sputters out)
(steam hissing)
Ooh, good news, the light just went out.
Are we playing individual or teams?
Teams are fun.
Oh, in that case, I'd like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.
But I'm always on Howard's team.
We're best friends.
The kind who finish each others...
I really don't think we do tha do that!
See?
Oh, hi.
Oh, how'd it go at the mechanic?
Not great.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
Isn't it a little late to get plane tick plane tickets?
Yeah.
Will you please sto stop that?
Okay.
PENNY:
I don't know what to do.
My car threw a rod and it's totaled.
I can't afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can't drive to auditions.
I'm so sorry.
I know it's a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?
I did.
I called them.
The part's gone.
They gave it to someone else.
Now that girl's gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
At least they talked about you on Letterman.
Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.
How?
Unlike me, you have a job.
I'm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress...
- Oh.
(crying): ...
like I will be for the rest of my life.
Leonard, would you wrap it up?
We're waiting on you.
I'm sorry, is the fact that my life's falling apart interfering with your board game?
It is.
You were wrong, friend Howard.
She completely understood.
(knocking)
Hey, you busy?
No.
What's up?
Have you heard back from Emily?
I have.
Great!
And?
And I'm afraid she doesn't think you're right for her.
I give you one simple thing to do-- contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me-- and you blow it!
I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn't write to her yourself.
She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.
I'm not too shy and passive.
You write her back and tell her I said that.
You know, when you have a second.
Look, I'll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.
What's happening tomorrow night?
I'm meeting her for coffee.
What?
!
Well, we just... we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.
I find a girl I like, and you're stealing her?
!
No.
We just ended up having a lot in common.
We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we're both hardcore into quilting.
Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
That's Sheldon.
He says he'll be down in a minute.
What are you doing?
Oh, he's not coming out until he sees proof you don't have an air freshener in your car.
This is gonna be a long weekend for you.
You're the reason I'm doing it!
I said to stop insulting each other.
I didn't tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
How do I know what you said?
Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
(car door opens)
Hello.
Hi.
Hey, buddy.
(car door closes) You excited for Texas?
Oh, very much so.
It's not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.
(gasps) Who's the real astronaut?
Buzz Aldrin.
Oh.
Yay!
(bell dings)
Howard?
Howard?
Howard?
What now?
I have to go to the bathroom.
You just went to the bathroom.
I didn't use it because it didn't seem safe.
Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.
Well, it still doesn't.
I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.
Fine.
Why are you getting annoyed?
I'm trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.
Like when?
When?
!
How about in the car?
I'm an astronaut, and you know it.
You just don't like admitting it, because you're jealous.
Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space.
Those astronauts were my heroes.
And... when you got to go, it was hard for me.
Thank you.
Because it made me realize they'll just send anyone up there.
Aren't you going to let me out?
No.
But I still need to use the bathroom.
Here you go.
Be creative.
(rumbling)
(gasps)
What's the matter?
Scared of a little turbulence?
No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere.
I'm not scared at all.
(rumbling)
Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.
Oh, this is nothing.
I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut.
(rumbling)
Okay, that was a big one.
I take it back.
I'm scared of turbulence!
I'm gonna need that bag back.
(rumbling continues)
You sure you want to do this?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't I want to get my old job back?
It'll be fun to see everyone.
I haven't talked to them since I said,
"I quit.
See you at the Oscars, bitches."
Come on, let's just get this over with.
"Let's get this over with."
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex?
I'm just...
I'm trying to lighten the mood.
I know.
Thank you.
Sorry.
It's just so humiliating.
So humiliating?
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory...?
I'm sorry.
I'll-I'll stop.
I'll stop.
Come on, don't look so sad.
You never know what's gonna happen.
Maybe tonight will be great.
Sweetie, I know you're trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it's making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you.
This isn't your car.
I know.
I thought we'd take yours.
I don't understand.
It's nothing fancy, but it'll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don't have to go back to waitressing.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Oh, my God.
I mean, you could say, "Thank you."
I did just buy you a car.
Mmm.
Look, I admit that it's odd that Rajesh didn't write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you'll see he's just a sweet, regular guy.
As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.
Hello, Emily.
Hello.
Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy.
Let me ask you something.
Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say,
"Hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?"
No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.
Uh, okay, that's a separate issue.
Let's put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
I'm leaving.
Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
You know, I think I'm just gonna go by myself.
Not my best first date.
Yeah, but not my worst, either.
(rumbling)
I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you!
I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!
(rumbling, rattling, passengers gasping)
If you weren't my friend, there'd be a hole in my life!
Thank you, Sheldon.
Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled.
But not as big.
(bell dings)
WOMAN:
The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign.
You're now free to move about the cabin.
It's over.
Yeah.
(both panting)
Should we stop holding hands now?
In a minute.
Okay, good.

How about in the car?
I'm an astronaut, and you know it.
You just don't like admitting it, because you're jealous.
Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space.
Those astronauts were my heroes.
And... when you got to go, it was hard for me.
Thank you.
Because it made me realize they'll just send anyone up there.
Aren't you going to let me out?
No.
But I still need to use the bathroom.
Here you go.
Be creative.
(rumbling)
(gasps)
What's the matter?
Scared of a little turbulence?
No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere.
I'm not scared at all.
(rumbling)
Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.
Oh, this is nothing.
I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut.
(rumbling)
Okay, that was a big one.
I take it back.
I'm scared of turbulence!
I'm gonna need that bag back.
(rumbling continues)
You sure you want to do this?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't I want to get my old job back?
It'll be fun to see everyone.
I haven't talked to them since I said,
"I quit.
See you at the Oscars, bitches."
Come on, let's just get this over with.
"Let's get this over with."
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex?
I'm just...
I'm trying to lighten the mood.
I know.
Thank you.
Sorry.
It's just so humiliating.
So humiliating?
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory...?
I'm sorry.
I'll-I'll stop.
I'll stop.
Come on, don't look so sad.
You never know what's gonna happen.
Maybe tonight will be great.
Sweetie, I know you're trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it's making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you.
This isn't your car.
I know.
I thought we'd take yours.
I don't understand.
It's nothing fancy, but it'll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don't have to go back to waitressing.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Oh, my God.
I mean, you could say, "Thank you."
I did just buy you a car.
Mmm.
Look, I admit that it's odd that Rajesh didn't write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you'll see he's just a sweet, regular guy.
As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.
Hello, Emily.
Hello.
Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy.
Let me ask you something.
Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say,
"Hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?"
No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.
Uh, okay, that's a separate issue.
Let's put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
I'm leaving.
Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
You know, I think I'm just gonna go by myself.
Not my best first date.
Yeah, but not my worst, either.
(rumbling)
I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you!
I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!
(rumbling, rattling, passengers gasping)
If you weren't my friend, there'd be a hole in my life!
Thank you, Sheldon.
Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled.
But not as big.
(bell dings)
WOMAN:
The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign.
You're now free to move about the cabin.
It's over.
Yeah.
(both panting)
Should we stop holding hands now?
In a minute.
Okay, good.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Raj, your tag's sticking out.
Thank you.
That's the closest I've come to sex in, like, two years.
Now I feel a little gross.
You're only making it seem more real for me.
Hey, that's my wife.
If anyone's gonna make her feel gross about sex, it's me.
Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
How about Penny's depressing acting career?
Hey.
It's been a little tough, but Penny's following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.
Aw, thank you.
Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
Is that a real book?
I would totally read that book.
Can I borrow it when you're done'?
Well, I'll have you guys know
I turned down a part in a movie last week.
Why would you do that'?
Because it was crap.
It was a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
Serial Ape-ist?
I thought you died in that.
She does. 42 minutes in.
While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.
I have an eidetic memory.
I don't know what his problem is.
Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one.
They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
Am I missing something, or isn't that the part she was born to play?
♪ (THEME SONG PLAYS)
So are you really not gonna do this movie?
Well, I don't think it's the kind of part that's good for my career.
But don't a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?
Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep ever had to say,
"Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!"
If she did, it would be amazing.
That woman can do no wrong.
I don't know anything about show business, so if you think it's reasonable to turn down paid work and just bum through your savings,
I'm sure you know what you're doing.
I think we're gonna go.
Are you sure?
We were making fun of failed careers.
We didn't get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard's.
Hey, I work at the same university you do.
Yes, and Hawkeye's in the Avengers, but no one ever says, "Help, Hawkeye!"
Can I ask you something?
Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
I'm sure he does it out of love.
The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.
I think we're gonna go.
No, no.
This is not a fight.
I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you'd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it.
Now it's a fight.
Well, with that sorted out,
I'm happy to answer your question, Bernadette.
Howard started it.
I didn't do anything.
I was just sitting here.
I wasn't referring to this evening.
Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman.
And he called me C-BP-wee Herman.
(LAUGHING) Still funny.
That was ten years ago.
Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.
Really?
The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds.
That's funny!
I was there.
It was funny.
In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions.
To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny.
Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.
Thanks for walking me to my car.
Actually, ifs for both of us.
Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I'm a little freaked out by street gangs.
Why can't Raj find a girl?
The mystery continues.
I don't appreciate your sarcasm, but we've still got two blocks to go, so I'll put up with it.
Whatever happened with your online dating?
No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.
Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too.
Once, I even dropped in on my OB/GYN just to get some human contact.
It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.
What?
You've kissed, like, once in three years.
That's true.
Do whatever you want.
- Hey.
- Hello.
Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.
Really?
I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points.
You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn't hear the rest 'cause she took her bra off.
Very well.
(CLEARS THROAT)
How do you propose we move forward?
For starters, we could stop insulting each other.
That's a great idea.
And in the spirit of our new arrangement,
I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.
Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend.
They gave me two tickets.
Bernadette can't go.
You want to come with me?
You can visit your mom, and I'll show you around the space center.
I have one question.
Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you've made up wanted posters that have my face with a mustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?
No.
I'm glad because I would not have seen that coming.
Amy, I could use some help.
Let me guess.
There's an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating website and I was looking at this girl's profile.
She's amazing.
Oh, she's cute.
And smart.
Phi Beta Kappa.
And judging by her lack of Adam's apple, she's been female her entire life.
I like that in a woman.
Great, so what do you need me for?
Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.
- All right.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
"Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower."
Wow.
I know.
Powerful stuff, huh?
No.
You're supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.
Okay, I'm getting some mixed messages here.
Just say something normal like, "I saw your profile.
"Looks like we have a lot in common.
Let's get a cup of coffee sometime."
Yes. "Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips."
Or you just write it for me.
I'm not gonna pretend to be you.
I don't want you to pretend to be me.
You can be my online wingman.
Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.
Well, what would I say to her'?
Just tell her what I'm really like.
And, if you think it'll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar.
Use your own words.
Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
It's no problem.
ls everything okay?
I'm fine.
It's just some stomach medication for my trip.
There's the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.
Remember the old days when I would've said something dumb like, "Why?"
(ENGINE THUMPING)
Uh, that doesn't sound good.
Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
- Yes.
- Get ready to go down memory lane.
- Penny, your check engine...
- Yeah, I know ifs on, Sheldon!
Oh, no, no.
I cannot afford this right now.
Maybe it's just something minor.
(ENGINE BANGS, HISSES)
Oh, good news, the light just went out.
Are we playing individual or teams?
Teams are fun.
In that case, I'd like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.
But I'm always on Howard's team.
We're best friends.
The kind who finish each others...
I really don't think we do than
Do that!
See?
- Oh, hi.
- How'd it go at the mechanic?
Not great.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
Isn't it late to get plane tick...
Plane tickets?
Yeah.
- Will you please sto...
- Stop that?
Okay.
I don't know what to do.
My car threw a rod and ifs totaled.
I can't afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can't drive to auditions.
I'm so sorry.
I know it's a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?
I did.
I called them.
The part's gone.
They gave it to someone else.
Now that girl's gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
At least they talked about you on Letterman.
Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.
How?
Unlike me, you have a job.
I'm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress.
Like I will be for the rest of my life.
Leonard, would you wrap it up?
We're waiting on you.
I'm sorry, is the fact that my life's falling apart interfering with your board game?
It is.
You were wrong, friend Howard.
She completely understood.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey, you busy?
No.
What's up?
Have you heard back from Emily?
I have.
Great!
And?
And I'm afraid she doesn't think you're right for her.
I give you one simple thing to do.
Contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it!
I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn't write to her yourself.
She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.
I'm not too shy and passive.
You write her back and tell her I said that.
You know, when you have a second.
Look, I'll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.
What's happening tomorrow night'?
I'm meeting her for coffee.
What?
We emailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.
I find a girl I like, and you're stealing her'?
No.
We just ended up having a lot in common.
We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we're both hardcore into quilting.
Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart
That's Sheldon.
He says he'll be down in a minute.
- What are you doing?
- (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
He's not coming out until he sees proof you don't have an air freshener in your car.
This is gonna be a long weekend for you.
You're the reason I'm doing it!
I said to stop insulting each other.
I didn't tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
How do I know what you said?
Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
- Hello.
- Hey, buddy.
You excited for Texas?
Oh, very much so.
It's not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.
(GASPS) Who's the real astronaut?
- Buzz Aldrin.
- Oh.
Yay!
(BELL CHIMES)
Howard?
Howard?
Howard?
What now?
I have to go to the bathroom.
You just went to the bathroom.
I didn't use it because it didn't seem safe.
Despite all my emails, the toilet didn't have a seatbelt.
Well, it still doesn't.
I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.
Fine.
Why are you getting annoyed?
I'm trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.
- Like when?
- When?
How about in the car'?
I'm an astronaut, and you know it.
You just don't like admitting it, because you're jealous.
Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space.
Those astronauts were my heroes.
And when you got to go, it was hard for me.
Thank you.
Because it made me realize they'll just send anyone up there.
- Aren't you going to let me out?
- No.
But I still need to use the bathroom.
Here you go.
Be creative.
What's the matter'?
Scared of a little turbulence?
No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere.
I'm not scared at all.
Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.
Oh, this is nothing.
I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut.
(RUMBLING)
Okay, that was a big one.
I take it back.
I'm scared of turbulence!
I'm gonna need that bag back.
You sure you want to do this?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't I want to get my old job back?
It'll be fun to see everyone.
I haven't talked to them since I said, "I quit.
See you at the Oscars, bitches."
Come on, let's just get this over with.
"Let's get this over with."
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex?
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.
- I know.
Thank you.
- Sorry.
It's just so humiliating.
So humiliating?
Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory...?
I'm sorry.
I'll stop.
I'll slop.
Come on, don't look so sad.
You never know what's gonna happen.
Maybe tonight will be great.
Sweetie, I know you're trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but ifs making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you.
This isn't your car.
I know.
I thought we'd take yours.
I don't understand.
It's nothing fancy, but it'll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don't have to go back to waitressing.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Oh, my God.
I mean, you could say, "Thank you." I did just buy you a car.
Look, I admit that it's odd that Rajesh didn't write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you'll see he's just a sweet, regular guy.

Let me ask you something.
Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say,
"Hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?"
No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.
Okay, that's a separate issue.
Lets put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.
I'm leaving.
Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
You know, I think I'm just gonna go by myself.
Not my best first date.
Yeah, but not my worst, either.
I'm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you!
I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!
If you weren't my friend, there'd be a hole in my life!
Thank you, Sheldon.
Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled.
But not as big.
(BELL CHIMES)
WOMAN:
The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign.
You're now free to move about the cabin.
- It's over.
- Yeah.
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
Should we stop holding hands now?
- In a minute.
- Okay, good.
(English US
- SDH)
This is about Andreas.
Promise me you'll take care of the boy.
Your source "Sofia" is your brother.
All e-mails and files point to him.
- Abraham!
- No!
What's Daniel got to do with Abraham?
He's in my church screaming at a painting of Abraham's sacrifice.
This is Daniel's last farewell.
- You know Åge Haugen?
- Who?
- Haugen worked with Tom Lied.
- The self-made billionaire.
Nobody got rich that fast for no apparent reason.
The man you're looking for is not a Gekko, but a Gatsby, a gangster.
Haugen was blackmailed into committing suicide.
Blackmailed?
How?
He called that painting "Abraham".
It's our son.
Åge always feared for his safety.
Could this have something to do with your father?
And you?
- Who told you not to talk?
- Terje Hjorth.
The Minister of Justice...
Was the date added later?
It's not a date.
It's Genesis 22.10:
"To sacrifice your own son..."
22.10... it's a date.
It was the date when Daniel and Åge Haugen killed themselves.
Chapter 3:
THE DESCENT
When all this is explained, it will be over.
No.
This is just the beginning.
How can you say that?
Didn't you want to stay out of this?
- Watch Andreas.
- Where are you going?
To tell an ex-colleague she's involved.
- She doesn't know?
- No.
You have to make up beds for all three of us tonight.
He's old enough to sleep over by himself?
- And I need a key.
- You know where to find it.
Yeah, come on in.
Andreas, you take Peter's old room.
Eva, you take the guestroom.
I'll get towels and toothbrushes.
Then we'll have something to eat.
- Hello.
- Hello, Peter.
Inger Marie's asleep.
Could you please just tell her that Peter needs some help?
But she's asleep.
I can't...
Hello.
I need help.
I must show you something.
We don't work together now.
I won't and I'm not allowed.
It's just a trade-off.
I have to show you something now.
Your husband thinks you work too much?
My ex put his job above everything else.
I left him.
So I deserve to be told off.
But you can't be party to my private life.
Inger Marie...
Vibeke.
- Nice to meet you.
- Congratulations.
Didn't you search our newspaper's offices?
I forgot to say...
We worked a bit together since.
Yeah, I guess we've worked a bit together.
Who tipped you off about Åge Haugen?
- I've got many sources.
- Who?
You don't know.
I'll bet my job on it being one of these two names.
You know how to tempt a woman.
- There.
Now give her your PC.
- If I don't know it, how can she?
- E-mail and chat code.
- Can't you hack it?
Yeah, but I can ask too.
Why don't you go and chat, and leave me to it?
- How long did she put up with you?
- Why do you think we were together?
- Did you get dumped?
- It lasted three years.
Since I quit your department.
We've been digging into my brother's case.
We agreed that I was to be dumped.
You should try again.
Just change a little bit.
- Change the two most annoying things.
- And what two things might they be?
- I've got it!
- That's for you to find out.
The chat supplier's IP address.
Then I can track the address that mainly used that signature.
That person is...
- Yeah, but why?
- He wanted to be found out.
- But why did he kill himself?
- My brother was my anonymous source.
- Your brother?
- They both did the same thing.
No one investigates a suicide.
- They wanted to be found out?
- Yes.
- And they used us as...
- Their executioners.
- They had to kill themselves.
- Why did he mail me in his own name?
- What's this attachment?
- I couldn't open it.
Can you?
No, it's a corrupted file.
Yes...
Well, I have to go.
Will you drive me home?
What about our deal?
- Meet me at noon tomorrow.
- What for?
- You'll see tomorrow.
- How generous of you.
Peter, could you stay a while?
I'd like to go through this.
I'll take a cab.
- See how jealous she was?
- Still conceited?
That corrupt file is video-encoded.
I can open that easily.
- You copied it?
- I copied her entire hard disk.
I feel there's something seriously amiss with that woman.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Whose child was that?
I have no idea.
You have to go to Andreas.
Come with me.
It's the children that are threatened, not me.
Get going now.
Go!
In the kitchen, the living-room, the library, landing and hallways...
There are 14 pictures of you here, Peter, and only one of Daniel.
One picture.
What's the matter?
I don't think we have to stay here.
Hello.
No one can tell if someone's going to shoot themselves.
They'd stop them.
- You talked to VG?
- Yeah.
- We need a plan for Friday.
- Don't waste your time.
Just trying to be prepared.
You don't know what might happen before Friday.
Like what?
"MINISTER WAS HAUGEN'S BEST MAN"
- OK, VG has chosen another angle.
- That's not news, it's the easy way.
- Do you know more than us?
- Not yet.
What are we going to do?
- This is why they sell more papers.
- Our circulation is bigger.
Out!
On second thoughts, stand by the door.
They don't have to sack good writers or have them buy their own coffee.
I was told we had a lead on this story, but he was best man?
- We have more important stuff.
- Did we know this?
Of course.
That's why I don't work there.
We have a proper story.
- What do we have now?
- We'll have it soon.
This has links to Verås's suicide, which gives us the biggest scoop...
- You talked to Peter?
Don't be naive.
- But he pointed out...
The minister is our priority.
3,000% focus on him.
That's what matters.
The minister always beats finance.
There's no conflict here.
Lied and the minister.
Haugen and Verås.
I think we should keep our options open.
As long as you get your priorities right.
And stay away from Peter.
The lawyers will handle him.
Now get out.
Find out what Peter does and doesn't know.
- Peter doesn't trust me anymore.
- I'm sure you'll get it out of him.
We shouldn't have left him at Tore's.
No...
I agree.
But we don't have any other choice.
Hello?
What do you know about Abraham?
Abraham was the ancestor of Jews, Christians and Muslims.
Then there's no need to snoop in my personal stuff to learn more.
- No...
- I should've warned you.
I am a priest, I live alone, and I'm programmed to use big words.
Capital letters.
Breakfast will be served soon.
Forgive an old man.
I'm stubborn, not grumpy.
"You're made to live alone," my wife used to say.
- There you are.
- I'm sure it was well meant.
Why did you leave Peter's room untouched and not my dad's?
- What did your dad tell you?
- Nothing.
It was mostly a non-subject.
Though I knew that you were stubborn.
I never managed to make it up to him before I lost him...forever.
Make up for what?
I will tell you when we know each other better.
These things take time.
Daniel took everything with him when he moved.
He was angry...
Very angry.
That's why there are mementos of Peter here and not of your dad.
There.
I filmed you, now I'll press "Send".
You want to call the police?
We are the police.
Why did Haugen choose to cry on your shoulder?
I protect even my dead sources.
He contacted you between 12:00 and 4:00?
The thing is, he had no mobile coverage.
- He must've had a hi-tech phone.
- He was here, being questioned.
- He had no equipment, he was filmed.
- And we think you're full of shit.
- Or we don't believe your statement.
- That's not my problem.
- Why should we believe you?
- When we know you're full of shit?
- Who took that?
- Who's the woman?
- A source.
Unconnected to this.
- She's your sister-in-law.
She's a source.
And she shouldn't suffer because Haugen was sick.
- She doesn't deserve it.
- That's up to us.
Do what the fuck you want to me, but if you pull her in to make news, you'll get more attention than you bargained for.
Are you going to give us a yellow card?
You work in Sports.
You forget to ask the important question.
- Which is?
- Who took the picture?
Who said we don't know?
You've got enemies sending photos to CID's biggest celebrity hunters.
- Come here.
- Why do you suddenly care?
My gut feeling is that you're a lousy boyfriend, but no crook.
Those two aren't blessed with gut feelings.
- What do you think?
- I don't tell journalists that.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I searched all night.
No match for any missing children.
I extended the search to Europe.
Open the mails that Haugen sent to Inger Marie.
Check the time of the mails and video.
He couldn't have sent them.
He was being questioned by the police and had no PC or phone.
He couldn't have sent them.
- But why should...?
- Somebody's pretending to be Haugen.
To give us more information than Haugen planned to.
His mail account's been used after he died.
By who?
I can't see by who, only that it was used and this was sent.
A mail fragment.
A "yes", but not what the question was.
- Can you find out?
- With time.
Oh, shit!
A thank-you kiss for your great brain.
- Can I tell Inger Marie?
- No!
Exactly that.
Notes, documents, e-mails, transcripts.
- Search and read, search and read.
- And you?
I'm going to search in places where you can't.
- You could've changed jackets.
- Slag me off later.
We're meeting Tom Lied.
He worked with Haugen five years ago.
I think they got rich on the banking crisis.
- They had government insiders.
- The Minister of Justice?
Lied is smart.
I'll do the talking.
We have a 12:30 appointment.
- 12:30?
- I assumed you'd be late.
Your 12:30 appointment is here.
Do pretty girls make you blush?
- I don't recall Lied being handsome.
- The PR manager.
Former DN news desk.
Lied tripled his salary.
Hello, Peter.
Inger Marie, congratulations.
- I'll set up the agenda.
- Agenda?
- You've followed Paragon for days?
- Not followed...
Alarm bells ring when your ilk drop by the town hall.
People not liking my boss doesn't mean he's done anything wrong.
And that will be within 40 days...
My God, how glorious!
Two journalists!
- I brought Peter Verås, if that's OK?
- Of course.
Congratulations.
I'll just get changed.
Could you look after our guests, Fredrik?
- A drink?
Coffee?
Tea?
- Coffee.
Coffee.
Good!
I'll have a drink myself.
Are you OK?
Did you get coffee?
- Yes.
This is a nice office.
- Thanks.
- Do you need another PR manager?
- Send me your CV.
This was to be a portrait interview, but your name has come up lately.
My name often does.
It's tragic, of course.
How do we portray me fairly?
I could write something myself.
Worth a try, as you brought a sports journalist.
Or are you taking photos?
- You're from Fredrikstad?
- Ørmen, outside Fredrikstad.
- Same thing to a Vinderen girl.
- Not many would check me out.
Oh, they would, they just wouldn't tell you.
- Wow, cakes and stuff.
- Oh, yeah.
There you are.
So you're from the outside, you said?
Outside Fredrikstad and the outside here.
- It's my great weakness and strength.
- Strength in what way?
Åge Haugen, RIP, taught me one thing:
Norway is a small country.
- But he was wrong.
- Wrong?
Please don't repeat every word I say.
He thought that if you know someone, you know the shortcuts.
You don't need shortcuts in a small country, but an overview.
- How do you get that?
What's...?
- The method?
The secret?
The talent?
You've had an impressive career progression.
Thanks.
There's no secret.
I've got an overview.
And I do the opposite to most people.
Because they're mostly wrong.
Accept the status quo, and you'll only benefit the few.
Who are they?
The devil's biggest trick is to make everybody think that he doesn't exist.
- My favourite film.
- It didn't disclose its sources.
It was Baudelaire.
But I think he was wrong too.
Do you like French poets, Vinderen girl?
Could we have an insight into who invested in Lied Invest 5 years ago?
Is the portrait interview over?
The start-up capital.
You suddenly had a lot of money...
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yes.
- Me too.
- I thought you didn't have any.
- I said I don't have a secret method.
- Let's ask a question he will answer.
- But what happened to Haugen's plans?
- Let him rest in peace.
- Did you know his brother?
- Daniel?
Propriety himself?
No.
It seems I wasn't the only one.
What is it about men?
Yeah, what is it about men?
I have to take this, sorry.
- What do you want?
- You asked me to call you.
My brother and Haugen knew each other.
What did they have in common?
Money, I'd say.
An unfortunate take on money.
- Cardboard boxes, I tell you...
- Are you sure?
Sure?
Yeah, cardboard boxes and documents and...
- Mail it to me.
- I've got nothing.
Great, thanks.
I'm sorry.
I have to look at this attachment I just got.
Yes, here it says:
"Somebody in a position with connections in government,
"with insight into the banking crisis, cooperated with Haugen."
- Is that your method too?
- What?
- To cooperate with government people?
- No.
I don't deal with politicians because they don't understand politics.
If they don't understand their own business, how could they get mine?
- So you don't know anything?
- No.
No ties?
What I do is difficult.
So if we found otherwise, you'd be surprised?
Horrified.
What were we doing there?
He revealed nothing.
- I made him feel safe.
- And why not?
- He lied and denied everything.
- Lied about what?
Haugen and Lied cooperated illegally with a minister during the crisis.
- You can prove this?
- Soon.
- By pretending to get mail?
- I'll find proof.
When we find it...
- If you find it...
- This is your fault.
- I've got three days because of you.
- You claim falsely to have proof.
If I find it, we have it on tape that he's lying and denying everything.
Listen...
What's happened to you?
If you think I'm stupid, Peter, you should know that I act stupid.
Of course.
I don't know who's pretending to be Haugen.
But I know where they'll be tonight.
I found mail fragments.
The sender accepts an invitation to the party of that philanthropist tonight.
The person who sent the video of that child will be at that party.
No.
No, no, no way.
The man I think blackmailed Daniel and Haugen will be at that party.
I can't bring you with me.
I'll just be seen as Daniel's widow.
It's taken five years to move on.
For Andreas's sake?
Over 100 guests are invited.
- All you have is half an e-mail.
- That's a lot more than I had.
May I have a look at some of your books?
Looking at books is one of the nicest things in life.
- Why did Dad get into finance?
- To annoy me.
But God was the first economist, so I forgave him.
- Though above all, he was a socialist.
- Dad?
- God.
- Yeah...
I'm going to the library.
Do you want anything?
No, I've got enough to read here.
- You alone won't have the overview.
- I just hope to trigger something.
- Inger Marie could help you.
- That won't be possible.
- But Eva's going.
- I could come and help.
No need.
I'll just look for some ripples in the water.
- There may be none.
- Nothing escapes your eagle eye?
- I've smelt burning fuses before.
- And you've lit some.
- Don't create any upsets.
- Upsets?
Wrong word.
I have faith in you.
Seventh Commandment: "Thou shalt not steal." Those are for visitors.
- You can't go up there now.
- He'll see me.
- Hello.
You didn't answer my call.
- Budget time.
They all want more, and we have less than ever.
I need the number of the painter responsible for the donated picture.
- The one your son donated?
- Celebrities like him are unlisted.
- Have you got it?
- Yes.
But why dig that up now?
Let's call it an attempt to understand my own family.
MY MEMORIES
- Hello?
- I think I found what you wanted.
- Signatures?
- Yeah, Lied and Hjorth.
- Hjorth?
- The minister.
Yes, I know...
- Get the documents out of Paragon.
- We have photos.
No, I need the originals.
Borrow them.
- The Dragon's here.
- Be creative.
I don't deal with politicians.
They don't understand politics.
- He's lying in print.
- In mono.
- It'll be printed black on white.
- Lied and the minister...
- I planned to vote for him.
- Like all of Norway.
We have this the day before the party convention.
- I'm so excited I'll go into labour!
- Not in here, please!
Well, look at this...
Eva, you came.
Well, there are worse escorts, though not in Norway.
How does Mathiesen like you mingling with high society?
There are worse people to mingle with, though not in...
Please don't ruffle any feathers on a night like this.
I'll be good.
I'll set a new standard of politesse.
That sounds boring.
I don't mind minor scandals.
See you.
Welcome.
Say what you want, it helped to make them feel the heat.
It's crucial you keep your mouths shut.
This will be printed in 2 days.
- The minister will be confronted...?
- Tomorrow morning.
As if this wasn't enough...
This is a picture from an Italian paper a year ago.
- What's this?
- A visit to Rome by the minister.
It's outside the official programme.
Yes, that is Yvonne Haugen.
- With Mister Morality.
- This won't precede our story?
- It's not related to our story.
- Two front pages won't hurt.
- This won't be printed tomorrow?
- We haven't worked weeks for this!
- I said I'd keep Yvonne out of this.
- Who cares?
The photo was sent to me.
It's about politics and morals.
A politician with no morals.
You can't write it yet.
The minister must have his say, meanwhile...
"Meanwhile"?
Fuck it, we're not going to turn into a tabloid rag!
Put the two things together.
It's fucking simple!
First the crime, then the moral of the story.
Unfaithfulness isn't news, but if you can pin one thing on him, you can show the flaws in his character.
- Others may have this photo.
- Then it's not exclusive.
If you let Jensen loose with this, media history will savage you.
There's a right order to do things in, and a fucking bad one!
I haven't gone for Jensen's suggestion.
I wanted to air it first.
You have to air suggestions before making a decision.
I agree with you.
You write the story as it stands.
Nobody will use the Rome story to prove their point.
Get out now.
- See any guilty parties?
- All of them.
But maybe not the ones we want.
So I may have to pull a fast one.
Being outrageous.
Twice on the same day!
- That's a lot.
- It may be every day now.
Are you in love?
A distant admirer?
It's a deep and genuine affection I hope will be reciprocated.
Then you must stop seeing others.
And you must give.
This is a charity function.
Give what is in a journalist's heart to give.
- That's not much.
- I'll take what I'm given.
Yeah.
And more, I hear.
Hello?
Hello?
Andreas?
This is a joyful day for us!
I like friends.
And I like up-hill struggles.
But I don't find enough of either, which is bad for my character.
However, let's appreciate what is of real value: friendship.
Please let me introduce my newest addition to the endangered species "Friends of Fredrik"...
Tom Lied!
He'll ring my bell today!
Theodor.
That's the new nickname given to me by Fredrik.
The cuddly teddy Theodor.
Raise your glasses to Fredrik and tonight's charitable cause, the children's village in Malawi.
For every krone you donate, I'll donate two.
I've already donated 10 million, so we must find more villages.
Here's to Fredrik, here's to tonight.
Cheers!
Andreas, you're not here.
I'm driving out to find you.
Please call me.
Well...
I have been asked for a donation by Tom Theodor.
Loyalty was mentioned, and in this company I'll come up short, both in generosity and loyalty.
What would I give to a good cause?
Loyalty is not about something good.
Real loyalty is to do something for somebody you wouldn't normally do.
That is, to sacrifice something of yourself or somebody else.
Real loyalty is to cross your own boundaries from light into darkness.
And speaking of the many gifts of God...
Abraham one of God's favourites, was asked to sacrifice his son to show his loyalty to God.
That's a lot, Teddy Boy.
But was that without anything in return?
Did Abraham get "kickbacks", as you call them?
He entered into a pact with God:
he would only accept one God.
Then his family would take control of a land of milk and honey.
And he would get money for sacrificing his son's life.
Money.
A child.
I don't ask what you will sacrifice.
That's up to each individually.
But for whom?
Peter!
I'll say like my mother used to say:
I liked the speech.
- I felt a calling.
- Make another one, or I'll get bored.
Cheers.
COME TO THE KITCHEN IN 10 MINUTES
I know who you are.
Your brother was a thief.
A stupid, common thief.
Who killed himself because he was a coward.
OK.
Is that what you wanted to tell me?
It seems somebody should tell you that you're not wanted.
You're pathetic, that's what you are.
Obviously not only pathetic, as you seem provoked.
It's dangerous to pretend to know things.
- People can die from that.
- Who am I talking to?
I just wanted to warn you against going public again.
So you're here?
He's calling from the landline here.
There are so many weirdoes here.
You must have an opinion.
- Or you wouldn't have phoned me.
- You're out to lunch.
- Where's the landline?
- Top floor by the canteen.
The link between Haugen and Daniel 5 years ago?
The video you sent.
Who was the child?
There's a reason you sent that to me in Haugen's name.
You have to go back further, 25 years, to understand this evil.
And what was that?
I know nothing about this.
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I got him!
His car, at least.
I took a picture of the car.
It's been leased.
Through a company, probably.
I have to go home to find out.
Peter?
- She's with us.
- Us?
You, us, we...
Peter, help her out.
Vibeke and I were together for 3 years.
She investigated your husband.
If you wait here, I'll go and find out if anyone knows who owns the car.
Hello.
There's someone who wants to talk to you.
Come with me.
One of the most important things money can buy.
Violence.
Why is nobody doing their job?
I expect someone to get in touch.
You were only supposed to call in an emergency.
This isn't one.
You don't seem to realise how serious this is, judging by the last two days.
I called you now, didn't I?
Yes.
And you said I should be doing my job.
My job...
Do you know what that is?
My job isn't to do what you don't want.
It's to do what you can't even imagine.
Horrible, gruesome things.
Don't you worry about my job, you don't have the stomach for it.
Don't you have children to take care of?
This is Andreas.
You have to promise to look after the boy.
Sophia, the source.
It's your brother, you were in contact with.
It was him.
- Abraham!
- What did Abraham have to do with Daniel?
He's screaming at the picture of Abraham's sacrifice in my church.
- This was Daniel's last message.
- You know who Age Haugen is?
Haugen worked with Tom Lied.
No one have got so rich so quickly without explanation.
You're looking for Norway's Gatsby.
A gangster.
Age was pressured to kill himself.
He's called Abraham.
He's our son.
- Age was afraid something would happen to him.
- I don't know who's behind it.
It's something to do with your father.
And you.
- Who said you can't talk to anyone?
- Terje Hjorth.
- The Minister of Justice.
- The date.
Was it added afterwards?
There's a Bible somewhere.
The biggest sacrifice in the Christian faith.
- To sacrifice his own son.
- 22.10. is a date.
It's the date when Daniel and Age Haugen took their own lives.
We'll find an explanation, and then it'll be over.
- This is just the beginning.
- How can you say that?
Shouldn't you stay out of it?
Take care of Andreas.
I'll ask a colleague, she'll help with it.
- She doesn't know about it?
- No.
You must arrange accommodation for three persons.
- If he can't sleep anywhere by himself?
- So, I have a spare key.
Yes, come in..
Andreas stays in Peter's old room.
Eva stays in the guest room.
I'll get towels and toothbrushes.
Then we'll get some food afterwards.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Inger Marie's asleep.
Okay.
Could you tell her:
Peter needs help?
Yes, but she's asleep.
I need help.
There's something you must see.
- I won't and I'm not allowed to.
- This is just an exchange.
Now.
- Do you think your husband worked a lot?
- My ex put work ahead of everything.
I left him, so now I endure the gossip.
But you aren't invited in my personal life.
Inger Marie.
Vibeke.
- Nice.
- Congratulations.
Are you involved in the newspaper's investigation?
- We worked together a bit after that.
- Yes, we worked a bit together.
Who tipped you off about Age Haugen?
- There were many sources.
- Who?
Don't you know.
I bet my job, it is one of these two.
You know how to tempt a weak woman.
- So you give her your PC.
- How will she find out?
- E-mail and chat code?
- Can't you just hack in?
Can't you chat?
I need some rest.
How long did she look after you?
- A bit.
- Did you get dumped or something?
It lasted three years.
And then we dug into my brother's case.
We agreed.
I should be dumped.
You can change a bit.
Remove the two things that annoy you most.
- What are those two things?
- I got it.
- You have to find out yourself.
- I found the IP address.
Then I can trace the address mainly used sign in.
And that person is...
- But why?
- So he'd be revealed.
- But why did he take his life?
- My brother tipped me off anonymously.
- Your brother?
- They both did the same thing.
No one investigates a suicide.
They didn't want to be arrested?
And then they used us to...
Be their executioners.
They had to take their lives.
Why did he send e-mails to me in his own name?
Age Haugen?
- What is this attachment?
- I couldn't open it.
It was a corrupt file.
Yes.
I must go.
Will you drive me home?
- What's the deal?
- Meet me tomorrow at 12:00.
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you in the morning.
If you have to leave?
I'd like to go through what we have.
I'll take a taxi.
- So how jealous was she?
- Still conceited?
The corrupt file is a video.
But I can open it up.
- Did you copy it?
- The entire drive.
There's something seriously wrong with that woman.
Daddy?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Whose child was it?
I have no idea.
You must go to Andreas.
- You need to go to them.
- The children are threatened, not me.
Get off.
Go!
In the kitchen, the living room, library, stairs, hallway downstairs and upstairs...
There are 14 pictures of you here, and the only one with Daniel.
One picture.
- Why is that?
- I don't think we should stay here.
Hello.
No one can anticipate someone would shoots himself.
It shouldn't have happened.
Spoke to Times World?
We'll work on some scenarios for Friday.
Don't waste resources.
You don't know what can happen between now and Friday.
Like what?
- Times World catches up from another side.
- That's not news.
- You know something we don't?
- Not yet.
- That's why they sell so many newspapers.
- They need to have a larger circulation.
Out!
Or stay there by the door.
You can't fire the clever people and ask employees to pay for their own coffee.
We sat in the driver's seat in this matter.
And he's the man?
- Do we want to?
- Of course.
- We have an investigation, not that sort of news.
- What can we do now?
The case has parallels to Veras' suicide...
You've talked to Peter.
Don't be naive, Inger Marie.
The Minister must be top priority.
3000% focus.
The Minister turns it into a financial investigation.
There's no contradiction here.
Lied and the Minister.
Haugen and Veras.
- We should keep all options open.
- Just keep your priorities in order.
But stay away from Peter.
He has lawyers to take care of.
- Find out what Peter knows.
- Peter doesn't trust me anymore.
You can get enough out of him.
We shouldn't let him stay at Tore.
No.
I agree.
But we have no choice.
Hello?
What do you know about Abraham?
Abraham is the ancestor of Jews, Christians and Muslims.
Then there's no reason to mess with my stuff to find out more.
I should have given you a warning.
I'm a priest, a recluse.
Programmed to use big words.
Uppercase.
Soon it will be time for breakfast.
Forgive an old man.
I'm weird.
You were born to live alone, my wife always said.
Surely she thought that.
Why did you keep Peter's room as is, but not my father's?
- What did your father tell you?
- Nothing.
You were a non-issue.
I though that was because you were weird.
It never worked out well between us.
Before I lost him forever.
What never worked out?
I'll tell you when we know each other better.
Daniel took everything and he moved out.
He was angry.
Therefore this reminds me of Peter, and not of your father.
Now I just have to press to send this.
Are you calling the police?
We are the police.
Why did Haugen cry on your pillow?
- I won't talk about my sources.
- He contacted you between 12:00 and 16:00?
He had no coverage.
- He probably had more sophisticated equipment.
- He sat here for questioning.
- Without a phone.
Video on.
- We think you're full of shit.
We don't believe your explanation.
That's not my problem.
- Why should we believe you?
- Once we know you're full of shit?
- Who took the picture?
- Who's the woman?
- It's a source.
- It's your sister-in-law.
Haugen was a sick man, but she shouldn't suffer for that.
She doesn't deserve that.
If you drag her in just to make a fucking big show, you'll get more attention than you can dream of.
When will you give us a yellow card?
You forgot to ask the most important question:
Who took the picture?
Who said we don't know that?
Someone wants to harm you.
They are the two biggest celebrity hunters in CID.
- Why this concern?
- You're bad at relationships, but not necessarily a criminal because of that.
- What do you think?
- I won't talk to reporters.
Hello.
I've been looking all night.
No photos of that child as missing.
I expanded the search to all Europe.
Open the emails Inger Marie got from Haugen and check the times.
And the video.
It can't be sent by him.
He was being interrogated by the police.
It can't have been sent by him.
- Why would...?
- Someone pretend they were Haugen.
Someone wanted to give us more information than Haugen intended.
- The email account was used after his death.
- By whom?
I only get up to the account used, and when it was sent.
- Accepted, but not what.
- Can we find out?
- In a bit.
- Damn!
Your delicious brain deserves praise.
Can I tell Inger Marie?
Yes.
You should examine all the notes, documents, emails, and transcriptions.
- What are you doing?
- Exploring places where you can't go.
Hello.
You couldn't have changed the jacket?
Tom Lied cooperated with Haugen.
I think they earned enormous sums during the banking crisis because they had insight into the government policy.
Lied is smart, so let me talk.
- Hello.
Yes?
- We have an appointment at 12:30.
- I figured you were too late.
- 01:30 appointment here.
Are you embarrassed by pretty girls, Peter?
- I didn't remember he was so handsome.
- He's the PR manager.
Former desk manager.
Hello, Peter.
Nice.
Inger Marie.
Oy!
Congratulations.
I put it on the agenda.
You concentrated on Paragon recently.
An alarm goes off whenever you pass Radhuskaia.
Just because people don't like my boss, doesn't mean he did anything wrong.
OMG, how nice!
Two journalists.
- Peter.
- Tom.
- I'm with Peter Veras.
Ok?
- Of course.
Congratulations.
I just have to change first.
Would you take care of our guests?
- Would you like something to drink?
- Coffee, please.
Good.
I'll also have something to drink.
Hello.
Is it okay?
You got coffee and...
So glad you came here, then.
- No place for your PR Manager?
It was to be a private interview.
But now you mention it.
I'll take care of it.
How do we finally get a close and accurate to producing my personality?
You've included a sports journalist.
Or do you want to take a picture?
- You are from Fredrikstad?
- Ormen, outside of Fredrikstad.
But Vinderen girls like you can't distinguish the difference.
- Cake and stuff.
- Yeah.
- You were on the outside, were you?
- On the outside in Fredrikstad.
And here.
- It's my great weakness and strength.
- Strength?
Age Haugen taught me one thing:
Norway is a small country.
But he was wrong.
- Wrong?
- Don't repeat everything I say.
He thought if you knew someone, you had found a shortcut.
- But you need perspective.
- How do you get that?
What is...?
- The method?
- The secret?
The talent?
You've had impressive expansion in recent years.
I have an overview and that's the opposite of what most people do.
If one accepts the status quo, you only work for the interests available.
Some say the devil's trick is to convince everyone he doesn't exist.
- My favourite movie.
- The film wasn't honest about the sources.
It was Baudelaire.
But I think he was wrong too.
Do you like French poets, then?
A Vinderen girl?
Is it possible to gain insight into who invested in "Lied Invest"?
- Is the private interviewed over?
- Start-up capital?
- You did have a great deal of money.
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
- I didn't think you had any.
- I have a secret method.
- Ask a question he'd answer.
I'm trying to figure out what were Age Haugen's plans.
- You knew his brother?
- Daniel?
Veritable Truth itself?
No.
There were several who didn't think so.
- What is it with men?
- Yes, what is it with men?
I have to take this.
Sorry.
Yes, what is it?
- It's you who asked me to call.
- Oh yes, you say it.
My brother and Age Haugen knew each other.
What did they have in common?
Money, I think.
- There's a lot I could tell...
- Are you quite sure?
Safe?
Cardboard boxes, papers...
Can't mail it over right away?
- Terrific.
Hello!
Sorry.
I just have to get up an attachment I had sent over.
Yes, here it is:
Someone with a position in the government apparatus, with invaluable insight into the banking crisis, was Age Haugen's partner.
Is it also your method?
- What?
- To cooperate with people in government?
No.
I never cooperate with politicians.
They don't understand politics.
Then they hardly understand what I do.
- You know anything?
- No.
No connections?
What I do, is difficult.
If we found out otherwise, would you be surprised?
Terrified.
What were we doing there?
He revealed nothing.
I got him to feel safe.
He lied so it flowed out of him.
Haugen, Lied and the Minister had an illicit relationship.
- Do you have any evidence?
- Soon.
I'll find documentation.
- But you haven't.
- When we find evidence...
- I have just three days.
- So you run with the proof you don't have?
I'll find it, we'll lose that he's lying.
He'll deny everything.
You?
What happened to you?
If you think I'm stupid, when I play dumb.
Of course.
I know where the person pretending to be Age Haugen, is tonight.
I found fragments of an email.
The sender confirmed the invitation.
In Treschow tonight.
Autumn Festival.
The person who sent a video of the child, will be at the party.
No.
It's not.
I think he pressured Daniel and Haugen at the party.
I can't go there with you.
I just became Daniel's widow.
For Andreas's sake.
Over 100 guests were invited.
And you have only half an email message.
That's all I have.
Mind if I look in the books?
Looking at books is the finest thing you can do with your life.
- Why did Dad start in business?
- To annoy me.
He managed to do that.
God was the first economist.
But he was first and foremost a socialist.
- Dad?
- God.
I'm going to the library.
Anything you want from there?
No.
I have enough to read.
- You're not hunting alone.
- Relax.
I hope to trigger something.
- Can't Inger Marie help you?
- She can't.
But Eva's here.
- I can come and help out.
- No.
- You should look for ripples in the water.
- Yes, you'll catch everything by yourself.
- I felt some nibbles before.
- Your job isn't to make me sick.
- Nausea?
- Wrong word.
I have faith.
7th commandment:
Thou shalt not steal.
They are for the guests.
- You can't go up now.
- He will see me.
Hello.
You didn't phone.
Budget negotiations.
Everyone wants more, but we have less than ever.
I have to get the phone number of the painter of the picture.
- The picture your son donated?
- Celebrities of his calibre clearly aren't in the phonebook.
Do you know?
I have it.
Why dig into it now?
Let's call it an attempt for his family to understand.
- Hello?
- We've found what you're looking for.
- Signatures?
- Yes.
Lied and Hjorth.
- The Minister.
- Yes, I know.
You must get hold of the documents.
We need the real ones.
You'll have to borrow them.
- The dragon is here.
- Be creative.
I've never cooperated with politicians...
- He's lying in black and white.
- In mono, you mean.
Lied and the Minister?
I considered voting for the party because of him.
That was the day before the congress.
- I think I'm going to give birth!
- Don't do it here.
No, see there.
Eva!
You came.
There aren't worse escorts, here in Norway.
What does Mathiesen think about you taking care of beautiful people?
- There are worse people to hang out with.
- Shower you with praise tonight.
I'll behave myself properly so it will set a new standard.
- I'm not opposed to small scandals.
- Tell me.
- Hello, hello.
- How nice.
This will help to embarrass him.
Now important it is to keep your mouth shut.
This will be in print in two days.
First, the Minister will have to confront it.
- In the morning.
- As if that wasn't enough...
A press photo from an Italian newspaper.
About a year ago.
The Minister was on a visit to Rome.
Outside his official program.
- It's Yvonne Haugen.
- Arm in arm with Mr. Morality.
- This shouldn't appear in print?
- It doesn't hurt to go out with two stories.
Shouldn't we publish it tomorrow?
I promised to keep Yvonne Haugen out of it.
The image was sent to me.
This is politics and morality.
You need to talk to the minister and get his version.
- Meanwhile...
- In the meantime?
We shouldn't become a damn gossip sheet!
You have to see this in context.
First, take focus on the offense, then you can follow up with morality.
You can snag him with this first, then you can show the weakness of his character.
The others may also have the photo?
If you let Jensen get away with this, no newspaper will show you any mercy.
There's a correct procedure, and this is a fucking poor one.
I haven't endorsed Jensen's proposal.
I wanted to hear it first.
You must listen to the proposal before you decide.
I agree with you.
Print the issues as they stand, so no need to use the newspaper story to get the point across.
- Can someone be guilty?
- That's all.
But maybe not the ones we're looking for.
I should probably take a familiar tone.
Self-incriminating.
Twice in the same day.
Quite a lot.
- It comes forth every day.
- Sudden smitten?
Admiration from afar:
A real and raw infatuation, I hope, is reciprocated.
When you need to stop hitting others.
And you must give something.
This is charity.
- Leave it to a journalist to have a heart.
- There aren't many.
- I take what I can get.
- You're both a little more than that, too.
Hello!
Hello, Andreas?
This is a happy day for us.
I like friends.
And challenges.
But experiencing little of both.
It's not good for my character.
But we appreciated what's really of value: friendship.
Let me introduce my latest additions to the endangered species list
Frederick's friends.
Tom Lied!
He gets the bell today.
Theodor.
My new nickname.
I received from Fredrik.
Teddy bear Theodor.
Raise your glasses!
Cheers for Fredrik and this evenings charity: children's village in Malawi!
For every kroner you donate, I'll match it twice.
I gave 10 million, so we have enough to establish several villages.
Cheers for Fredrik!
Cheers for this evening!
Andreas, you weren't here.
I drove out looking for you.
Call me back, please.
Yes...
I was requested to thank Tom, Theodor.
Loyalty was mentioned.
I'll come to the point for you shortly.
What am I willing to sacrifice for a good cause?
Loyalty isn't about doing good.
You show loyalty when you do something for someone you wouldn't normally do.
So sacrifice something of yours or someone else's.
True loyalty is to go beyond your limits, from light to dark.
And speaking of God's many gifts.
Abraham... one of God's favourites, was asked to sacrifice his son out of loyalty to God.
And there's lot of that, teddy bear father?
But this was no reciprocal service?
Did Abraham get kickbacks, as you say?
He made his covenant with God.
He should worship just one God and his family would prevail in a country overflowing with milk and honey.
He would get money for sacrificing his son's life.
Money for a child.
My question to you isn't what you want to sacrifice.
That's an individual choice.
But for whom?
Peter?
As my mother always said to me:
I think it was a nice sermon.
Drink up, otherwise it's boring here.
Cheers!
I know who you are.
Your brother was a thief.
A silly, simple thief who killed himself because he was a coward.
Is that what you want to tell me?
It seems someone has to tell you, you're not wanted.
You are pathetic.
It's what you are.
Obviously, not only just that, because you appear provoked.
It's dangerous to pretend you know something you don't.
- People can die from that.
- Who is this?
I warn you against going out in public, like you're doing now.
From a land-line.
He's here.
There are so many weird people here.
You must have had a meaning.
- You're way out there.
- Is there a land-line here?
- Top floor, in the cafeteria.
What was the relationship between Haugen and Daniel five years ago?
The video you sent me?
Who was the child?
Why did you send me the video?
You need to look further back.
25 years to understand the mess.
- And what was that?
- I know nothing about this.
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I got him.
The car, at least.
I took photos of the car.
It was leased.
Surely by a company.
But I must go home to find out.
Peter!
- Hello!
- She's with us.
- Us?
- Yeah, you.
Us.
We.
- Peter, help her.
- We've been together for three years.
She investigated your husband.
Wait here, I'll see if anybody knows who owns the car.
- Hello.
- I have someone who wants to talk to you.
One of the most important things you can buy for the money is violence.
Why doesn't this work?
I expected someone to contact me.
You should only call in an emergency, and this isn't an emergency.
I don't know if you realize how serious this is, what we started.
- I called just now...
- Yes.
And told me to do my job.
My job.
Do you know what it is?
My job isn't to do what you don't want to, but what you can't imagine.
Strange and terrible things.
Don't worry about my job.
I can stomach it.
Don't you have children to take care of?
This is Andreas.
You have to promise to look after the boy.
Sophia, the source.
It's your brother, you were in contact with.
It was him.
- Abraham!
- What did Abraham have to do with Daniel?
He's screaming at the picture of Abraham's sacrifice in my church.
- This was Daniel's last message.
- You know who Age Haugen is?
Haugen worked with Tom Lied.
No one have got so rich so quickly without explanation.
You're looking for Norway's Gatsby.
A gangster.
Age was pressured to kill himself.
He's called Abraham.
He's our son.
- Age was afraid something would happen to him.
- I don't know who's behind it.
It's something to do with your father.
And you.
- Who said you can't talk to anyone?
- Terje Hjorth.
- The Minister of Justice.
- The date.
Was it added afterwards?
There's a Bible somewhere.
The biggest sacrifice in the Christian faith.
- To sacrifice his own son.
- 22.10. is a date.
It's the date when Daniel and Age Haugen took their own lives.
We'll find an explanation, and then it'll be over.
- This is just the beginning.
- How can you say that?
Shouldn't you stay out of it?
Take care of Andreas.
I'll ask a colleague, she'll help with it.
- She doesn't know about it?
- No.
Arrange accommodation for three persons.
- So he can't sleep away on his own
- And I need a spare key.
Yes, come in..
Andreas stays in Peter's old room.
Eva stays in the guest room.
I'll get towels and toothbrushes.
Then we'll get some food afterwards.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Inger Marie's asleep.
Okay.
Could you tell her:
Peter needs help?
Yes, but she's asleep.
I need help.
There's something you must see.
- I won't and I'm not allowed to.
- This is just an exchange.
Now.
- Does your husband think you work too much?
- My ex put work ahead of everything.
I left him, so now I have to endure experience the same.
But into my personal life you're not invited.
Inger Marie.
Vibeke.
- Nice.
- Congratulations.
Are you involved in the newspaper's investigation?
- We have worked together a bit after that.
- Yes, we have worked together a bit.
Who tipped you off about Age Haugen?
- There are many sources.
- Who?
You don't know.
I bet my job, it is one of these two.
You know how to tempt a weak woman.
- Give her your PC.
- How will she find out?
- E-mail and chat password?
- Can't you just hack in?
Can you just chit-chat?
I need some time.
How long did she keep out with you?
Did you get dumped?
For three years.
And then we dug into my brother's case.
It was mutual.
That I should be dumped.
Change a bit.
Remove the two most annoying things about you.
- What are those two things?
- I have him.
- You have to find out yourself.
- I found the IP address.
Then I can trace the address that is used in the signature.
And the person is...
- But why?
- He wanted to be revealed.
- But why did he take his life?
- My brother was my anonymous tipper.
- Your brother?
- They both did the same thing.
No one investigates a suicide.
They wanted to be caught?
And then they used us to...
Be their executioners.
They had to take their lives.
Why did he send e-mails to me in his own name?
Age Haugen?
- What is this attachment?
- I couldn't open it.
The file is corrupt.
Yes.
I need to go.
Will you drive me home?
- What about the deal?
- Meet me tomorrow at 12:00.
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you in the morning.
Will you stay?
I'd like to go through what we have.
I'll take a taxi.
- Did you see how jealous she was?
- Still conceited?
The corrupt file is a video.
But I can open it.
- Did you copy it?
- The entire drive.
There's something seriously wrong with that woman.
Daddy?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Whose child was it?
I have no idea.
You must go to Andreas.
- You come with me.
- The children are under threat, not me.
Get off.
Go!
In the kitchen, the living room, library, stairs, hallway downstairs and upstairs...
There are 14 pictures of you here, and the only one with Daniel.
One picture.
- Why is that?
- I don't think we should stay here.
Hello.
Nobody can anticipate that someone will shoots himself.
Then wouldn't have happened.
Talked to Times World?
We're working on some scenarios for Friday.
Don't waste resources.
You don't know what can happen between now and Friday.
Like what?
- Times World catches up from another angle.
- That's not the news.
- You know something we don't?
- Not yet.
- That's why they sell so many newspapers.
- They do have a larger circulation.
Out!
Or stay there by the door.
You can't fire the clever people and ask employees to pay for their own coffee.
We were in the driver's seat in this case.
And then he's the best man?
- Did we know?
- Of course.
- We have a case, not tabloid news.
- What can we do now?
The case has parallels to Veras' suicide...
You've talked to Peter.
Don't be naive, Inger Marie.
The Minister must be top priority.
3000% focus.
The Minister trumps finance always.
There's no contradiction here.
Lied and the Minister.
Haugen and Veras.
- We should keep all options open.
- Just keep your priorities in order.
But stay away from Peter.
Him our lawyers will take care of.
- Find out what Peter knows.
- Peter doesn't trust me anymore.
You'll get it out of him.
We shouldn't let him stay at Tore.
No.
I agree.
But we have no choice.
Hello?
What do you know about Abraham?
Abraham is the ancestor of Jews, Christians and Muslims.
Then there's no reason to mess with my stuff to find out more.
I should have given you a warning.
I'm a priest, a recluse.
Programmed to use big words.
Uppercase.
It's breakfast soon.
Forgive an old man.
I'm odd.
You were born to live alone, my wife always said.
She probably meant it well.
Why did you keep Peter's room as is, but not my father's?
- What did your father tell you?
- Nothing.
You were a non-issue.
I though it was because you were strange.
I couldn't work it out between us.
Before I lost him, forever.
Work what out?
I'll tell you when we know each other better.
Daniel took everything and he moved out.
He was angry.
That's why there are memories here of Peter, and not of your father.
I just have to press send.
Want to call the police?
We are the police.
Why did Haugen cry on your pillow?
- I won't talk about my sources.
- He contacted you between 12:00 and 16:00?
He had no coverage.
- He probably had more sophisticated equipment.
- He sat here for questioning.
- No phone.
On video.
- We think you're full of shit.
We don't believe your explanation.
That's not my problem.
- Why should we believe you?
- When we know you're full of shit?
- Who took the picture?
- Who's the woman?
- It's a source.
- It's your sister-in-law.
Haugen was a sick man, but she shouldn't suffer for that.
She doesn't deserve that.
If you drag her in just to make a fucking big show, you'll get more attention than you can dream of.
You're in Sports.
Will you give us a yellow card?
You forgot to ask the most important question:
Who took the picture?
Who said we don't know?
Someone wants to harm you.
They are the two biggest celebrity hunters in CID.
- Why this concern?
- You're bad at relationships,
- but not necessarily a criminal.
- What do you think?
- I won't tell that to reporters.
Hello.
I've been looking all night.
No photos of missing children.
I expanded the search to all Europe.
Open the emails Inger Marie got from Haugen and check the times.
And the video.
It can't be sent by him.
He was being interrogated by the police.
It can't have been sent by him.
- Why would...?
- Someone pretended to be Haugen.
Someone wanted to give us more information than Haugen intended.
- The email account was used after his death.
- By whom?
I can only see that the account was used, and when it was sent.
- Accepted, but not what.
- Can we find out?
- In a bit.
- Damn!
Your delicious brain deserves praise.
Can I tell Inger Marie?
Yes.
You should examine all the notes, documents, emails, and transcriptions.
- What are you doing?
- Explore places where you can't go.
Hello.
You couldn't have changed the jacket?
Tom Lied cooperated with Haugen.
I think they earned enormous sums during the banking crisis because they had insight into the government policy.
Lied is smart, so let me talk.
- Hello.
Yes?
- We have an appointment at 12:30.
- I figured you were too late.
- The 12:30 appointment is here.
Are you embarrassed by pretty girls, Peter?
- I didn't remember he was so handsome.
- He's the PR manager.
Former desk manager.
Hello, Peter.
Nice to meet you.
Inger Marie.
Wow!
Congratulations.
Let's set up the agenda.
You've been hanging around Paragon for several days.
An alarm goes off whenever people like you pass the pier.
Just because people don't like my boss, doesn't mean he did anything wrong.
Oh my God, how nice!
Two journalists.
- Peter.
- Tom.
- I'm with Peter Veras.
Ok?
- Of course.
Congratulations.
I just have to change first.
Would you take care of our guests?
- Would you like something to drink?
- Coffee, please.
Good.
I'll also have something to drink.
Hello.
Everything okay?
You got your coffee ...
Very nice place.
Room for another PR Manager?
It was supposed to be a portrait interview.
But now your name popped up.
It tends to do that.
How do we get a close and accurate portrait of my personality?
You've brought a sports journalist.
Or are you here to take pictures?
- You are from Fredrikstad?
- Ormen, just outside Fredrikstad.
But Vinderen girls like you can't distinguish the difference.
- Cake and all.
- Oh yes.
- You are from the outside, you said?
- Outside of Fredrikstad.
And here.
- It's my great weakness and strength.
- Strength?
Age Haugen taught me one thing:
Norway is a small country.
But he was wrong.
- Wrong?
- Don't repeat everything I say.
He thought if you just knew someone, you also knew the shortcuts.
- But you need perspective.
- How do you get that?
What is...?
- The method?
- The secret?
The talent?
You've had impressive expansions in recent years.
I have perspective and do the opposite of what most people do.
If one accepts the status quo, you only work for the interests of few.
Some say the devil's best trick was to convince everyone he doesn't exist.
- My favourite movie.
- The film wasn't true to its sources.
Baudelaire was.
But I think he was wrong too.
Do you like French poets, Vinderen-girl?
Is it possible to gain insight into who invested in "Lied Invest"?
- Is the portrait interviewed over?
- Start-up capital?
- You did have a great deal of money.
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
- I didn't think you had any.
- I didn't have a secret method.
- Ask a question he'd answer.
I'm trying to figure out what happened to Age Haugen's plans.
- You knew his brother?
- Daniel?
Veritable Truth itself?
No.
Several didn't.
- What is it with men?
- Yes, what is it with men?
I have to take this.
Sorry.
Yes, what is it?
- You asked me to call.
- Oh yes, is that so.
My brother and Age Haugen knew each other.
What did they have in common?
Money, I guess.
- There's a lot I could tell...
- Are you quite sure?
Sure?
Cardboard boxes, papers...
Can you mail it over right away?
Terrific.
Bye!
Sorry.
I just have to open an attachment I had sent over.
Yes, here it is:
Someone with a position in the government apparatus, with invaluable insight into the banking crisis, was Age Haugen's partner.
Is it also your method?
- What?
- To cooperate with people in government?
No.
I never cooperate with politicians.
They don't understand politics.
Then they hardly understand what I do.
- You know anything?
- No.
No connections?
What I do, is difficult.
If we found out otherwise, would you be surprised?
Terrified.
What were we doing there?
He revealed nothing.
I got him to feel safe.
He was lying like crazy.
Haugen, Lied and the Minister had an illicit relationship.
- Do you have any evidence?
- Soon.
I'll find documentation.
- But you haven't.
- When we find evidence...
- I have just three days.
- So you run with proof that you don't have?
I find it, and we have on tape that he's lying.
That he denies everything.
What happened to you?
If you think I'm stupid, then I'm playing stupid.
Of course.
I know where the person pretending to be Age Haugen will be tonight.
I found fragments of an email.
The sender confirmed the invitation.
Autumn festival at Treschow tonight.
The person who sent the video of the child will be at the party.
No.
It won't do.
The person that I think pressured Daniel and Haugen will be at the party.
I can't go there with you.
I'll become Daniel's widow straight away.
For Andreas's sake.
Over 100 guests were invited.
And you have only half an email message.
That's all I have.
Mind if I look in the books?
Looking at books is the finest thing you can do with your life.
- Why did Dad start in business?
- To annoy me.
He managed that.
God was the first economist.
But he was first and foremost a socialist.
- Dad?
- God.
I'm going to the library.
Want anything from there?
No.
I have enough to read.
- You don't have the full view by yourself.
- Relax.
I hope to trigger something.
- Can't Inger Marie help you?
- She can't.
But Eva's there.
- I can come and help out.
- No.
- You should look for ripples in the water.
- Yes, see everything by yourself.
- I smelt fuses before.
- Your job is not to make me sick.
- Nausea?
- Wrong word.
I have faith.
7th commandment:
Thou shalt not steal.
They are for the guests.
- You can't go up now.
- He will see me.
Hello.
You didn't answer your phone.
Budget negotiations.
Everyone wants more, but we have less than ever.
I need painter's phone number.
- The painting that your son donated?
- Celebrities of his calibre - clearly aren't in the phonebook.
Do you have it?
I have it.
Why dig into it now?
Let's call it an attempt to understand ones family.
- Hello?
- We've found what you're looking for.
- Signatures?
- Yes.
Lied and Hjorth.
- The Minister.
- Yes, I know.
You must get hold of the documents.
We need the real ones.
You'll have to borrow them.
- The dragon is here.
- Be creative.
I've never cooperated with politicians...
- He's lying in black and white.
- In mono, you mean.
Lied and the Minister?
I considered voting for the party because of him.
That was the day before the congress.
- I think I'm going to give birth!
- Don't do it here.
No, see there.
Eva!
You came.
There are worse escorts, if not in Norway.
What does Mathiesen think about you taking care of the beautiful people?
- There are worse people to hang out with.
- Stroke us with the hairs this evening.
I'll behave myself properly to set a new standard.
- I'm not opposed to small scandals.
- Talk to yo later.
- Hello, hello.
- How nice.
This will help to embarrass him.
Now it's important to keep your mouth shut.
This will be in print in two days.
But first the Minister will have to comment it.
- In the morning.
- As if that wasn't enough...
A press photo from an Italian newspaper.
About a year ago.
The Minister visiting Rome.
Outside the official program.
- It's Yvonne Haugen.
- Arm in arm with Mr. Morality.
- This shouldn't appear in print first?
- It doesn't hurt to go out with two stories.
We're not publishing that tomorrow?
I promised to keep Yvonne Haugen out of it.
The image was sent to me.
This is politics and morals.
You need to talk to the minister and get his version.
- Meanwhile...
- In the meantime?
We are not becoming a gossip-paper!
You have to see this in context.
First, focus on breaking the law.
Then follow up with morals.
If you can snag him on the first, then you can show character weakness.
Others might also have the photo?
If you let Jensen get away with this, no newspaper will show you any mercy.
There's a correct procedure, and a fucking rubbish one.
I haven't endorsed Jensen's proposal.
I wanted to hear it first.
You must discuss proposals before you decide.
I agree with you.
Print the issues as they stand, so no need to use the newspaper story to get the point across.
- Do you find anyone guilty?
- They all are.
But maybe not the ones we're looking for.
I should probably take a familiar tone.
Self-scandalizing.
Twice in the same day.
That's a lot.
- It'll be every day henceforth.
- Suddenly smitten?
Admiration from afar:
A real and raw infatuation, which I hope is reciprocated.
Then you must stop meeting others.
And you must give something.
This is for charity.
- Give as much a journalist have a heart for.
- That's not much.
- I take what I can get.
- And a little more than that too.
Hello!
Hello, Andreas?
This is a happy day for us.
I like friends.
And challenges.
One experience too little of both.
Not good for my character.
But we appreciate what's really of value: friendship.
Let me introduce my latest addition to the endangered species list
Friends of Frederick's.
Tom Lied!
He gets the bell today.
Theodor.
The new nickname that Fredrik gave me.
Theodor the teddy bear.
Raise your glasses!
Cheers for Fredrik and this evenings charity: children's village in Malawi!
For every krone you donate, I give two.
I already gave 10 million, so we will probably have to find more villages.
Cheers for Fredrik!
Cheers for this evening!
Andreas, you weren't here.
I drove out looking for you.
Call me back, please.
Yes...
I was asked to give by Tom Theodor.
Loyalty was mentioned.
Compared to you I'll come up short.
What am I willing to sacrifice for a good cause?
Loyalty isn't about doing good.
You show loyalty when you do something for someone you wouldn't normally do.
That is to sacrifice something of yours or someone else's.
True loyalty is to go beyond your limits, from light to dark.
And speaking of God's many gifts.
Abraham... one of God's favourites, was asked to sacrifice his son out of loyalty to God.
And that's a lot, teddy bear.
But was there no reciprocal service?
Did Abraham get kickbacks, as you say?
He made his covenant with God.
He should worship just one God and his family would prevail in a country overflowing with milk and honey.
He would get money for sacrificing his son's life.
Money for a child.
My question to you isn't what you want to sacrifice.
That's an individual choice.
But for whom?
Peter?
As my mother always said to me:
I think it was a nice speach.
Have one more drink, otherwise it's too boring here.
Cheers!
I know who you are.
Your brother was a thief.
A silly, simple thief who killed himself because he was a coward.
Is that what you want to tell me?
It seems someone has to tell you, you're not wanted.
You are pathetic.
It's what you are.
Obviously, not only just that, because you appear provoked.
It's dangerous to pretend you know something you don't.
- People can die from that.
- Who is this?
I warn you against going out in public, like you just did.
From a land-line.
He's here.
There are so many weird people here.
You must have had a meaning.
- You're way out there.
- Is there a land-line here?
- Top floor, in the cafeteria.
What was the relationship between Haugen and Daniel five years ago?
The video you sent me?
Who was the child?
Why did you send me the video?
You need to look further back.
25 years to understand the mess.
- And what was that?
- I know nothing about this.
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I got him.
The car, at least.
I took photos of the car.
It is leased.
Probably by a company.
But I need go home to find out.
Peter!
- Hello!
- She's with us.
- Us?
- Yeah, you.
Us.
We.
- Peter, help her.
- We've been together for three years.
She investigated your husband.
Wait here, I'll see if anybody knows who owns the car.
- Hello.
- I have someone who wants to talk to you.
One of the most important things you can buy for the money is violence.
Why doesn't he do his work?
I expected someone to contact me.
You should only call in an emergency, and this isn't an emergency.
I don't know if you realize how serious this is, what we started.
- I called just now...
- Yes.
And told me to do my job.
My job.
Do you know what it is?
My job isn't to do what you won't do - but what you can't imagine.
Horrible and gruesome things.
Don't worry about my job.
You don't have the stomach for it.
Don't you have children to take care of?
NARRATOR:
Old Geelong Jail, a prison so bleak and hostile that to escape its clutches inmates would resort to any desperate measure.
[screaming]
[prison door slamming] [gasping]
NARRATOR:
And within its grim walls, many fearsome felons have been sentenced to life after death.
Tonight on Haunting:
Australia, the abandoned old Geelong Jail, since convict days a place of brutality and misery.
-See that?
NARRATOR:
A sight said to be swarming with paranormal activity as the alleged ghosts of inmates past stalk its cells and corridors.
-What's that?
-I've investigated haunted prisons the world over.
Geelong's the top five.
What was that?
Oh, they're coming.
NARRATOR:
Another chilling challenge for the Haunting:
Australia team.
From the UK, psychic bad boy Ian Lawman, medium and ordained exorcist.
An old school supernatural sleuth, Ray Jorden.
From India, ghost hunter and metaphysicist Gaurav Tiwari.
From Australia, accomplished paranormal researcher Allen
Tiller, and medium clairvoyant Rayleen Kable.
From the US, internationally renowned lead investigator Robb
Demarest.
-I've been investigating the paranormal for over 20 years.
You name it, I've hunted it.
And I believe this team has what it takes to find out what's haunting down under.
[music playing]
NARRATOR:
Located on the southern shores of Victoria,
Geelong boasts more heritage buildings per capita than anywhere else in Australia.
And where there is history, there are ghosts.
The city's spooky sights include the abandoned Geelong Boys
Grammar School.
Once a seat of learning for the elite, its alumni includes His Royal Highness Prince Charles.
But perched only blocks away, this forbidding three-story bluestone lays claim as most haunted-- the Old Geelong Jail.
-It's a very cold place.
It has a very bloody history.
-Pretty much every in of the floor here has had human blood it.
-This was a prison of misery, mayhem, and murder.
NARRATOR:
Geelong Jail opened its fearsome doors in 1853, an impenetrable fortress to house the worse of the worst.
It operated for almost a century and a half.
Until closing its doors in the 1990s, modern era prisoners were locked in the same stone cells that contained convicts in colonial times.
Geelong Jail was three levels of pain, despair, and death.
-Four executions but over 500 confirmed deaths.
NARRATOR:
A common way for feuding felons to dispatch each other was shanking by shiv or homemade knife.
How will the team from Haunting:
Australia handle this fearsome place?
-The place is imposing.
It's menacing, it's scary, it's huge.
-I think there's going to be a lot of hard core men inside here, spirit wise.
I think they're going to hate us being in here.
I think they're going to push us out and they're going to cause a lot of problems for the investigators.
NARRATOR:
As the ghost hunters enter the cell block they already face a setback.
-Hey, look at this guy.
-Hey.
NARRATOR:
On their last investigation, segueing on a bush track near haunted Woodford Academy,
Gaurav took a bad spill.
GAURAV TIWARI:
Shit.
NARRATOR:
His teammates are about to learn the full extent of his injuries.
-I went to the hospital.
I thought it was a sprain, but doctors diagnosed that I fractured my tibia.
-Oh.
-What's the-- what's the prognosis?
-Well, I am to be on crunches and braces for six weeks.
-I just have a question-- in Australia does crunches mean something different?
[laughter]
NARRATOR:
All jokes aside, will Gaurav cope with the rigors of investigation?
-Well, I'm here to find some spirits, whatever it takes and wherever it takes me.
So I'm committed to find some ghosts here.
ROBB DEMAREST:
Well, it's good to have you back.
NARRATOR:
Every light inside the stark interior is switched off, plunging the environment into murky darkness.
CCTV cameras have been rigged to keep watch on cells and gantries.
At surveillance central, they'll be monitored constantly.
Our paranormal investigators are ready for action.
Let the ghostly games begin.
First to set off into the gloomy confines of the deserted jail are mediums Ian Lawman and Rayleen Kable.
-Good luck.
-Have a good one.
NARRATOR:
Both are strapped into high definition microcamera rigs recording at all times to capture any paranormal evidence.
At surveillance central, Gaurav and Ray keep a watchful eye.
-I feel really, really sick as I'm walking down here.
I'm absolutely pooping myself.
A psychic is somebody who can pick up on here and now.
It's kind of an energy type thing that we grab hold of.
Someone's following me.
OK, I'm going to go up the stairway.
NARRATOR:
Ian enters the cell that over 100 years ago housed one of Geelongs most infamous inmates-- suicidally violent giant of a man, Percy Ramage.
-So if somebody's been murdered or some trauma's taken place, they're the ones wanting to talk to us and explain what happened.
I don't know what room it is, but I'm drawn to this room here.
I'm aware of a big man as I see him.
He's, um, he appears a lot bigger than me-- um, well over six foot.
And I feel like somebody's walking in my cell and pulled my head back and just cut my throat.
[scream]
-And one night he tried to take his own life by cutting his neck open.
He screams.
Two wardens open up his cell and very quickly they shackled him.
NARRATOR:
On a gangway directly beneath the cell,
Ian again believes he's picking up on Ramage's rampage.
-I'm just aware of, um, somebody being thrown right over the top.
-Now, he was so big that he managed to push his way past the two jail wardens on the first floor and on the third level, he jumped for his life.
[screaming]
NARRATOR:
But Ramage got tangled on a crossbar.
-His shackles got wrapped around it and his arms were almost ripped from his body.
NARRATOR:
A stark reminder of this epic suicide attempt, the bend in the bar is still there today.
ADAM WAYNE JENKINS:
He wanted out of here.
NARRATOR:
With such supposedly hostile energies trapped in its walls, the investigation of Geelong Jail will test Rayleen's nerves.
RAYLEEN KABLE (VOICEOVER):
It will be spiritually challenging for me because I'm a female coming into a male environment.
I expect the unexpected.
-Even though she's a very strong medium, we-- we just don't know what's going to happen.
Uh, there have been reports that females who are in the area, um, in certain areas, have been affected by-- by alleged spirits.
So it's going to be interesting to see what-- what happens.
-When I'm investigating, my process is-- is quite simple.
I'm very open from the moment I walk into investigation area.
So I do try to set some form of boundary where yes, I'm an-- I'm an open channel, but there's certain things that I will and won't put up with from a spirit.
NARRATOR:
The spirits of Geelong are allegedly very aggressive, especially with females.
-I was in a cell, number 75 with, um, with a group, and I got scratched on the neck.
-We walked into one cell and, um, and next think you know,
I'd been scratched.
One of the other girls had felt shoved against the wall.
NARRATOR:
But the most vicious attack reported is from tour guide Jodie Hemer.
She claimed it occurred in the prison kitchen.
-I was standing, um, at the end of the table there on night and I heard a noise to the right of me.
I felt groping up my legs all the way.
It was very invasive and scary.
I actually ran out of the room screaming.
-I feel like I've got eyes wat-- watching me from everywhere.
I'm, uh, in cell 86.
Um, I'm going to close the door behind me.
I don't know if I really want to do that, but I will.
Is there anyone-- is there any spirits living in this confines of the cell?
Oh, I just-
- I heard a male's voice then.
It just asked me what I'm doing here.
I feel like, um, the soul that was in this cell at some point-- oh, I just felt someone touched my hair.
Oh.
Mm.
Don't do that.
I'm not giving you permission to touch my hair.
This cell is so cold, but yet my head is so hot.
My-
- I'm going out of the room now.
My guide's telling me to get out of here.
So I think that's a strong cue.
I just heard him say bye-bye.
Oh, I just felt him grab my hand.
Oh.
NARRATOR:
The potential menace of this site is also becoming apparent to Ian.
-I feel really scared as I'm walking down this staircase.
I've got lots of kind of-- what's that?
Hello?
I can hear full conversations.
[bang]
-What the [bleep] was that?
It's almost as if I'm being followed.
It's just this really weird shit going on in here.
When I was walking around the corridors
I just felt like I was, um, being followed, and it's almost like I was waiting to get picked out.
NARRATOR:
In this shower block, where prisoners were at their most vulnerable, many lives were lost to unforeseen attacks.
-Let's just see what's going on in here.
There's this [inaudible] of Jimmy who, um, is in here.
I'm kind of drawn to this third area here and I'm kind of leaning here just kind of washing my head like that and I'm just aware of this Jimmy character coming around kind of this corner from this area here and shanking me
right in the, um, kidney.
And he snapped the blade off and I'm to the floor.
As a psychic, this is quite intense because there's a lot of energies going on in here and I feel that I am actually getting ganged up on.
I need to withdraw from here.
NARRATOR:
As Ian high tails it out of the shower block, Rayleen warily enters the kitchen.
This is where the tour guide says she was subjected to ghostly groping.
-Just listen.
I can hear something then.
I know there's a spirit in here, I just need you to make yourself be known.
Oh.
Oh.
Ooh, shit.
This energy-- get off me.
This is all about touching in here.
Who are you?
And why did you just touch me?
Everyone wants to touch me in this place.
I'm over it.
He tells me his name's-- name is James.
Is that correct?
Yes.
-Rayleen's picked up on James, Ian's picked up on Jimmy.
A lot of people that I know called James they're called Jimmy or Jim.
NARRATOR:
Could the murderous Jimmy encountered in the shower by Ian be the same spirit Rayleen believes to be harassing her?
-I am watching my back.
He's telling me to watch my back.
NARRATOR:
As Rayleen heads back to the safety of surveillance central she's convinced she's picked up a nasty spirit.
-The worst that I feel can happen is you can have an attachment.
That would be my biggest fear is that it wants to be with me and not leave me.
NARRATOR:
To remove it she must first remove itself from its lair.
With spirited fingers, she sheds herself up psychic stress.
-Even to this side as I'm speaking
I've just got so much energy.
I need to clear that energy before I go into further investigation.
Otherwise, I-
- I just won't be able to do it.
NARRATOR:
Ian is now all alone in the cell block-- or is he?
-I don't know what room it is, but I'm drawn to this room here.
I'm just going to spin around here.
[bang] [bleep]
GAURAV TIWARI:
We have lost Ian on audio.
NARRATOR:
The loud bang, which occurred after Ian shut the cell door has our psychic on edge.
-Nothing there that could have made that noise.
I don't know what it was.
I shut the door once again and it didn't make the same noise.
What the [bleep] was that?
NARRATOR:
With an urge for human, rather than ghostly company, Ian returns to surveillance central.
IAN LAWMAN:
Hey, guys.
-Hey, Daddy.
-Wow.
That-- that was quite an experience.
It was, um, really, really weird.
Now, as I shut the door there was an almighty bang.
[bang] [bleep]
IAN LAWMAN:
Almost like lock down.
-Yeah, we noticed.
IAN LAWMAN:
Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, I think it's at that point we actually lost audio for a while.
IAN LAWMAN:
OK, well, that's really, really funny then, because I went really lightheaded and my ears buzzed and I couldn't hear for a split second.
So you lost audio, I couldn't hear.
NARRATOR:
Our paranormal investigators weren't the only ones who lost sound.
For the first time in his 20-year career, all channels went down on our sound recorder's gear.
-When that noise happened, that really big bang, we lost audio on both yourself and Rayleen-- two together.
Not only that, but this thing froze.
-Is it normal for your-- for your--
-No.
Never.
Never, never ever happened before.
-In my opinion so far, this is haunted to hell.
NARRATOR:
Despite his incapacitating leg injury, gutsy Gaurav is bent on proving his worth to the team.
On crutches, he hobbles to the far end of the eastern wing.
The ground floor is where many apparitions are reported.
This intrepid investigator is bent on catching one on camera.
-Is there anyone with me who would like to show himself?
I would like you to come forward and show yourself to me.
I was a person who never believed in ghosts and spirits or any existence of paranormal
I was training to become a commercial pilot in 2006 and I was given an apartment by my flight school.
But something happened to me.
These started with this things like poltergeist activity.
We started hearing whispers and we could not find anyone there who was doing that.
It really challenged my belief system.
I started looking into paranormal research and slowly, gradually, I came across so many things in life that would really make me understand about nature of spirits.
When I went back to India in 2009
I established India's first paranormal organization called
Indian Paranormal Society.
NARRATOR:
Allen is equally eager to ensnare a spirit.
ALLEN TILLER:
All right.
Rayleen, earlier on tonight we had our meeting downstairs and, um, I saw something move on the landing up here.
NARRATOR:
With Rayleen, he heads to a room adjacent to where his sighting occurred.
ALLEN TILLER:
I live in the town of Kapunda in South Australia.
I was a forklift driver in the wineries.
I run a lot of, uh, social media pages to do with hauntings in Australia.
I write various blogs about different hauntings.
We also run SA Paranormal, which is predominantly an investigation team that covers ghosts, UFOs, cryptids, and other paranormal things.
I first came across the paranormal reading one of my grandfather's books, which was about the Bermuda
Triangle and I would think I would have been about seven years old.
It wasn't until I moved to Queensland and I came across a ghost tour up there and I walked around on the ghost tour knowing a little bit of the history myself and, uh, the tour operator actually
got it incredibly wrong so I started researching it myself and that led into becoming an investigator.
You can try to connect with whoever's here and see what you come up with.
-You've been seen earlier tonight.
I've got a voice recorder there, we've got cameras going.
and what we want you to do is let us know who you are.
Actually, I'm feeling quite tall.
I'm feeling very tall.
I'm not tall, the spirit behind me.
-I'm just filming you now with a full spectrum video camera.
I'm just going to sweep around the room, see if we get anything.
-There in the corners.
In the corners.
Yeah.
Quickly.
There's a lot of energy on top of my head at the moment and to my right.
Right here to here.
ALLEN TILLER:
Mm-hm.
-I'm just getting the sense they don't like it.
Oh, it just touched my head then.
It just touched the top of my head.
ALLEN TILLER:
Lift Rayleen's hair up.
-Come on, do it.
I can feel you're going to do it.
You're just there.
ALLEN TILLER:
This wasn't always just a jail.
There was actually a girls reformatory here, as well.
NARRATOR:
Incredibly, in the 1860s and 1870s a wing of the jail was utilized as an industrial school for orphaned girls, meaning innocent young females were clustered under the same roof as hardened prisoners.
One of the most reported apparitions today is a young girl in period garb.
-The young 12-year-old girl, she just sits about halfway up the stairs.
She looks sad.
She's got a ragged canvas dress and matted long hair.
-So I'm wondering if the little girl could come forward for me, please, and touch Rayleen or talk to Rayleen.
Rayleen's a mother.
She someone's mum.
If you're missing your mum, and you'd like a bit of motherly love, maybe you could come forward and give Rayleen a big hug.
I'm sure she won't mind.
-Touch my hands.
I need you to tap me twice-- nice and strong, like patty cake, patty cake.
I'm feeling like I can actually I feel my hand going down.
But I felt one tap but I need you to do two taps, sweetie.
NARRATOR:
Alan and Rayleen head downstairs to investigate the prison kitchen, where a tour guide suffered a terrifying ordeal.
En route, Allen suggests a quick detour.
-Ooh.
[laughing]
-Oh, shit.
Did you know it was there?
-Yep.
-Ah.
NARRATOR:
Scary mannequins are the bane of ghost hunters everywhere.
Good humored prank notwithstanding,
Allen now realizes something serious may be happening inside the jail.
-All right, Rayleen.
We're hearing noises at the other end, as well, so I'm going to head right down the other end of the jail.
If you want to stay down here.
Is that cool?
All right.
I'm on my way.
Someone was making some noise down here before and I'm down here by myself.
Want to make those noises again?
So we're on the third level, Rayleen and I.
It sounds like doors rattling.
[thudding sounds]
-That sounds like footsteps right now.
[thudding sounds]
-There's no up there.
We're much alone in here and there's definitely noises up there.
I think we need to get Ian back out here.
Something's happening over there.
NARRATOR:
To provide more ghost hunting grunt,
Ray also heads out to the cell block.
He joins Ian near the gallows.
-Hello?
Ian.
I thought I saw someone walk past down here.
Can you come forward and talk to us?
Make a noise?
-Is anyone here with us?
Tap three times.
[tapping sounds]
-Where's that coming from?
One, two, three.
It's coming from over there.
I can hear whispering everywhere.
I can't pinpoint where it is.
It was really, really noisy.
There was a lot of noises, a lot of bangs.
I could hear whistling, I could hear whispering.
NARRATOR:
The alleged ghosts of Old Geelong Jail appear to be staging a paranormal prison riot--
-I heard like a moan.
NARRATOR: --with unexplained sounds emanating from all corners of the cell block.
-Where's that coming from?
NARRATOR:
Ian and Ray are determined to chase them down.
-Come on there.
Go, go, go.
This way.
NARRATOR:
But their investigatory efforts are hampered by the jail's compartmentalized wings, designed to contain violent outbreaks.
It's as though the cunning criminal spirits are toying with them--
-OK, who's here?
-What's that?
[strange noise]
-What the [bleep] was that?
Go, go, go.
It's at the other side now.
IAN LAWMAN:
I'm going.
NARRATOR: --sending them on a wild goose chase from one end to another.
IAN LAWMAN:
All hell broke loose.
There were certain noises coming from the left, the right, the center.
It was just phenomenal.
-I wonder if this is where they used to hang people here.
NARRATOR:
Determined to get to the source of the chaos,
Ian returns with Robb to cell 45--
-What good is it?
-Let's just see what it is.
-Oh, we can do something.
NARRATOR: --where earlier he encountered the spirit of former inmate, the suicidal Percy Ramage.
[screams]
NARRATOR:
The psychic and the investigator plan to play paranormal good cop bad cop with the cell's inmate.
-Ian, here's what I'm thinking we should do, all right?
-Mm-hm.
-You see if you can bring him here.
-Uh-huh.
-I'll see if I can record.
NARRATOR:
Ian issues the challenge.
-Can you come into this cell and man up?
Anybody else out there who wants to walk in this cell?
I was aware of things, Robb was kind of aware of something going on.
And I thought for a great experiment it would be amazing if I stand outside, gear the spirits up, and see if they can take on this big guy.
If you can hear my voice, there's Robb in there.
Let's man up.
Go take Robb.
Go.
We need you to walk in that cell right now.
Go on.
-We've got increasing an shadow of darkness in the corner right now.
-OK.
NARRATOR:
Is the purported spirit of Percy Ramage marking its territory?
-I see this dark mass raise up in the corner until it's about six, seven feet.
I mean this thing's towering over me.
Let's switch.
IAN LAWMAN:
Yeah.
OK, big guy, it's just you and I. Robb's outside, I'm inside.
Let's do it.
Then we swapped over roles and I got the same thing, a really vast, high shadow-- what was easily seven feet, really menacing character.
There's some other shit going on down here.
[screaming]
NARRATOR:
Sensing he may have caught something during his spirit photography session,
Gaurav reviews the results at surveillance central.
GAURAV TIWARI:
I took this-- these pictures on the ground floor.
-OK.
-You know what I was doing?
I was trying to challenge spirits to show themselves.
Let's see if it captured something.
-What's that?
GAURAV TIWARI:
Looks like a humanoid shape.
Wow.
Is there someone standing here?
NARRATOR:
Zooming in they discover someone or something is definitely lurking in the darkness.
-And I see a full body apparition or a human being standing there, but there was no human being as such.
-Yeah, I can definitely make out the shape.
It does look like it's someone standing, you know, looking straight ahead.
So what we need to do, then, is take this to analysis--
-Exactly.
- --and-- and-- and inspect it more.
-Exactly.
NARRATOR:
In the shots taken before and after, no figure is apparent, but in this shot it can clearly be seen.
-We have holy grail or a full body apparition.
NARRATOR:
An alleged Geelong ghost is that of a former prison guard.
Rather than resting in peace, he patrols the prison in death.
If he does roam within these walls, could this be the spirit that terrified a local tour guide one night?
-And just as I'm about to leave, I looked up to the third level of the jail and I could see the perfect silhouette of a man looking down at me.
That was enough for me to actually feel so uncomfortable that I had to leave the building and leave the building quick.
NARRATOR:
Although further examination is required,
Gaurav may have caught the spirit of the prison guard on his ghostly night rounds.
Ian is still alone in cell 45 with a seven foot tall shadow.
IAN LAWMAN:
Hey, dude, I don't like it in here.
-Any spirits that may be present in this jail tonight-- [bang]
IAN LAWMAN:
What was that?
-I don't have the foggiest clue.
It sounded like a door slamming.
-That's what I've been getting all night.
ROBB DEMAREST:
I can't see anyone.
-I can hear footsteps.
ROBB DEMAREST:
That's in there with you.
IAN LAWMAN:
Cheers.
[clang]
IAN LAWMAN:
What was that?
-Oh, they're coming.
Let's watch someone.
Hang tight, Ian.
NARRATOR:
On the Geelong Jail gallows, cutouts of human silhouettes recreate an execution.
Robb observed a dark shadow move between the hangman and the condemned.
-I saw someone walk across in front of me.
But they-- they stopped behind a, like a cardboard cutout.
So I'm waiting, I'm waiting.
I call out to them, nothing.
I jam down there, there's no one there.
There's literally no one there.
Did you see that?
Did you see someone just sneak past here and hide behind here?
IAN LAWMAN:
Robb?
Robb?
Oh!
ROBB DEMAREST:
You all right?
IAN LAWMAN:
Yeah, yeah.
ROBB DEMAREST:
What happened?
-I don't know.
It was almost like-- you know when someone catches your feet from behind you like that?
-You all right?
-Yeah.
-All right.
I just saw-- you see the-- the little cutouts for the demonstration?
-Uh-huh.
-I saw someone go walk from behind number one to behind number two.
-OK.
-Then they stopped, and then they were gone.
-This is creepy, Robb.
-Big time.
I aimed the camera at it.
I mean I think I should have it.
-So let's get this right.
So you-- you visualized somebody walking on this passage.
-I'm not-
- I'm not you.
I didn't visualize it, I saw a dude walk from there--
-So you saw the dude walk-- walk?
-Yeah.
My camera was aimed straight ahead, right at that area.
I've got it.
We caught it.
NARRATOR:
But the footage is dark and grainy, leaving Robb unable to make the call that he caught a ghost on camera.
Nevertheless, confident they've locked down some extraordinary evidence, the team calls it a night, leaving the otherworldly occupants of the jail to their eternal incarceration.
Before focusing on evidence analysis, and with adrenaline still pumping from their investigation, the team need some high octane release.
Ian fancies himself a regular [inaudible].
-So what's the fastest lap time out there?
-Uh, the fastest lap times is a 26.1 second lap.
-And who owns that?
-That was me.
-Till today.
NARRATOR:
The gauntlet has been thrown.
The ghost hunters helmet up.
-Defeat is not an option.
-Speed is my other name.
-They're going to suck my fumes.
-Oh, I don't even know why I'm doing this.
I can't even drive.
NARRATOR:
The race commences.
Shortest average time over six laps is winner.
True to his bragging, Ian is off to a flying start.
-Aargh.
[inaudible]
NARRATOR:
But Allen is in the way.
-Come on, move.
NARRATOR:
For an armchair enthusiast,
Ray is having a blast.
But there's little chance of him joining the two minute club.
-For a non driver, I'm doing all right.
NARRATOR:
Rayleen maintains her position at the back of the pack and proves no obstacles for Ian.
-Ian, I'm going to kill you later.
NARRATOR:
The checkered flag goes up.
Lap times tabulated, and psychic speed demon Ian Lawman emerges victorious--
-Yo!
Who's your daddy?
NARRATOR: --ahead of Allen and Gaurav, but considerably over the lap record.
The failure's not an option Demarest is conspicuously missing from the winner's podium.
-Never before have I seen such injustice.
I guarantee you I had a faster lap than any of you.
Watch the tape back.
You're going to see I whooped on all of you.
-Jealous loser.
Jealous loser.
NARRATOR:
Having peddled some serious metal, the team is now in study mode.
They're ready to review evidence.
And what seat of higher learning could be a more apt setting than Prince Charles's old stomping ground, the Geelong Grammar School?
They convene in its former assembly hall.
First, they learn Allen's amusing prank on Rayleen may have paid dividends.
-OK, team, just have a bit of a watch of this.
RAYLEEN KABLE (ON TV):
After me?
ALLEN TILLER (ON TV):
After you.
Ladies first.
RAYLEEN KABLE (ON TV):
Ooh.
-Whoa, spooky.
NARRATOR:
Prior to her scare, Rayleen believes she made contact with the reformatory girl ghost.
Moments after her scare, Allen recorded an EVP, or electronic voice phenomenon.
-Now, as Rayleen and I walk out from this area, you're going to hear something.
RAYLEEN KABLE (ON TV):
Let's go and do some exploring in the areas I have found to be--
GAURAV TIWARI:
It definitely sounds like a female voice.
NARRATOR:
Was the little girl commenting from beyond the grave on Rayleen's fright?
-My reaction hearing it, um, because it's in the same kind of scene as Rayleen's getting scared, sounds like spooky.
And that's a really weird echo effect of ooky, ooky, ooky afterwards.
IAN LAWMAN:
I-
- I agree with that, That I could get, yeah.
Rayleen, do you think it was actually a spirit of a-- a female or a child taking the Mickey out of you because of your just-- the experience you've just had?
-Highly likely, Ian, because it doesn't sound like an older person.
It would be a younger spirit.
IAN LAWMAN:
Yeah.
-So yeah, quite possibly.
NARRATOR:
The girl does seem benign enough, but an EVP catch from Rayleen sounds disturbingly malignant.
Guys, the next bit of evidence I really want you to listen to.
Uh, it's-- it is really, really scary.
[grunt]
-Wow.
[grunt]
-Guttural growl.
-And just to clarify, we can hear
Allen in the background right before the growl comes, right?
-Yeah.
-OK.
I mean I drew back.
That's spooky.
That's scary.
-I'm still a little bit shaken by it, to be honest.
[grunt]
-What we have here is the triple connection.
IAN LAWMAN:
Yeah.
-We have the technical side-- we recorded this voice-- we have the provocation technique, and we have the response that you're getting.
So the entire team, everything we did came together to create this.
And this is pretty-- pretty intense.
IAN LAWMAN:
Good stuff.
-Yeah, very intense.
IAN LAWMAN:
Good stuff.
-It's not-- a jail's not a nice place to be in, but some jails can be more brutal than others.
[grunt]
NARRATOR:
Could the spirit of violent prisoner Percy Ramage have been lurking near Rayleen during her investigation?
[groaning] [grunt]
NARRATOR:
Gaurav has examined his extraordinary photographic evidence closely.
-I took thousands of pictures here.
The whole corridor was empty.
There was no one.
But in this picture can you notice something?
-Yeah.
There's-- it looks like a guy standing right there.
-Right.
What I did, I analyzed this picture decreasing the gamma level and increasing the exposure.
It definitely looks like a person standing there and not a shadow.
NARRATOR:
His spirit snap clearly shows a shadowy male figure standing opposite the prison guards box on ground level.
GAURAV TIWARI:
I think I've captured a full body apparition.
ALLEN TILLER:
It's very clear and defined, though, isn't it?
-Yeah.
IAN LAWMAN:
And there's absolutely no one in the area at all?
-No one at all.
ROBB DEMAREST:
It-- to me it looks like a guard on duty, standing there at his post.
IAN LAWMAN:
Yeah.
NARRATOR:
Has he snared a shot of one of the jail's most celebrated spirits, the prison guard ghost?
-Gaurav, it's an incredible picture.
I've seen some photos which have part apparition, but this full body-- I'm totally blown away.
-I've done hundreds of investigations in over 40 countries around the world, and this photograph is right up there at the top of the best evidence
I've ever seen.
That-- that's a fantastic catch.
NARRATOR:
Old Geelong Jail may never give up its dark secrets, but the Haunting:
Australia team believes the evidence they collected is more than sufficient to pass sentence-- highly haunted.
-Is Geelong Jail haunted?
Yeah, absolutely.
I mean this place had some of the most intense experiences and evidence that I've seen in years.
-Geelong Jail didn't prove to be disappointing at all.
It was an exciting place to be, to investigate.
We had some phenomenal results come out.
-We got so much evidence that, you know, stuff that covered every kind of section of evidence you could even want like shadow men photos, videos, audio.
-Geelong Jail is up in the top five now of, uh, paranormal investigations that I've ever done worldwide.
-This is it-- this had everything you could want.

Previously on "Beware the Batman"...
Humphrey Dumpler worked for the mob.
Genius account, went crazy after it got blown up. {*}
He escaped protective custody was never heard from him again... until now.
Batman, where are we?
Last thing I remember we were checking out a lead on a weapons' stash.
- Next thing, I wake up here.
- Ambush.
Poison darts.
Demfil chloride if I'm not mistaken. {*} Hits quick, leave just as fast.
So how do we get out of here?
Cage with fancy furniture is still a cage.
Katana wait!
- A trap!
- Good call.
No, simple deduction.
No trap on my door was meant to put us at ease.
Lower our guard.
Whoever put us here knew I would see through that.
Our captors studied our tactics.
- Short corridor here.
- Then that's our route.
Commissioner Gordon.
Mayor Grange.
- Tobias Whale!
- Wake up, loser.
Batman!
Where...
I was in my office.
Opened a window...
I was walking to my car in the City Hall parking lot.
I was visiting friends.
Celebrating being out on bail.
Where are we now?
Why Mayor Grange!
You're on square one of my latest little game.
- Humpty Dumpty.
- Dumpler!
This is Commissioner Gordon at the Gotham PD.
- Release us now or...
- But you just got here!
Don't you even wanna see what's for dinner?
Go ahead.
Don't wanna to get cold.
That's right.
The first course of this mystery is murder!
Someone in this room was responsible for any missed person's life.
But who?
Answer that and I let all the innocent parties go free.
Let's get started.
Each of you has been given one helper card.
An eclipse?
Yours is blank, Batman.
Because you shouldn't need any help!
Each card is an answer to a clue.
Match the right card to the clue and you can move on.
The first clue is right before you.
And to make things interesting there will be little obstacles along the way.
What you mean by "obstacles," baby?
Better hurry!
That's it you made it in. {*}
It'll take all five of you to solve this mystery.
And if Mayor Grange dies before you do, it's game over!
For all of you!
- Batman, we could use a little help.
- I am helping.
I'm working the puzzle.
- So the knife is the murder weapon.
- To easy.
The dummie's fingers and lips were blue, suggesting suffocation.
But the stab wound is bright red.
His blood was properly oxygenated.
- The scuff marks on the knees.
- The body was moved.
Hey!
Finish your game "I spy" get over here and help me.
The Mayor doesn't have much time.
The mannequin only appear stabbed, but he was poisoned with carbon monoxide somewhere else, that would explain the oxygenated blood.
Then brought here.
A crime that began as one thing then became another.
Only one card given to us matches that theory, Katana.
The butterfly.
Begins its life is a caterpillar before becoming something... different.
You cracked the case, Batman!
Well done.
I hope everyone likes boardgames!
Stand on a lit tile and everything is humpty toy. {*}
But if your tile goes dark and you're still on it, you're out of the game... permanently!
Tiles will light at random.
And you can only stand on one, for so long before it goes dark again.
So keep moving!
If you don't solve the mystery of what happen in this room and lay down the right card, too many tiles will fall away and together you're all hit rock bottom!
Whale, turn over that picture frame.
I'll lead the mysteries solving to you, geniuses.
It's all right.
I've got this.
It's a picture of a woman and a girl.
Maybe the woman's daughter?
This room could belong to the dead body that we've found in the dining room.
That could be his wife and child in the picture.
Seems likely.
The wires belongings left out like this.
You said the body was moved.
Maybe he was killed in here.
Possibly.
Or maybe obducted from this room, made to disappear from his family.
Gordon, your card.
Something that disappears like a rabbit dropped in a magician's hat.
Well played players!
Whale!
Batman.
Batman!
Can you make it over here?
- Don't you think we're trying?
- The beds are no, but...
Are you all right?
Yeah, but there aren't a lot of floor tiles left.
It might take us some time to make our way to you.
We need to find a way out of here.
Running isn't the answer.
Dumpty wants that exuse to kill us.
Are you willing to risk everyone's life on that?
Let's run down what we know.
Humpty-Dumpty says someone in our group had something to do with what happened to the man on the dinner table.
Whale is the only criminal in our group.
He's got to be guilty of the murder.
If it is murder, the first clue:
Someone or something that is not what it at first appears to be.
The second clue:
Making someone or something disappear.
This mystery might not be about a murder at all.
But some other action.
And that means the guilty party could still be any one of us.
Including you and me.
Us?
We didn't commit any crimes.
Batman, are you listening to me?
You don't look good, Marion.
Don't baby me, Jim!
I just need some water.
I see if I can find some.
Stay with me, and when we get our share, I can get us both out of here.
In exchange for a pardon?
If you're feeling grateful baby, I wouldn't say "no."
This room ...
it feels familiar.
Does anyone recognize the song?
I do.
It's an old sailor's song.
Peered down at the Gotham docks all the time. {*}
It's called "Deadman's moon".
Creepy tune.
I think you need to see this.
"Bats of the Western hemisphere." "Be your guide to the study of bats."
"The migration pattern in meeting habitats of the common bat."
Every book in here is about bats.
I knew it!
I knew it was something that stone freak did.
Yo popo, arrest him!
Mystery solved!
You shouldn't be accusing anyone, Whale!
You're the one met, knew the song and the record player, remember?
Stop yelling!
Don't you see this is what Humpty Dumpty wants?
For us to turn on each other.
I'm not gonna die in here because of all of you!
Braille.
You stay together here play this psycho's game.
We all know he'll never let us win.
I'll find a way out.
Good luck, chunk!
{*}
Why are you all just standing there doing nothing?
We can't just let him run off, or we all dead!
Marion,wait!
We need to stay together!
We have to go after them.
- Wrong move.
- Are you kidding?
Who knows what could happen to them without us.
Humpty Dumpty is a master game player.
He knew this would happen now, which means our team breaking apart is part of his game.
If we go after Whale and Mayor Grange, and don't solve his puzzle, we lose and Dumpty wins.
Meaning, we die.
What if you're wrong?
A sea shanty about the moon, {*} books on bats written for the blind, hiding deadly weapons.
Rather then staying, one of our team ran, and then another followed.
Both only concerned their own lives.
How do you get the eclipse out of all that?
In an eclipse you turn away because if you look into an eclipse you could go blind.
You turn a blind eye.
Just like Whale and Mayor Grange did to the safety of the group when they ran.
Excellent Batman!
You better find your friends though.
You still need everyone to make it out of here!
Hang on a second.
Guess, I like the shooting gallery.
Next time think the problem all the way through before you decide on a course of action.
And don't question me again!
You fool!
You gonna get us all killed!
Lady, you've got no authority over me in here.
All of you, stay back!
Let me go!
Let me go!
What is this?
!
Pictures of ships.
Another naval reference like the song in the Victrola. {*}
Burned cash.
A payoff gone wrong.
Whale, enough!
This is what Dumpty wants.
This is how he wins the game.
I don't care about no game, Bat!
Nowhere to look without seeing yourself.
Can't hide in here.
Have you solved the mystery, Batman?
Do you know who the bad person is?
- Yes, I know.
- Good!
Who's that?
I know this guy.
He is an arm's smuggler I put away in Black Gate.
- Ernie....
- Croskey!
Ernie Croskey.
Captain at the Flying Fox, based in Gotham harbor.
The Flying Fox?
I believe each of us has a connection to that ship and this man.
A crime that began is one thing but became another.
Ernie Croskey's ship was smuggling weapons into Gotham.
- Weapons purchased from....
- Illegal assassins.
I was the middleman, undercover for the CIA.
We wanted to track the weapons, see if they let us to any of the lead cells.
We never met Croskey though.
I just loaded the ship.
Croskey didn't even know the weapons were on board.
- Did he, Whale?
- Man that wasn't my shipment
- did it right under Croskey's nose.
- Too bad it never got to you.
- You were burnt on that deal.
- By me.
Thanks to a tip from Batman.
Since Whale never took possession of the weapons, I couldn't hold him.
But I could arrest the guy he think.
The second clue:
Something made to disappear.
In this case an innocent man taken from his family, Ernie Croskey.
Who I prosecuted and sent to jail.
The third clue:
Turning a blind eye.
In one way or another we're all responsible.
The villian we've been looking for ... is us.
Ah!
The sweet smell of victory.
I knew you could do it, Batman!
No!
This is wrong.
Whale's the only one who was committing a crime.
We thought we were doing the right thing!
Excuses excuses.
Just like the people who ruined my life made excuses, when they pulled me into their war.
Well, it won't happen to Ernie.
When I worked for Whale I watched Ernie take the fall and did nothing!
Now I'm correcting my mistake.
Where am I?
Who are all of you?
These are the people who took you away from your family, Ernie!
Who framed you.
I brought them here for your revenge.
What are you waiting for?
Take them out!
I don't wanna hurt anyone.
I just wanna go home to my wife and daughter.
You will Ernie.
We'll help you.
No!
He's a liar!
This is game over, Batman!
You're forgetting your own rule, Humpty.
That everyone responsible for what happened to Ernie would be punished.
You never spoke up for Ernie when you had the chance.
You're as guilty as we are.
No!
no!
You're twisting my rule!
This is my game and I'm the winner.
Oh-oh.
You're still trapped and without me you'll never get out alive.
Huh?
Oh, no!
Now it's game over.
Is Dumpty secure?
Yes.
When Humpty Dumpty wakes up from that great fall, he'll be riding in a cell at Black Gate.
Whale, you'll be moving into Ernie's cell.
Obstruction of justice and weapons' smuggling on top of your previous crimes.
I think that's grounds for having your bail revoked.
Go.
I'll handle Dent and the police.
Back to the mansion?
- For me, I'm going alone.
- Alone?
Why?
Did I do something wrong?
In the library, once I decide on a plan, it's not up for discussion.
I thought you were becoming more interested in beating Humpty Dumpty, then the safety of Gordon and the others.
- I chose the right course of action.
- This time.
I just thought that what we do, we do for Gotham and its people.
Their safety comes first.
Even Bruce Wayne would agree with that.
I'm not Bruce Wayne.
Previously on Gracepoint...
I have this thing.
I get messages.
She says she forgives you about the pendant.
If you delete something from a hard drive, is it gone forever?
Tom?
What are you doing?
You have no alibi for the night of Danny's death.
Have you thought more about the baby?
I know what you did.
Tell me everything.
Shut your mouth!
- Dad, look, it's Danny's.
- Put it down.
Who took my dog?
Archie!

Now, we have Susan Wright in custody.
We have her connected to the site where Danny's body was found.
We're contin...
I'm continuing to question her, but we're running out of time before we have to charge her with something.
We have to find her dog.

You both decided you want the baby.
Why not go to the ultrasound to get to see your child growing?
It should be wonderful.
Yeah, it should be.

Open to what, talking to a stranger?
Probably like a little friend of his.
You think I want to do that?
Why are you doing this?
Because I love you, Mark, I love you.
Don't you get that?
Oh, my God, I don't care.
I do not care.
I don't care about Paul, all right?
I just want us to be okay, you and me.
Please tell me that is possible.
Oh, hey, Tom.
You look healed, walking well.
Can I please have my computer back?
It's sitting in my office.
I haven't been sure what to do with it.
How about you just give it back?
Have you talked to your mom about why you were smashing it?
You know, I listen to people's secrets all the time.
It's part of my job.
Was something on there about Danny?
About that backpacker, pierson?
That's got nothing to do with it.
Are you trying to protect someone?
You need to tell me the truth, Tom.
Otherwise, I'll have to have a talk with your mom or Detective Carver.
You do that, and I'll tell them you hit Danny on the camping trip.
Why would you tell them that?
Tom, you need to think about what you just said.
You're the one that needs to think about it.
Tom.
Tom!
You are the last person that I expected to call.
I thought nothing was a surprise to you.
Is that what you came here for, to make fun of me?
What do you want?
Prove to me you're for real.
I did already.
I told you about the pendant.
That she forgives you.
What does that mean?
I think you know what it means.
I could see it when I first said it.
I can see it now.
That's what I'm getting from you.
That...
And you've been here before.
- Excuse me?
- You have.
You've been here in Gracepoint before.
I'm right, aren't I?
The Solano case...
I'll take anything, because I'm running out of time, so if you have something, please give it to me now.
Okay.
Thank you.
The message from Danny about it being close to home...
That felt the strongest.
What does that mean?
Close geographically?
Family, friends, what?
I don't know.
Just don't ignore it.
- Detective Carver.
- No.
You don't even know what I want.
I know the answer:
No.
- How you feeling?
- Why?
Since you left the hospital, how are you feeling?
You want to tell me what you're doing?
You were rushed to the hospital last night, and you checked yourself out this morning.
That's not the first time you've done that.
My instincts tell me your health is your own business.
Help me follow my instincts.
What do you want?
An exclusive.
On what?
Here's what I'm struggling with.
I know these cliffs.
I've lived here all my life.
If you're walking your dog, you can't see straight down.
Unless you go right up to the edge and lean over, you couldn't have seen Danny's body.
It's the wrong angle.
You don't believe me, that's your problem.
I'm convinced you saw more than you're saying.
I didn't see anything.
Just like you didn't see what your husband was up to.
You want me to believe that if only you knew, you would have said something to save your daughters, so tell me what you know about Danny Solano.
What did you see?
A boat.
I wasn't up on the cliff.
I was down on the beach.
I saw a boat come in.
(Ellie) How many people on board?
- (Susan) One.
- (Ellie) That's it?
Yeah, took the boy's body out of the boat, laid it down on the beach.
Then he got back in the boat and took off.
Did you recognize the person who laid Danny's body on the beach?
I did.
His name is Vince.
He works with the boy's dad.
[Police radio chatter]
You have the right to remain silent.
(Vince) I won't be gone long, ma.
Just stay inside, all right?
[Ellie murmuring]
(Vince) I'll be right back, ma, okay?
[Dog barking]
So he likes weapons, knew Danny well, built his skateboard, right?
I think so.
Tom's too.
Is after Mark for a raise.
What else?
Any history of violence, mental health issues?
He's had a very rough time at home.
No dad, no siblings.
He's had to care for his mom on his own.
She said something very strange to me at the house.
She said that Vince loved Danny and that he put him on his arm.
- What does that mean?
- I asked, did he pick him up?
Did he carry him around?
Maybe did she mean when he was little?
She couldn't answer.
She's very in and out.
Do you know this woman, Vince?
No.
Did you build a skateboard for Tom Miller?
Yeah.
- How about Danny Solano?
- Him too.
Why did this woman have the skateboard
- you built for Danny?
- I don't know.
- You didn't give it to her?
- No.
Do you own a dog, Vince?
- Not really.
- Not really?
What, you own one sometimes?
This funny to you?
No, it's not funny.
Why was there a dog in your garage?
Someone asked me to watch him for them.
This woman, Susan Wright, who you say you don't know, hmm?
If you're gonna lie to me, Vince, at least have the respect to lie well.
The night of Danny Solano's death, first you were with Mark, and then you weren't.
Then you were home with your mom, but then she fell asleep after you gave her cough medicine, so we still have no clear idea where you were.
I don't know her.
Can I please see your arms, Vince?
You want to see my arms?
Your tattoos.
Take your shirt off.
Now the other one.
Got it after he died.
You put the name of your boss' son on your right arm?
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
That was great, Mrs. Solano.
Thank you.
Just call me Beth, please.
Mrs. Solano makes me feel like I'm Mark's mother.
Oh, yeah, none of us want that.
[Laughter]
Well, I got you something.
For me?
For all of you, the family, for letting me in.
Mostly for the new baby.
It's so soft.
Thank you.
It's the first one.
- I'm sorry if I...
- No, it's all right, buddy.
Just kind of a big day.
- You're all right, though, right, babe?
- Mm-hmm.
Should we bring Pete some dessert, ask him about Vince?
I already, um, talked to him before we ate.
There's no new news.
It's not Vince, dad.
You know it isn't.
- I mean, do I?
- Mark.
No, I mean, I just don't know what to think anymore.
Like, he's been asking me for a raise every week since last summer.
So what are you saying, that he would take that out on Danny?
He wouldn't do that.
Chloe's right.
I went out hunting with them once, and the way the two of them were just joking around, nonstop talking, you would think they were brothers.
Wait, he...
Th-they went hunting?
When was this?
A while ago, like...
October, November.
I mean, they said they'd been out before.
They said you knew.
We didn't know.
Is this yours, Vince?
Yeah.
What'd you use it for?
I hunt.
Did you spend a lot of time with Danny?
Yeah, he... he was my friend's son, so...
Yeah, your friend who called in, who said you took his son hunting without his parents' permission.
Did you take Danny out hunting the night he died?
No, no, I didn't.
Uh-huh.
Let's talk about the skateboard.
Did you charge Danny for it?
The kids all paid me.
Right, makes up for the money you're not getting from Mark.
What is this?
Mark pays me fine.
Yeah?
How do you know Susan Wright?
I don't know her.
I've told her to leave me alone, but she just keeps harassing me.
Susan Wright has told us she believes you killed Danny Solano.
That's insane.
Did you kill Danny Solano?
Did you use the butt of your rifle and smash his head in?
I would never do that!
Why would I kill my friend's son?
You tell me.
Why does Susan Wright think you did?
What's she got to harass you about?
Vince.
She says she's my mother.
[Machine pulsing softly]
I told you...
They took him away from me when everything happened.
I never knew where he ended up, whether he was all right.
Then the law changed.
It was okay to make contact.
Took me 18 months to track him down.
No one ever told me I was adopted, not till she showed up.
The lady who adopted him, she hid all the letters I sent.
Never got one response.
Turns out she's lost her mind, dementia, but she knew what she was doing.
He thought she was his real mother until I tracked him down.
Now, that's not right, not at all.
(Susan) If I'd known how things would go,
I might've handled it differently.
He...
Didn't want anything to do with me.
Pushed me away, shut me out.
(Vince) She doesn't belong here.
With everything that's happened, it's too much to handle.
When you took home that skateboard...
Did you know he had made it?
Yeah, I thought he might want it back, that if I took it, he'd have to talk to me.
She kept saying that I needed her, that we needed each other.
I thought I was protecting him.
You sure she's not the one who killed Danny?
Because she's that sick.
She lies about everything.
(Ellie) Does he know about your family, about what happened?
Don't you dare tell him.
Okay.
But here's where I'm confused, Susan.
If Vince is your son and you want to be reconciled, why tell us you saw him at the beach that Thursday night?
I'm a mom too, and I'm sure whatever my child did,
I would want to protect him.
Well, I am protecting him.
Don't you get that?
I see how angry he is, and I'm scared for him, other kids.
It's not his fault, but it's clear just looking at him.
That boy is his father's son.
He murdered that child.
(Susan) So what else is he capable of?
Who's he gonna hurt next?
[Vince chuckles]
She lies about everything.
She claims that I'm her son.
That bitch is insane.
Why would you believe anything she says?
There are articles in here about her...
Her husband, and their children.
I think you might want to read them.
(Ellie) You did what?
He deserved to see it, and it could help us.
- I promised her.
- Well, you shouldn't have.
We need everything out now.
We need to cut through what's linked to Danny and what isn't.
These are people's lives you're screwing with.
I should file a complaint.
Go ahead.
Add it to the list.
I'll sign it.
Vince is our prime suspect.
He had a weapon, a family history of violence.
He was seen with the body.
Anything I can do to break him down,
I'm gonna do.
You should have let her tell him.
You should have waited.
What else should we wait for, huh?
- We're running out of time.
- You might be.
- I'm sorry.
- Look at this.
The call from last night telling us the light was on at the hut... the trace came back.
It's Danny's cell, the missing smart phone.
My God, Danny's killer called in.
Why would they do that?
Why tell us where they are and then take off?
It's like they're trying to provoke us.
[Phone ringing]

Carver here.
Yeah.
All right, all right.
I'll be right there.
(Paul) This is Tom Miller's laptop, or was.
I caught him smashing it in his driveway.
You just stumbled across him?
Happens a lot these days.
I was on my way home.
That's the route I take.
Any idea... why he'd destroy it, what he was trying to get rid of?
I tried to get him to tell me.
You think it had to do with Danny?
Honestly, my sense is, Tom's scared.
He and Danny were best friends, but they'd been growing apart.
Why do you say that?
I'd seen it, overheard things at Sunday school.
Danny quit his dad's team.
Tom made fun of him for doing that... normal 12-year-old stuff.
But that doesn't mean he's not afraid that you'd make more out of it.
Detective Miller never said anything.
She might not have known.
I should let you know, Tom threatened to tell you that I hit Danny if I handed this over.
And did you hit Danny?
I did not.
I need a favor, quick and discreet.
Things are complicated here.

No.

You'll need to report in to us every evening at 6:00.
Shouldn't be a problem.
Why do you keep looking at me like that?
Back then, in your own house, how could you not know?
Your husband, your child.
Come on.
(Emmett) We knew we had the right guy.
The trial was underway, but the evidence was circumstantial.
And then we tracked down a car that he'd sold before his arrest.
One of my detectives found the pendant belonging to one of the girls.
There were prints on it, our smoking gun.
My detective was taking the bag of evidence back to the station, and she stopped at a hotel on the way for a drink...
And her car was broken into.
CD player, GPS, all taken.
Quick in and out.
Kids probably.
- And the pendant.
- Yeah.
We couldn't make the case after that.
He's still out there.
Why'd she stop at a hotel?
[Ahem]
She was having an affair with one of the other detectives on the team.
They thought they'd celebrate.
Renee's coverage, all the papers, they said it was you who lost the evidence, your car.
Happened on my watch.
(Owen) Right, but that detective...
She was my wife.
We have a daughter.
I didn't want her knowing that about her mother.
Those parents think it's your fault.
That's an enormous strain.
People deserve to know about this.
Do they really?
Do me a favor.
Tell the families first.

The night Danny was killed, I was... well, I admit it.
I was driving back after drinking too much.
I took hill road through the woods, and I saw, as I came up the slope towards the shore, a Solano plumbing truck parked off the road in the trees.
I saw a man with a wool hat come around the side carrying something heavy wrapped in a tarp.
I didn't see his face.
You're only telling me this just now?
It was the only thing of value I had left.
Plus I'd had more than a few drinks, and I wasn't completely sure.

I went because I was scared, because I woke up this morning, and I knew we had this ultrasound today, and I didn't want to go.
So we're back to this?
- You said you want the baby.
- I do want it.
Then what's the problem?
- I want it to be happy.
- Oh.
I want it to have a happy family, not...
Whatever we have turned into, broken, miserable, fighting.
Oh, is that what you told Paul?
Pretending one trip to the Bowling Alley fixes everything.
What else did you tell him?
You tell him about Gemma, 'cause now he's gonna act all holy when he's trying to get in your pants.
- He's not trying to get in my pants.
- Yeah.
And he's looking to break us up.
Oh, my God, if you would please just listen.
He told me that he is not the right person to counsel me about our marriage, and he gave me a card, someone in winstead that we can go to.
Yeah, a shrink.
A psychiatrist, someone who deals with loss.
Have fun.
Mark, please, will you just be open to it?
Open to what, talking to a stranger?
Probably like a little friend of his.
You think I want to do that?
Why are you doing this?
Because I love you, Mark, I love you.
Don't you get that?
Oh, my God, I don't care.
I do not care.
I don't care about Paul, all right?
I just want us to be okay, you and me.
Please tell me that is possible.
Oh, hey, Tom.
You look healed, walking well.
Can I please have my computer back?
It's sitting in my office.
I haven't been sure what to do with it.
How about you just give it back?
Have you talked to your mom about why you were smashing it?
You know, I listen to people's secrets all the time.
It's part of my job.
Was something on there about Danny?
About that backpacker, pierson?
That's got nothing to do with it.
Are you trying to protect someone?
You need to tell me the truth, Tom.
Otherwise, I'll have to have a talk with your mom or Detective Carver.
You do that, and I'll tell them you hit Danny on the camping trip.
Why would you tell them that?
Tom, you need to think about what you just said.
You're the one that needs to think about it.
Tom.
Tom!
You are the last person that I expected to call.
I thought nothing was a surprise to you.
Is that what you came here for, to make fun of me?
What do you want?
Prove to me you're for real.
I did already.
I told you about the pendant.
That she forgives you.
What does that mean?
I think you know what it means.
I could see it when I first said it.
I can see it now.
That's what I'm getting from you.
That...
And you've been here before.
- Excuse me?
- You have.
You've been here in Gracepoint before.
I'm right, aren't I?
The Solano case...
I'll take anything, because I'm running out of time, so if you have something, please give it to me now.
Okay.
Thank you.
The message from Danny about it being close to home...
That felt the strongest.
What does that mean?
Close geographically?
Family, friends, what?
I don't know.
Just don't ignore it.
- Detective Carver.
- No.
You don't even know what I want.
I know the answer:
No.
- How you feeling?
- Why?
Since you left the hospital, how are you feeling?
You want to tell me what you're doing?
You were rushed to the hospital last night, and you checked yourself out this morning.
That's not the first time you've done that.
My instincts tell me your health is your own business.
Help me follow my instincts.
What do you want?
An exclusive.
On what?
Here's what I'm struggling with.
I know these cliffs.
I've lived here all my life.
If you're walking your dog, you can't see straight down.
Unless you go right up to the edge and lean over, you couldn't have seen Danny's body.
It's the wrong angle.
You don't believe me, that's your problem.
I'm convinced you saw more than you're saying.
I didn't see anything.
Just like you didn't see what your husband was up to.
You want me to believe that if only you knew, you would have said something to save your daughters, so tell me what you know about Danny Solano.
What did you see?
A boat.
I wasn't up on the cliff.
I was down on the beach.
I saw a boat come in.
(Ellie) How many people on board?
- (Susan) One.
- (Ellie) That's it?
Yeah, took the boy's body out of the boat, laid it down on the beach.
Then he got back in the boat and took off.
Did you recognize the person who laid Danny's body on the beach?
I did.
His name is Vince.
He works with the boy's dad.
[Police radio chatter]
You have the right to remain silent.
(Vince) I won't be gone long, ma.
Just stay inside, all right?
[Ellie murmuring]
(Vince) I'll be right back, ma, okay?
[Dog barking]
So he likes weapons, knew Danny well, built his skateboard, right?
I think so.
Tom's too.
Is after Mark for a raise.
What else?
Any history of violence, mental health issues?
He's had a very rough time at home.
No dad, no siblings.
He's had to care for his mom on his own.
She said something very strange to me at the house.
She said that Vince loved Danny and that he put him on his arm.
- What does that mean?
- I asked, did he pick him up?
Did he carry him around?
Maybe did she mean when he was little?
She couldn't answer.
She's very in and out.
Do you know this woman, Vince?
No.
Did you build a skateboard for Tom Miller?
Yeah.
- How about Danny Solano?
- Him too.
Why did this woman have the skateboard
- you built for Danny?
- I don't know.
- You didn't give it to her?
- No.
Do you own a dog, Vince?
- Not really.
- Not really?
What, you own one sometimes?
This funny to you?
No, it's not funny.
Why was there a dog in your garage?
Someone asked me to watch him for them.
This woman, Susan Wright, who you say you don't know, hmm?
If you're gonna lie to me, Vince, at least have the respect to lie well.
The night of Danny Solano's death, first you were with Mark, and then you weren't.
Then you were home with your mom, but then she fell asleep after you gave her cough medicine, so we still have no clear idea where you were.
I don't know her.
Can I please see your arms, Vince?
You want to see my arms?
Your tattoos.
Take your shirt off.
Now the other one.
Got it after he died.
You put the name of your boss' son on your right arm?
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
That was great, Mrs. Solano.
Thank you.
Just call me Beth, please.
Mrs. Solano makes me feel like I'm Mark's mother.
Oh, yeah, none of us want that.
[Laughter]
Well, I got you something.
For me?
For all of you, the family, for letting me in.
Mostly for the new baby.
It's so soft.
Thank you.
It's the first one.
- I'm sorry if I...
- No, it's all right, buddy.
Just kind of a big day.
- You're all right, though, right, babe?
- Mm-hmm.
Should we bring Pete some dessert, ask him about Vince?
I already, um, talked to him before we ate.
There's no new news.
It's not Vince, dad.
You know it isn't.
- I mean, do I?
- Mark.
No, I mean, I just don't know what to think anymore.
Like, he's been asking me for a raise every week since last summer.
So what are you saying, that he would take that out on Danny?
He wouldn't do that.
Chloe's right.
I went out hunting with them once, and the way the two of them were just joking around, nonstop talking, you would think they were brothers.
Wait, he...
Th-they went hunting?
When was this?
A while ago, like...
October, November.
I mean, they said they'd been out before.
They said you knew.
We didn't know.
Is this yours, Vince?
Yeah.
What'd you use it for?
I hunt.
Did you spend a lot of time with Danny?
Yeah, he... he was my friend's son, so...
Yeah, your friend who called in, who said you took his son hunting without his parents' permission.
Did you take Danny out hunting the night he died?
No, no, I didn't.
Uh-huh.
Let's talk about the skateboard.
Did you charge Danny for it?
The kids all paid me.
Right, makes up for the money you're not getting from Mark.
What is this?
Mark pays me fine.
Yeah?
How do you know Susan Wright?
I don't know her.
I've told her to leave me alone, but she just keeps harassing me.
Susan Wright has told us she believes you killed Danny Solano.
That's insane.
Did you kill Danny Solano?
Did you use the butt of your rifle and smash his head in?
I would never do that!
Why would I kill my friend's son?
You tell me.
Why does Susan Wright think you did?
What's she got to harass you about?
Vince.
She says she's my mother.
[Machine pulsing softly]
I told you...
They took him away from me when everything happened.
I never knew where he ended up, whether he was all right.
Then the law changed.
It was okay to make contact.
Took me 18 months to track him down.
No one ever told me I was adopted, not till she showed up.
The lady who adopted him, she hid all the letters I sent.
Never got one response.
Turns out she's lost her mind, dementia, but she knew what she was doing.
He thought she was his real mother until I tracked him down.
Now, that's not right, not at all.
(Susan) If I'd known how things would go,
I might've handled it differently.
He...
Didn't want anything to do with me.
Pushed me away, shut me out.
(Vince) She doesn't belong here.
With everything that's happened, it's too much to handle.
When you took home that skateboard...
Did you know he had made it?
Yeah, I thought he might want it back, that if I took it, he'd have to talk to me.
She kept saying that I needed her, that we needed each other.
I thought I was protecting him.
You sure she's not the one who killed Danny?
Because she's that sick.
She lies about everything.
(Ellie) Does he know about your family, about what happened?
Don't you dare tell him.
Okay.
But here's where I'm confused, Susan.
If Vince is your son and you want to be reconciled, why tell us you saw him at the beach that Thursday night?
I'm a mom too, and I'm sure whatever my child did,
I would want to protect him.
Well, I am protecting him.
Don't you get that?
I see how angry he is, and I'm scared for him, other kids.
It's not his fault, but it's clear just looking at him.
That boy is his father's son.
He murdered that child.
(Susan) So what else is he capable of?
Who's he gonna hurt next?
[Vince chuckles]
She lies about everything.
She claims that I'm her son.
That bitch is insane.
Why would you believe anything she says?
There are articles in here about her...
Her husband, and their children.
I think you might want to read them.
(Ellie) You did what?
He deserved to see it, and it could help us.
- I promised her.
- Well, you shouldn't have.
We need everything out now.
We need to cut through what's linked to Danny and what isn't.
These are people's lives you're screwing with.
I should file a complaint.
Go ahead.
Add it to the list.
I'll sign it.
Vince is our prime suspect.
He had a weapon, a family history of violence.
He was seen with the body.
Anything I can do to break him down,
I'm gonna do.
You should have let her tell him.
You should have waited.
What else should we wait for, huh?
- We're running out of time.
- You might be.
- I'm sorry.
- Look at this.
The call from last night telling us the light was on at the hut... the trace came back.
It's Danny's cell, the missing smart phone.
My God, Danny's killer called in.
Why would they do that?
Why tell us where they are and then take off?
It's like they're trying to provoke us.
[Phone ringing]
[Click]
Carver here.
Yeah.
All right, all right.
I'll be right there.
(Paul) This is Tom Miller's laptop, or was.
I caught him smashing it in his driveway.
You just stumbled across him?
Happens a lot these days.
I was on my way home.
That's the route I take.
Any idea... why he'd destroy it, what he was trying to get rid of?
I tried to get him to tell me.
You think it had to do with Danny?
Honestly, my sense is, Tom's scared.
He and Danny were best friends, but they'd been growing apart.
Why do you say that?
I'd seen it, overheard things at Sunday school.
Danny quit his dad's team.
Tom made fun of him for doing that... normal 12-year-old stuff.
But that doesn't mean he's not afraid that you'd make more out of it.
Detective Miller never said anything.
She might not have known.
I should let you know, Tom threatened to tell you that I hit Danny if I handed this over.
And did you hit Danny?
I did not.
I need a favor, quick and discreet.
Things are complicated here.
How are you with damaged hard drives?

What about Vince?
Vince is staying.
Does he know about our family?
He was told.

Tell them you made a mistake.
Tell them you lied about seeing me there that night, then get out of my life.
I'm so lonely, Vince.
Just be sweet to me, son.
If you don't tell them that you lied and then leave this town, as soon as I get out of here,
I'm gonna slit your dog's throat, then I'm gonna come after you.

You're just like your father!
You're sick, just like him.
That's enough.
Enough.
Let's go.
You've got him in you.
It was you I saw that night.
It was you!
[Metal door clanks]
(Emmett) There's not much I can tell you.
I was pursuing a suspect.
There was an incident, and I was injured.
Can you name the suspect?
No.
Give us time to close this case.
We're almost there.
Like you were in Rosemont.
I'm sorry?
In Rosemont, you had your guy.
Case fell apart.
Why don't you tell us what went wrong?
Why don't you ask your friend Renee Clemons?
Or just read what she wrote?
She had it all covered.
(Kathy) All?
Rene thinks you're hiding something, that there's more to the story.
Does she?
Why don't you let us decide if there's more?
Unless you'd prefer that all of Gracepoint learn about your hospital visit.
So you're threatening me?
There must be some part of you that's sick of having a secret.
Keeping a secret like that's exhausting, weighs on your heart.
Hey!
Oh, at least you love me.
Yes, you do.
You'll need to report in to us every evening at 6:00.
Shouldn't be a problem.
Why do you keep looking at me like that?
Back then, in your own house, how could you not know?
Your husband, your child.
Come on.
(Emmett) We knew we had the right guy.
The trial was underway, but the evidence was circumstantial.
And then we tracked down a car that he'd sold before his arrest.
One of my detectives found the pendant belonging to one of the girls.
There were prints on it, our smoking gun.
My detective was taking the bag of evidence back to the station, and she stopped at a hotel on the way for a drink...
And her car was broken into.
CD player, GPS, all taken.
Quick in and out.
Kids probably.
- And the pendant.
- Yeah.
We couldn't make the case after that.
He's still out there.
Why'd she stop at a hotel?
[Ahem]
She was having an affair with one of the other detectives on the team.
They thought they'd celebrate.
Renee's coverage, all the papers, they said it was you who lost the evidence, your car.
Happened on my watch.
(Owen) Right, but that detective...
She was my wife.
We have a daughter.
I didn't want her knowing that about her mother.
Those parents think it's your fault.
That's an enormous strain.
People deserve to know about this.
Do they really?
Do me a favor.
Tell the families first.
Tell them I haven't given up on their daughters.
The Rosemont case is still open.
Then do whatever you want.
Put it on your front page.
Let Renee know she was right.
Just please don't name that detective.
That's all I ask.
I'm done.
- Miller!
- Yup.

Uh... [papers rustling] 10.
So what?
Susan did see Vince?
We're back in with him first thing in the morning.
By the way, Tom and Danny...
How close were they actually?
They were best friends.
Paul Coates said there were tensions.
They were drifting apart.
What?
When did he say this?
Just today.
You know, you do this when you get desperate.
You lash out at people.
When was the last time Danny was at your house?
It's 2:00 A.M. I don't know.
A month before he died, two months?
Maybe longer.
Can we borrow Tom's computer?
Would you bring it in tomorrow?
Fine.
Have a good night.
[Whispering] What are you doing?
[Whispering] Where is his computer?
Can't this wait till the morning?
It should be here.
Where is it?
We'll find it tomorrow.
That's what you always say:
"We'll do it tomorrow.
We'll find it tomorrow.
We'll do it tomorrow."
What are you mad at me for?
- I didn't do anything.
- I know.
You never do anything, and I feel like I'm carrying... oh, I just... all I do is work, and all I do is worry, and you... you haven't even painted this room.
It's been months.
What...
Do you do all day?
[Phone vibrating]
It's my sister.
What does she want?
You got it?
[Paper rustles]
Oh, I knew you'd come through, my softy sister.
Wouldn't let me get evicted for missing rent again.
Okay, Sara, we're running out of time, okay?
My boss, I think, is being let go tomorrow, and I'm scared another child is gonna get hurt, so tell me what you saw.
The night Danny was killed, I was... well, I admit it.
I was driving back after drinking too much.
I took hill road through the woods, and I saw, as I came up the slope towards the shore, a Solano plumbing truck parked off the road in the trees.
I saw a man with a wool hat come around the side carrying something heavy wrapped in a tarp.
I didn't see his face.
You're only telling me this just now?
It was the only thing of value I had left.
Plus I'd had more than a few drinks, and I wasn't completely sure.
I don't know if it was Mark or not, but it was definitely his van.
It wasn't Mark.
I know who drives that van.

NARRATOR:
Thebiggestleak of government secrets ever began in December of 2012 with a single email delivered to an
IP address in Rio de Janeiro.
GlennGreenwald,oneofthe world's busiest journalists, is sitting in his home in Rio, and he sees an email from someone he doesn't know-- it's not a friend, it's not his mom--
and it just says, "I've got some stuff you might be interested in."
Hedidn'tusehis name, and he said very cryptically and very vaguely that he had information that he wanted to discuss with me, but could only do so if I were to install encryption.
NARRATOR:
Guardiannewspaper columnist and blogger Glenn
Greenwald didn't pay much attention to the email.
99%ofthetime,it ends up that they're crazy or delusional, or the story is just not very good.
Andthisguyorgirl-- we don't know who it is-- is persistent, so a few days later emails again and says,
"Look, Glenn, can you do this thing?"
And Glenn still doesn't do it.
This attempt, basically, to leak all of these secrets initially just goes straight into the sand.
NARRATOR:
Thesourcemoved on, this time to Berlin.
He was soon exchanging emails with American documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras.
Shehadbeenincontactfor over a month with a mysterious source who had reached out to her using her encryption key and using anonymous channels, and said he had a big story for her.
NARRATOR:
A fewweekslater in New York, Poitras met national security investigative reporter Barton Gellman at a
Greenwich Village restaurant.
Thiswassomethingshe wanted to be exceptioionally careful about.
We agreed on a cafe to meet at.
We also, I think, both understood that when we got there, we'd move to someplace else.
NARRATOR:
Poitrasasked
Gellman to vet the source and meet him electronically.
Hersource,whobecamealso my source, needed to take very special precautions in the usual NSA style.
And so he called me Brass Banner.
And he called himself Verax, which means "truth teller" in Latin.
NARRATOR:
Through sophisticated encrypted messages, Verax promised an unprecedented scoop.
But it came with a warning.
Hebelievedhe wasrisking his freedom and possibly his life.
And he warned me as well that if the U.S. intelligence community believed that by getting rid of me they could prevent the story from happening, he said that my life would be at risk.
NARRATOR:
InlateMay ,
Verax surprised Gellman and Poitras.
He sent them an invitation.
Hesaid,"Your destination is Hong Kong."
NARRATOR:
Poitras wanted to go.
Barton Gellman, worried about a secret meeting in a foreign country like China, decided not to.
But Poitras knew someone who might join her.
That spring, Glenn Greenwald arrived in New York to deliver a speech.
Andwemetthatnight in my hotel, in the lobby.
And she showed me these emails that she had been exchanging with this person who was claiming that he was a National
Security state insider with access to very sensitive information that he believed to be very incriminating, and stated very definitively that he wanted to turn it over to her and to me.
NARRATOR:
Greenwald decided to join Poitras.
Weallknewthatthis was incredibly risky and uncertain, but the story had to be reported.
NARRATOR:
InJune, Poitras and Greenwald headed to the airport.
Ithinkthey'rekindofquite excited, but there's also a sort of feeling that maybe this is just the most terrific hoax.
NARRATOR:
Theywerejoinedby
Ewen MacAskill, a veteran
Guardian reporter.
Atthetime,Ididn 'tthink it was for real, didn't take it that seriously, and thought it was a slightly obscure story.
NARRATOR:
Oncethey were finally airborne,
Poitras thought it was safe to share with Greenwald something the source had securely sent to her.
Andthat'skind of quite a moment.
They're in a secure space, and so Laura creeps forward to go and see Glenn.
Laurawhipsoutthisthumb drive and in a very sort of almost mischievous way says, you know, "Guess what this is?"
and told me that she had just received a fairly large archive of documents.
Theykindof can'tcontrol their excitement because this is clearly the biggest story that anyone has worked on since the Pentagon Papers in the 1970s.
Ididn'tsleepone second for the next 16 hours because the adrenaline made that impossible to do, because I not only saw the magnitude of the documents, just the sheer quantity.
The fact that we had in our possession thousands, not dozens or hundreds, but many thousands of top secret NSA documents that were about a wide range of surveillance activities, that came directly from some of the most sensitive areas of the Agency.
Icouldseeout ofthecorner of my eye Glenn with the light on throughout this 13-hour flight reading on his laptop all the time, Laura coming to see him, them having chats, and
Glenn getting more and more excited.
Weessentiallycouldn't believe what it was that we had.
And that was really the first time I think I fully understood that this was going to be unlike any other story, really ever, in American journalism or politics.
NARRATOR:
InHongKong,
Greenwald and the others traveled to a hotel in Kowloon.
Snowden'sinstructionsto
Glenn and Laura are like a kind of magical mystery tour crossed with something out of John LeCarre.
He tells them to go to a hotel, the Mira Hotel in Hong Kong, and says that he will meet them in a less-trafficked part of the hotel, next to a shopping mall, by a bench and a crocodile.
Wehadstillnoidea ofwho he was, what his age was, what his race was.
We knew nothing about him demographically at all.
And so the plan that he picked was that he would be holding a Rubik's Cube in his hand so that when he entered the room, we would immediately know who he was.
Allofasudden,this guy comes past with a Rubik's Cube-- scrambled up, which was part of the code-- but the man before them is not what they'd expected.
They'd expected some grizzled
CIA veteran wearing a blue blazer, maybe with a bit of dandruff, with a tie, receding grey hair.
And they get this callow, sort of thin-limbed student type who looks as if he's just out of high school.
And he is their source.
And he's supposedly the guy who has got the crown jewels.
Whenthis29-year-oldkid who looks a lot younger shows up, it was extremely disorienting and introduced a real awkwardness to our interaction, and kind of a shock.
NARRATOR:
EdwardSnowdenled the group upstairs to his room.
Inhisbedroombythedoor, he'd piled pillows as high up the door jambs as he could, and pillows along the bottom.
So if somebody was outside eavesdropping, it would make it harder for them.
Therewasalwaysthiskind of uncertainty, one might even say danger, hovering over the room, especially for the first few days, because we didn't know what the NSA knew about what he was doing.
So we thought it was very possible that the door could be barged down at any moment and someone could enter to arrest Snowden.
NARRATOR:
Theypainstakingly debriefed Snowden for days.
At one point, Guardian reporter
Ewen MacAskill sent a text message to his editor in New York, Janine Gibson.
JanineknewthatIliked Guinness, so she said,
"If Snowden is for real, send me a message and just say,
'The Guinness is good.'"
I was 100% sure that Snowden and the documents were for real, and I sent a message to Janine saying, "The Guinness is good."
NARRATOR:
Thedocuments
Snowden delivered revealed the history and details of one of the United States government's most closely guarded secrets.
It was known as "The Program."

EverybodyhadtheTVon, because the TV is where the news was.
It wasn't coming out of NSA's computers.
It was on the TV, because we had missed the entire event.
Thisisalivepicture.
We are seeing the second...
Itwasan enormousshockthat you have this huge agency set up to prevent a surprise attack, and they learn about it on a
$300 television set tuned to CNN in the director's office.
NARRATOR:
AttheWhite House, there was chaos.
A near total evacuation.
SecretServiceburstsinto the vice president's office, basically frog marches him by one arm and the seat of his pants into this deep underground shelter that was built to withstand nuclear war.
NARRATOR:
Almostimmediately,
Cheney directed his lawyer David
Addington to prepare the case for the president to exercise his unilateral authority as commander in chief.
DavidAddington, principally the vice president, was interested in ensuring that the president's constitutional authority was used to its fullest.
Cheneysays,"I wantyou to tell me what powers we're going to need, the President is going to need, that he doesn't already have to respond to this calamity."
Andtheydecidethatthey 're going to push every boundary they have.
Addington at one point says,
"We're going to push and push and push until some larger force makes us stop."

NARRATOR:
OnSeptember12 at NSA headquarters, the mood was somber.
Wheredidit allbegin?
Webegansoulsearching almost immediately.
We all felt like a great wrong had been done and that we were all somewhat if not all culpable.
Adatethatwill live in infamy.
Youhaveto rememberthat
NSA was created after World War
II to prevent another surprise attack.
That was the whole raison d'etre for NSA:
Pearl Harbor.
We don't want another Pearl Harbor.
Morepeopleinvolvedinthe plot remain in the United States...
Immediatelywebeganto wonder what we had done wrong, why did we miss the boat, what didn't we detect that we should have detected?
Theinvestigation continues in this country...
NARRATOR:
Intheaftermath, troubling questions emerged from deep inside the agency.
Hadlivedfor at least a year...
NARRATOR:
Whyhadn'tthe NSA been able to connect the dots?
Itwasavery cautious agency.
It's an agency that is fighting with one hand tied behind its back out of fear of a political backlash by being too aggressive.
ThePresident now at the door...
NARRATOR:
Duringthe Nixon administration.
Afinalwave...
NARRATOR:
The NSA had overstepped: spied on Americans.
Certainlyappearsto violate the 4th Amendment to the Constitution.
NARRATOR:
Caughtand restricted by Congress, the domestic spying apparatus went dark for more than 20 years.
It was against the law to turn the NSA on Americans.
IfyouwereanNSAanalyst, this sort of legal regime was drilled into your head to the point where a lot of people said, "It's made the rules too restrictive and it's hampered the NSA's ability to detect terrorist plots."
NARRATOR:
Someat theagency thought the NSA had been overly cautious and believed the 9/11 attacks could have been stopped.
Idobelieveitcouldhave been prevented with revisions to the way we were permitted to operate before 9/11.
(voice breaking):
Revisions that
I tried to get the general counsel to embrace and wouldn't... and couldn't...
I tried to get them to make adjustments to how we were operating, how we were permitted to operate, and they wouldn't do it.
I've felt this ever since it occurred, that over 3,000 people's lives were lost.
And it's just a weight that
I am having trouble bearing.
It's...
I'm sorry, I...
Thetoughestweekfor America since Japan bombed Pearl Harbor
60 years ago...
NARRATOR:
All over
Washington, there was a growing demand to stop the next attack.
Wehaveto rememberthatwe had had terrorists living in this country for a number of months and we didn't know about it.
What else didn't we know?
And so there was a great deal of concern about the fact that we not only could not connect the dots, we could not collect the dots.
NARRATOR:
AttheCIA , director George Tenet was under pressure from the vice president.
Thedirectorhadameeting with Vice President Cheney and his top aide, David
Addington, and he was asked, "What can be done?
What can be done that isn't being done?"
9/11madenecessary a shift in policies.
Cheneysays,in effect,to
Tenet, "Make me a shopping list.
Tell me what you want to do that we're not letting you do yet."
NARRATOR:
Tenet,whoseown agency was designing covert operations against al Qaeda, called General Hayden.
Georgecallsme andsays,
"Mike, any more you can do?"
I said, "George, no, not within my authorities, not within my current authorities."
And he paused and said, "That's not actually the question I asked you.
Is there anything more you could do?"
I said, "I'll get back to you."
NARRATOR:
Hayden got the message.
At NSA headquarters, he spread the word.
"Take the gloves off.
Bring me an aggressive plan."
Andtheyaskedme, "Is there anything that we had that could have prevented 9/11?"
NARRATOR:
Loomistoldthem what he believed was necessary:
begin monitoring foreign
Internet traffic going through the United States.
TheU.S.Internethubs handle so much of the worldwide Internet traffic.
So I said, "Let us allow collection between
U.S.-and-foreign/foreign-to-U.S.
against the terrorism problem."
NARRATOR:
Butothersinthe agency were proposing much more aggressive data collection.
Whattheyproposedtodois create a whole new surveillance program without warrants, trapping all sorts of information, taking advantage of the fact that modern communication trunk lines tend to come through the United States.
Theideaof thisprogramwas you're looking for unknown conspirators, and the way they devised to do that was to look at everybody.
NARRATOR:
Itwasthe outline of something Hayden could take to the vice president.
He headed to Washington to propose the idea.
Oneoftheworstdays in American history...
NARRATOR:
Itwouldbehis first meeting in the Oval Office.
Therewasamassive sell-off on Wall Street...
Priorto9/ 11,Idon 'tthink
I knew General Hayden.
I probably knew his name.
I doubt that the president knew his name.
It'sa verybigchangefor the director of NSA to suddenly have all this attention from senior officials in the White House and so forth.
And I'm sure it had a major impact on Hayden.
NARRATOR:
Thepresident had been briefed.
He put his arm around General
Hayden, called him his childhood nickname, "Mikey."
SoI walkin to see the president.
It's the president and the vice president in the room.
Almost certainly Condi was there, as the National Security
Advisor, Andy Card would have been there.
Cheneysuggeststhequestion and George Bush asks it:
"What would you like to do that you can't already do that would help prevent another 9/11?"
NARRATOR:
Hayden outlined "The Program."
It would gather data on the phone calls and Internet traffic of hundreds of millions of
Americans, then search it for suspicious connections.
But he was worried about whether it was legal.
Andthefirstthinghesays to me is, "Mike, I understand your concerns.
But there are some things we're going to have to do, and I think
I have the authority to authorize you to do things that you've outlined."
Thepresidentsays,"Go .
I want you to go develop a program.
Come back to me.
We've got the lawyers working on it, but you have my order.
We're going to do this."
NARRATOR:
Haydenleftthe
White House knowing that
"The Program" was bound to be controversial.
Nopresidenthadauthorized it prior to this time.
And Michael Hayden goes home after briefing the president and the vice president about his ideas for expanding surveillance and takes a walk with his wife.
Andshesaid, "What's on your mind?"
I said, "Well, we're going to do something here."
And I didn't go into any details.
"We're going to do something.
One day, it's going to be public, and when it gets public, it's going to be very controversial and the people doing it are going to be swept into this thing."
And she said, "Uh-huh.
Is it the right thing to do?"
I said, "Yeah, I think so."
She said, "Okay, we'll deal with that when it comes."
NARRATOR:
OnOctober4, in a secret signing with Cheney, the president officially authorized "The Program."
Thatorderis writtenby
David Addington, the vice president's lawyer.
It's not written by the president's lawyer.
And this is not only unusual but probably unique in the history of major U.S. intelligence operations: it's written by the vice president's lawyer and stored in his own safe.
NARRATOR:
Addingtonworked out of a small office next to the White House in the old
Executive Office Building.
Thisorderis oneofthemost closely kept secrets of the
Bush/Cheney administration for four years.
It's kept so secret that many people involved in national security inside the White House and the government don't know about it.
NARRATOR:
Addington personally hand-carried a copy of the secret document out to Fort Meade.
Hesaid,"I 'mcomingout .
I'll be there in about 30 minutes."
Hand-carried.
This was very closely guarded that we were doing this.
And he comes onto the campus at
Fort Meade, up to the top deck, and hands me the order.
NARRATOR:
NowGeneralHayden wanted the sign-off of his top lawyer, Robert Deitz.
Ithinkhe wasconcernedand wanted my view of whether this program was lawful.
I spent a kind of sleepless night pondering the legality of it.
This was a very hard call.
It was a very hard call.
TheNSAhasageneralcounsel and about 100 lawyers.
And they were told, "The president has signed it, it's been certified as lawful, and once all the signatures are there, that's it, we salute.
We say, 'Okay, it's lawful, we're going to go ahead.'"
Intheintelworld,if a president says to you,
"I need this in order to keep the American people safe," you need to try to figure out where that line is constitutionally and march right up to it.
NARRATOR:
TwootherNSA lawyers would also sign off on "The Program."
Wecameto theconclusion independently but consistently that there was no doubt in our mind that it was a legitimate use of the president's Article 2 authority.
NARRATOR:
GeneralHaydenhad heard exactly what he needed.
Article 2: the president's authority as commander in chief.
Ihadmy threegoodfriends here, who have been my guardian angels on these things since I became director, saying, "This is good."
NARRATOR:
Nowthemassive collection of data could begin.
Whoisemailingwhom?
Who is texting whom?
Who is doing Skype calls with whom?
They're collecting a lot of information, a lot of content of phone calls.
They are actually recording the voices.
Not for all of our calls, but for a lot of U.S. telephone calls.
And they were doing this under an authority that had never existed before.
NARRATOR:
ItwouldbeGeneral
Hayden's most closely guarded secret.
Only a small handful of NSA employees knew what the president had authorized.
Most were kept out of the loop, including this man:
senior manager Thomas Drake.
Myfirstdayreportingonthe job was the morning of 9/11.
Hehadbeeninthemilitary, he'd been in the Air Force.
He's devoted his life to national security issues.
He's a computer genius of a sort.
NARRATOR:
Drakehadnoidea what had been going on between
Hayden and the White House.
He had been given a different task.
Iwasactuallychargedto find "Whatever you've got in the labs, whatever you've got in your agency, even if it's not operational, put it into the fight.
We need it, it might help us.
We need to deal with the threat."
NARRATOR:
Butaccordingto the rules Drake thought he had to follow, whatever he found had to safeguard Americans' privacy.
He started by digging around inside the deepest reaches of the NSA's secret RD programs.
Andhestumblesintosort of a skunkworks, and he discovers that there was actually a program before 9/11 that could have, as they said, eavesdropped on the entire world.
It's called ThinThread.
NARRATOR:
ThinThread, a program that could capture and sort massive amounts of phone and email data, was the brainchild of veteran crypto-mathematician Bill Binney.
Thewholeideawas tobuild networks around the world of everybody and who they communicate with.
Then you could isolate all the groups of terrorists.
Once you could do that, you could use that metadata to select the information from all those tens of terabytes going by.
NARRATOR:
Butto makesure the NSA would not spy on U.S.
citizens, Binney and the other analysts had built in privacy protections.
Itanonymizeswhoit's listening in on, unless there's a court warrant that makes the identity of that person clear.
IfyouknewthatitwasU.S.
person-related, it would be automatically encrypted.
That was part of the design of ThinThread.
Ithadadata privacy section.
That was working very well, protecting citizens and innocent people by encrypting the data and not allowing analysts to look at it even.
NARRATOR:
Drakewasecstatic.
The experimental program could monitor massive amounts of data, but the encryption would protect the privacy of individual Americans.
He took it upstairs to the top deck.
Inthoseshortdaysandweeks after 9/11, I put together a two-page classified implementation plan to put
ThinThread into the fight, and I presented it to Maureen Baginski.
NARRATOR:
Baginskiwas
Drake's immediate superior:
the third highest ranking official at NSA.
Ittookawhiletoget any kind of response.
He felt there was something strange going on.
Shewouldrefusetoseeme.
None of her responses were ever electronic.
None of her responses were in a form that would be recorded or saved.
Finally,hewroteamemo , sent it to her, and instead of responding electronically, which would have been normal, she wrote in a big, black felt pen.
Itwaskindofa modified cursive.
And she said, "They've gone with a different program."
WhenDrakeaskedher what this other solution was, she said, "I'm sorry, I can't tell you."
NARRATOR:
Itdidn'ttakelong for clues to emerge that something much bigger was going on.
Theystartedseeingstacksof servers piled in corners and so forth.
Sowehadtowalk wayaround all this hardware that was piling up out there.
And so we knew, you know, something was happening.
Allofasudden,peoplewho normally would communicate with each other were keeping secret this new operation of some sort.
NARRATOR:
Dozensof NSA employees were sworn to secrecy, but before long, details were leaked to Drake.
Ihavepeoplecomingtome with grave concerns about,
"What are we doing, Tom?
I thought we're supposed to have a warrant.
I'm being directed to deploy what's normally foreign intelligence, outward-facing equipment, I'm being now directed to place it on internal networks."
NARRATOR:
Atthesametime ,
Bill Binney and the ThinThread team heard that "The Program"
was using ThinThread but stripping out the privacy protections.
Whatthey'rehearingisthat the program they designed is in some form being put into use, but without the protections that they had designed in.
Whattheydidwas theygot rid of the section of the code that encrypted any of the attributes of U.S. citizens.
NARRATOR:
EvenEd Loomis, who had wanted a more robust approach, was surprised at how far the agency was willing to go.
Ijustrefusedtobelieve, after all I had been through for
37 years, that all of a sudden things would change and they'd go back to the old ways, back to the early '70s.
I didn't believe that they could possibly have just flip-flopped and gone 180 degrees the other way.
I just didn't believe it.
NARRATOR:
TotheThinThread team, collecting data without a warrant seemed like a direct violation of the rules they had followed for years.
Alltheseyearshavinggrown up, you never spy on Americans.
We had suddenly become criminals by association.
The agency had gone down a path that we had been preached to you never do.
We were very, very, very concerned.
NARRATOR:
Andthefactthat their ThinThread system had been incorporated into the program was the last straw.
Wesaid,"Wecan 'tstick around and be a party to this.
We can't be an accessory to all these crimes, so we have to get out."
NARRATOR:
Attheend of
October 2001, Bill Binney,
Kirk Wiebe and Ed Loomis all quietly retired.
Tom Drake stayed behind.
SoDrakeis nowstillworking away over at the NSA with his worries rising about what's going on in terms of domestic surveillance.
NARRATOR:
Onceagain,Drake confronted Maureen Baginski.
Imadeonefinalattempt,one final appeal to Maureen Baginski, and she demurred and she simply said, "Call the
Office of General Counsel,"
which I did.
And I said, "I want to speak to the lead attorney."
She'd given me the name.
"I want to speak..."
It was Vito Potenza.
Hegoesto thegeneral counsel's office with his concerns and says, "I think this program may be illegal."
Heproceededto tellme, "You don't understand.
All the lawyers have approved it.
It's legal.
We are under emergency, emergency conditions.
Extraordinary, extraordinary means are required to deal with the threat.
We just need the data."
And then the most chilling...
I don't often have said this part of the conversation:
"Don't ask any more questions, Mr. Drake."
Ifhecametome,someonewho was not read into the program, right, and not a part of what we were doing, and told me that we were running amok, essentially, and violating the
Constitution, and it was in that time frame when there was an awful lot going on and we were all worried about the next attack, there's no doubt in my mind I would have told him, you know, "Go talk to your management.
Don't bother me with this."
I mean, you know, the minute he said, if he did say,
"You're using this to violate the Constitution," I mean,
I probably would have stopped the conversation at that point, quite frankly.
So I mean, if that's what he said he said, then anything after that I probably wasn't listening to anyway.
NARRATOR:" TheProgram" was continuing to grow.
In secret, the nation's largest telephone companies were now giving the NSA the private call records of millions of Americans.
Tom Drake had hit a dead end inside the agency.
That fall, Bill Binney took an extraordinary step.
He decided to break ranks:
to take the matter to Congress.
Thenextmoveistotry to get some cooperation from
Congress, from the Senate and
House Intelligence Committees.
And he finds an ally in Diane
Roark, who felt the same way.
NARRATOR:
DianeRoarkwas a top congressional intelligence staffer.
Iworkedat theHouse
Intelligence Committee for 17 years.
And for the last five of those years, I had the NSA account for the Republican majority.
She'saninteresting character.
She's very conservative.
She's a Republican.
She is in oversight of the NSA partly to make it powerful and also to keep it from wasting money.
NARRATOR:
Porter Goss was Roark's boss.
Goss was the powerful chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence and future CIA director.
Dianeisthego-togirl on the House Permanent Select
Committee on matters dealing with NSA.
So she spent a fair amount of time at NSA.
She knew personnel out there.
NARRATOR:
BinneyandRoark decided it would be safer to meet away from her congressional office.
Billcameto me at my house and told me that part of their system, their ThinThread system, was being used for collection of domestic communications in a dragnet fashion, collection on everybody.
SoDianesays,"Theyhave gone rogue," you know?
That was her point: she thought they were going rogue.
Iwasaghast.
I was absolutely aghast.
Because NSA had... because this constituted a complete reversal of NSA policy.
Roarkisaveryfeistywoman .
She was just certain that there was no way that this program was legal, and she said, "And if the
NSA officials are breaking the law, I am going to fry them."
NARRATOR:
Roarkbeganto distribute a series of searing memos to the leaders of the
House Intelligence Committee.
Dianewasverycapable,so good that she pierced the veil of a program that she was not briefed on, not cleared for, but knew something was going on.
Iupdatedthemonwhat was going on, explained to them the... all the technology in as simple a way as I could.
And I argued very strongly that they needed to have the protections restored.
I told them that if they did not... if the administration refused to do this, they should insist that the system be killed, be stopped.
NARRATOR:
WhatRoarkdid not know was that in October, the
White House had invited a small group of congressional leaders to a secret briefing in the vice president's office.
General Hayden led the briefing.
MikeHaydenis particularly good at coming in and explaining things in a way that, shall we say, neophytes in the business could understand it.
And you really wanted to believe what Mike had to say and absorb it and digest it rather than question it.
Hehasveryfacile command of the facts.
He's also very good at eliding past the parts that he doesn't think you want to hear, and using very careful language to avoid saying things he doesn't want to say while also avoiding any outright falsehood.
Ourpurposein thiswas to get the other political branch involved in this program.
And so we would be defeating our own purposes, working against our own goals, if we weren't full monty to these folks.
NARRATOR:
Butas open as Hayden says he was, he and the vice president's office created strict conditions for the briefing.
Youhavetheindividual senator or member of Congress who is brought in and read into a program.
They're not allowed to bring any staff with them.
They're not necessarily allowed to communicate any of what they've heard to their staff.
In some instances, they're not lawyers, so they may not understand all of the legal fine points.
In most instances, they're not technologists, so they may not be able to grasp what it is precisely that they're being briefed on or the implications of it.
14peoplewerekilled and scores were wounded...
NARRATOR:
Theyreturned to Congress, some now feeling they were unable to exercise effective oversight of the program.
By the summer of 2002, it was running full speed.
AndI arguedwitheverybody that I met, and I got no refutation from them.
I said it was unethical, immoral, politically stupid, illegal and unconstitutional, and stop.
And when this comes out, all hell is going to break loose.
NARRATOR:
Finally, intelligence committee chairman
Porter Goss had had enough.
Isaid,"Youneedtotalk to General Hayden, and you also need to know that concerns of the areas you're talking about are known to me.
And I'm not going to discuss, because you're frankly not cleared for this level of program or what's going on here.
But the fact that you have discovered this means that you need to talk to General Hayden."
NARRATOR:
Roarkwassummoned to the top deck at the NSA to meet with Director Hayden.
Mywholepointingoingthere was to ask him why he had taken off the protections:
the encryption and the automated tracking.
I asked this any number of times, and he always evaded answering.
And I finally just decided I was not going to leave the room until I got an answer.
And so I kept asking.
And so about the fifth time, he looked down, and I remember he could not look me in the eye, and he said, "We have the power.
We don't need them."
And he made clear that the power he was referring to was the commander in chief's wartime authority.
It'sawkwardformehaving the conversation, because she's not been briefed on the program, all right?
So to a certain level of detail,
I simply respond that I disagree with both of her conclusions.
I think what we're doing is lawful, and I think what it is we're doing is effective.
And if I knew of a better way of doing it, I would do that too.
Towardtheendofthe meeting, General Hayden made it pretty clear that he wanted me to stop lobbying against the program.
Isaid,"Look,Diane, this is going to become public.
And when it becomes public, you can argue your point and I can argue mine."
Andsoinsteadofallaying my concerns, this actually made me far more worried.
It was clear to me that he didn't like my talking to other people in the executive branch and on the House Intelligence
Committee and trying to convince them to put controls on the program.
NARRATOR:
Fornow, Hayden's secret was secure.
NARRATOR:
Byearly2003, keeping "the president's program" secret was about to become harder.
Fewanswersso far...
NARRATOR:
Inasmalloffice at the Department of Justice, attorney Thomas Tamm had just started a new job.

But not just any FBI agents.
His uncle was one of the top aides to J. Edgar Hoover.

And it was literally in a bank vault because they were worried about the Soviet Union overhearing what was going on.
Goodevening.
President Nixon reportedly will announce his resignation tonight...
NARRATOR:
TheFISACourthad been set up to act as a watchdog after those revelations during the Nixon administration that the NSA had been spying on Americans.
Whenthatcameout ,you saw a period of reform like none other we'd seen, like nothing we'd seen before then, and frankly, nothing since.
NARRATOR:
Underthereforms, the NSA could conduct surveillance inside the United
States only if the FISA Court issued a warrant.
Youcanturnyourears outward, but not inward.
You can listen all you want abroad, but you really cannot do that to Americans unless you have a warrant.
NARRATOR:
Andinsidethe
Department of Justice, it was
Thomas Tamm's job to prepare warrants for the FISA Court.
Thelawspecificallysaid that if you didn't go through the court, you were committing a federal felony.
NARRATOR:
ButthenasTamm began working on terrorism cases, he discovered something surprising:
evidence of "The Program."
Therearereferencesto wiretaps and information that hadn't come through FISA warrants.
So the question is, "Where did they come from?
Where did the government get this information?"
NARRATOR:
Tammlearnedthat hardly anyone at the DOJ knew details about what was going on.
Iaskedasupervisorofmine if she knew what "The Program"
was about, and she told me that she just assumed that what we were doing was illegal, and she didn't want to ask any questions.
NARRATOR:
Tamm became concerned.
Theywereconducting electronic surveillance without getting warrants, and using that information then to develop probable cause and basically not informing the court of the source of the information.
NARRATOR:
Tammandothersat the DOJ, unaware of the secret presidential order, wondered if
Attorney General Ashcroft was doing something illegal.
Itjustkindofateaway at me and kind of came to a head when I ran into one of the deputies of the unit who said that there was a chance that for the first time ever, that
a sitting attorney general would be indicted.
NARRATOR:
Tammsayshetried to take his questions up the chain of command without success.
Hewasquitedisturbed by that, was quite disturbed that he wasn't getting answers to the questions he was asking.
NARRATOR:
Eventually,Tamm decided to take a risky step.
He headed up Pennsylvania Avenue to Congress for a secret meeting with a powerful senate staffer.
Isaid,"DoesCongressknow what we're doing with regard to this program?"
And she said she couldn't tell me.
And I said, "Well, then I think maybe I will go to the press."
And I remember her last comment was, "You know, Tom, whistleblowers frequently don't end up very well."
And I told her, yeah, I understood that.
InBaghdad,abomblast night set portions...
NARRATOR:
Inthefall of 2003, the White House got involved in filling an important vacancy at the Justice Department.
TheJusticeDepartmentneeds a new head of the Office of
Legal Counsel, which is a very powerful position.
Cheney and Addington get together and say,
"Who should we pick?"
NARRATOR:
DavidAddingtonhad a candidate in mind for the job:
Jack Goldsmith.
JackGoldsmithis impeccably credentialed, a member of the
Federalist Society, well-known and liked in the conservative movement.
David Addington calls Goldsmith in and interrogates him about a few of his lesser known positions and, "What would you think about this or that?"
And he's convinced Goldsmith, like he himself, is a true believer and is going to be making the right decisions.
NARRATOR:
WithAddington's blessing, Goldsmith became the new head of the Office of Legal
Counsel, charged with reviewing the legality of the administration's most secret operations.
Iwasbeingbriefed into a lot of programs:
classified programs, counter-terrorism programs.
I was extraordinarily naive.
I had a sense that this was an important job.
I did not have a full sense of the nature of the issues or the pace.
NARRATOR:
Before long, Goldsmith headed for David Addington's office.
It was time to learn about "The Program."
Jack,likemostoftheothers who are briefed on this, walks into Addington's office, which he regards as a little bit peculiar, "What's this doing in the vice president's lawyer's office?"
Addington opens the safe and pulls it out.
There's the red cover-- it says "Top Secret/
SI/COMET/STELLARWIND,"
the cover name for this program.
NARRATOR:
Ashe readthe document, Goldsmith began to have grave doubts.
Theprogramwasanexampleof the administration going it alone in secret based on inadequate legal reasoning and flawed legal opinions.
NARRATOR:
Goldsmith discovered that as part of the program, the government had been tracking data about the emails of tens of millions of Americans.
Hesaid,"Youcan 'tjustify the email collection.
It is, on its face, a clear violation of the 4th Amendment and perhaps the 1st Amendment as well."
NARRATOR:
Addingtonwas furious that Goldsmith would raise questions about "The
Program," and he let him know.
Hewasverytoughin making his arguments.
He was very sarcastic and aggressive against people with whom he disagreed, and dismissive oftentimes.
And he acted with the implicit blessing of the vice president.
So all of these things made him a very, very forceful presence.
Youknow,Davidpushed, he pushed everybody.
He pushed me.
Even when I was the attorney general, he would push me.
So that was just David's nature, and I think Jack didn't appreciate being pushed sometimes.
HewasdaringJackGoldsmith to say, "This is illegal and you've got to stop it."
He never believed that Goldsmith would do it.
Goldsmithtellshim,
"We're going to pull back our endorsement of the legality of this program."
And Addington roars at him and says, "If you do that, the blood of 100,000 people killed in the next attack will be on your head."
NARRATOR:
ForCheney,
Addington, Gonzales, Hayden and others, the personal stakes at this moment were extremely high.
Itwasafelonytoconduct this kind of surveillance in the United States.
And everyone was relying on the shield that they were trying to create of having the president order it explicitly and have the attorney general sign off and say, "It's lawful."
And as soon as the Justice
Department starts to say, "We're not so sure this is lawful,"
there is a great deal of concern and anxiety.

NARRATOR:
AttheJustice
Department, they prepared for conflict with the White House.
Goldsmith's boss, deputy attorney general James Comey, delivered the news to John
Ashcroft: parts of the program appeared to be illegal.
Theygoto theattorney general, John Ashcroft.
They say, "We don't think this is legal.
We think we need to get this changed.
We need to stop what's going on because we don't have a solid foundation to go on."
NARRATOR:
Ashcroft was supposed to sign a reauthorization of the entire program every 45 days, and for two and a half years, he had.
But now he balked.
AshcroftgivesComeyhis verbal assurance that he is not going to go along with this program and that he is going to demand changes or he won't sign.
NARRATOR:
Thenjusthours later, Attorney General Ashcroft collapsed, suffering from severe pancreatitis.
James Comey was now the acting attorney general.
ComeynotifiestheWhite
House formally that he's not going to sign, and we're now within 48 hours of expiration of this program.
NARRATOR:
Withthedeadline looming inside the White House,
Alberto Gonzales, chief of staff
Andrew Card and David Addington headed to Attorney General
Ashcroft's hospital room.
Wewentto theWestWing , picked up David, who had the authorization.
We get to the hospital and I tell David to stay back because there was history between David and the Attorney General and I didn't want to aggravate the Attorney General needlessly.
JanetAshcroft,theattorney general's wife, is very alarmed.
She calls up Ashcroft's chief of staff and says, "Oh my God, they're coming over."
Ashcroft's chief of staff calls Comey, the deputy.
Comey is in a car on his way home.
He has the driver make an actual U-turn.
They slapped the flasher and the siren on, and he heads over to that hospital as fast as he can go.
Itwastheevening, about 8:00, and I got a call from the Justice Department command center.
So I rushed to the hospital, double parked, ran up the stairs.
NARRATOR:
GoldsmithandComey waited in Ashcroft's room.
Hehadtubesgoing in and out of him.
He looked ashen, and I actually thought he looked near death.
I thought he looked just terrible.
In walked Alberto Gonzales, the
White House counsel, and Andrew
Card, the president's chief of staff.
Wegetto thehospital and General Ashcroft is laying in bed.
And as soon as we got there,
I said nothing other than,
"Sorry you're feeling bad."
And Judge Gonzales said,
"We have brought the document.
Here is the document."
AttorneyGeneralAshcroft kind of lifted himself.
He arose from the bed, lifted himself up and gave about a two- or three-minute speech or talk addressed to Gonzales and Card, in which he basically...
I can't get into the details, but he showed enormous, unbelievable clarity about what the issues were and what was going on.
And he explained why he also would not approve the program.
And he read them a bit of the riot act, and then he said...
At the end of all this, he said,
"In any event, I'm not the attorney general now.
Jim Comey is," because Jim Comey was the acting attorney general.
And with that extraordinary performance-- and it was just amazing, one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my life, because he went from seeming, you know, near death to having this moment, this amazing
moment of clarity-- and he just again receded into the bed, and I really worried at that point that he was going to expire.
And I mean, it just... it looked like he gave it the last of his energy.
Andsofinally,whenhe repeats again he's no longer the attorney general and is finished talking, Andy and I just said,
"Thank you, we'll raise this with the deputy attorney general," and we left.
Itwasan intense, unbelievable scene.
And Gonzales and Card quickly left, and that was the end of it.
NARRATOR:
Inthewakeofthe hospital confrontation, at the
White House, Cheney insisted the president should act on his own:
reauthorize all of the program even though the Justice
Department said part of it was illegal.
CheneyandDavidAddington draft a new order.
And this time, it has one subtle difference.
Instead of having a signature page for the attorney general,
"I certify the lawfulness of this order," there's a new signature for the White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, who does not have the same legal authority.
Isatisfiedmyselfthatthere was sufficient legal authority to move forward.
And I felt that the president was not a lawyer, and that it was my job, if I felt comfortable that it was in fact lawful, to provide that signature.
I did it because I wanted to protect the president.
That's why I signed that document.
NARRATOR:
ButtheWhiteHouse wondered, "Would General Hayden go out on a legal limb and continue the program?"
DavidAddingtoncallsmeand says, "Are you willing to do this without the signature of the attorney general?
With the signature of White
House counsel Al Gonzales and authorization from the president?"
And I thought and I said, "Yes."
NARRATOR:
HaydenandGonzales say their willingness was informed by something that happened just before the Addington call.
(explosions)
InMadridthismorning,more than 190 people were killed...
Afteratleastten simultaneous bomb blasts...
NARRATOR:
Itwasone ofthe worst terrorist attacks since September 11.
Seriesofbombattacksat three train stations during...
Giventhatstarknessofthe al Qaeda threat and given the ambiguity of the situation, I thought the correct operational, legal and ethical decision was,
"All right, we'll do this one more time on a somewhat different framework."
Sothatwasapointwhere he could have said, "I'm turning it off until we get a proper order from the Justice Department."
But he didn't.
He went along with Addington and Cheney.
NARRATOR:
Thatafternoon,
President Bush reauthorized the program.
At the Justice Department, Jack Goldsmith prepared his resignation letter.
Ihaddraftedmyresignation letter and was prepared to resign, and I was sure I was going to resign that day.
It was inconceivable to me, based on what had happened the last two days, that I wouldn't resign.
NARRATOR:
Dozensof topDOJ officials threatened to join him, including FBI Director
Mueller and even Acting Attorney General Comey.
"AndI wouldneverbepart of something that I believe to be fundamentally wrong.
With a heavy heart and undiminished love of my country and my department, I resign as deputy attorney general of the
United States, effective immediately.
Sincerely yours, James B. Comey."
GeorgeBushis on the edge of a cliff.
His presidency is at stake.
This was going to be something on the order of two dozen, nearly the entire political appointment list at the Justice
Department, from the attorney general on down.
And no president could survive that in an election year.
NARRATOR:
Thenextmorning, the president decided to have a private talk with Acting Attorney General Comey.
Afterthenationalsecurity briefing, Bush says to Comey, "Stay a minute.
Come talk to me."
And Cheney starts to follow, and Bush says, "No, no, this is just the two of us."
And he says, "What's going on here?
How could you possibly do something of this importance at the very last minute?"
Comey suddenly realizes that the president had no idea what had been happening.
The president thinks this just began yesterday.
He doesn't know it's been going on for three months.
And so he says, "Mr. President, if that's what you've been told, you have been very poorly served by your advisors."
Thepresidentcertainly did not want a situation where the FBI director and the deputy attorney general would resign, so he was not too happy to learn that this had risen to a level of angst that it had risen to.
NARRATOR:
Thepresidentthen sent for FBI Director Mueller.
Muelleriswaitingdownstairs a level, outside the Situation Room.
Some aide goes and says,
"The president wants to see you right now, get in there."
And Bush says to Mueller,
"Go tell Jim Comey to fix this.
I withdraw the order.
You go make it right."
NARRATOR:
Thewarrantless email data collection was shut down.
The crisis was averted.
But at the White House, they were determined to resume it.
Andsothey'resortof sifting through the FISA law, they're sifting through the
Patriot Act trying to find existing laws, existing authorities, you might call it loopholes, to justify these programs.
NARRATOR:
GeneralHaydenwas sent to the secret FISA Court to convince a judge to restart it.
Couldwegetacourt order to authorize this?
And so we began a very aggressive program with the chief judge of the FISA Court at that time, Judge Kollar-Kotelly, to take that part of the program that had been stopped and present it to her to see if we
could get an order to allow that program to go forward.
Haydenpersonallymeetswith
Judge Kotelly of the FISA Court on two Saturdays to make the pitch, to explain how they are going to do this.
And Kotelly eventually rules that this is legal:
that the NSA can indeed collect all of the Internet metadata going to and from the United States.
And they used this authority that previously was used to trace numbers going to and from a single telephone...
for everybody.
NARRATOR:
Kollar-Kotelly's secret ruling relied on a controversial interpretation of a 25-year-old Supreme Court case.
Thiswas,frankly, a huge stretch.
The idea that you could use this to justify the collection of trillions of pieces of Internet metadata surprised a lot of people when it came out in the Snowden archives.
But that's where they went.
NARRATOR:
Theprogramwas back on line, bigger than ever.
Thatpartof theprogramover which there was a grand dispute in the spring of 2004 was resumed in large measure under a different legal theory by the fall of 2004.
Bushondaytwo ofhistour to defend the Patriot Act, this time in Buffalo, New York...
InBuffalo,he continued his push for an extension of the anti-terror law...
NARRATOR:
Thatsameyear, the president hit the campaign trail, publicly arguing there was no warrantless surveillance program.
Nothinghas changed, by the way.
When we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court order before we do so.
Bushgotup thereseveral times and said, "When you hear about us wiretapping, that means we're getting a court warrant."
Well, we knew that wasn't true.
He was leaving out this whole other side of the equation in terms of the NSA operation.
It'simportantforour fellow citizens to understand, constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our homeland, because we value the Constitution.
Thank you for coming.
NARRATOR:
Asthepresident insisted the government always secured warrants, in Washington, that Department of Justice attorney Thomas Tamm knew otherwise.
Iagonizedfor...
probably for months.
I was upset, I would say, with what I thought was being done to the way our government was supposed to work.
NARRATOR:
Tammhadnot been aware that Jack Goldsmith and the top echelon at the Department of Justice had nearly resigned.
But his concerns about the program had continued to grow.
Heagonizedaboutthis, spent a lot of sleepless nights, wondered about what he should do.
Itjustkindof ate away at me.
It was pretty clear to me, at least, that I didn't want to keep participating in whatever was going on.
NARRATOR:
Tammdecided to take a very big step, one dramatically out of character for the son and nephew of high ranking FBI agents.
One day, on his lunch break, he slipped into a Washington subway station.
He used a pay phone to make an anonymous call to the New York
Times.
Hesaidhe wassweating, nervous, looking around.
He felt, he said, "like a spy"
when he made that phone call.
But he did.
Icertainlywasconsciousof the fact that if I were going to be found out-- and I did think
I would be found out actually, eventually, that there would be serious ramifications-- but
I just thought it was important.
NARRATOR:
Tammsaysthe phone call was to a New York Times reporter.
IhadreadarticlesbyEric
Lichtblau with the New York Times.
I knew he was covering the Department of Justice.
NARRATOR:
Lichtblauwillnot confirm that Tamm was a source, but acknowledges receiving a tip from an anonymous source.
Therewasasuggestionfrom one of the early sources that whatever was going on involving this supersensitive spy program was causing such tumult and debate within the Justice
Department that there's talk of Ashcroft being indicted.
That certainly gets your attention.
NARRATOR:
Tammsays he and Lichtblau had a series of clandestine conversations around Washington.
Ieventuallytoldhim my suspicions that a very, very limited people knew what it was all about and that really some very experienced, high level lawyers thought what the government was doing was illegal.
NARRATOR:
Havingleaked,
Tamm disappeared back into the bureaucracy at the Justice Department.
At the Times, Eric Lichtblau knew that another reporter,
James Risen, had also been hearing about "The Program."
Weheard,basically,thatthe president had authorized a warrantless wiretapping program.
It was believed by the people we were talking to to be in violation of FISA and of the Constitution.
Theyweredoingthingswell outside their lane, without the knowledge of most of the court, without the knowledge of most members of Congress, really, on the White House's own authority.
That was really what, in our mind, made the story.
NARRATOR:
Eagerto get
General Hayden on the record,
James Risen called the NSA.
Itoldthepresspersonthat
I needed to talk to Hayden immediately, and for a very sensitive matter.
And I didn't tell them exactly what it was.
But to my surprise, she got him on the phone immediately.
Iremember,Iwas sitting next to him and I did not know he was going to do that.
It was a bit shocking, not only that he was calling him, but also that he got Hayden on the line.
Ireadhim,like, two paragraphs of the draft of the story.
"MonthsaftertheSeptember 11 attacks, President Bush secretly authorized the National
Security Agency to eavesdrop on
Americans and others..."
Andyoucouldhear,like ,a sharp intake of breath, like...
(gasps)
You know, it was almost like he was...
He didn't want to say it, but he was like, "I can't believe you got that story."
Ithinkthisis a very bad thing.
There is a reason we keep intelligence sources and methods secret.
It's the same reason journalists try to keep their sources and methods secret.
You know, you can't survive unless you keep them secret.
I'dcaughthimoff guard,and he had started to confirm it, and then realized what he was doing, and hung up.
NARRATOR:
Haydensounded the alarm: the New York Times was preparing to expose the existence of "The Program" in the middle of an election year.
Wewereworriedthatthis would compromise a very important, very significant intelligence activity.
There was a debate within the administration about what to do, should we try to get an injunction.
NARRATOR:
TheWhiteHouse demanded a series of meetings with the Times.
The first was inside the
Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
Acting CIA Director John
McLaughlin ran the meeting.
OnethingIrememberabout his presentation was that he never actually confirmed that they had such a program.
Theykepttalkinginthese hypotheticals, like saying,
"If we were doing this, this would be very important to the government."
Thelanguagehe used,which was kind of Orwellian in a way, was, "If the United States had such a program, we would request that the New York Times not publish any information about it."
AndthenIstartedtaking notes and they tried to stop me from taking notes.
It was a very contentious meeting that only convinced me further that the story was right and that they were trying to stop it.
NARRATOR:
Inmeetingafter meeting, the government made the argument "The Program" was both effective and legal.
Oneofthestrongestselling points that they made, which to my mind was probably the most disingenuous, was the idea that this had all been legally reviewed, this was all perfectly legal, perfectly constitutional, everyone was on board.
There was no doubt about its legality.
NARRATOR:
Backin theTimes offices, the reporters argued the White House was misleading them.
But the editors were not convinced the story should run.
Therewereintense discussions, and it got emotional on all sides.
Wearguedthatthiswas really important, that our sources were telling us it was illegal or unconstitutional, that there was clearly people in the government who disagreed with what the government, what the officials were saying to the editors.
NARRATOR:
Inthefallof 2004, the administration invited the Times' top editors to a closed door meeting.
Executive Editor Bill Keller met with the president's top advisors:
Condoleezza Rice,
General Hayden, Alberto Gonzales and others, who insisted to
Keller that revealing the existence of the program would endanger national security.
Ihadaconsensusof everybody that we had contact with in the administration that this would be an extremely dangerous thing to do.
These were serious people, a consensus across the board of those who talked to us that it was going to be dangerous, a level of stridency that was quite impressive.
And after much discussion, decided that we weren't ready to go with it.
NARRATOR:
Keller spiked the story.
The White House had prevailed.
The program would remain a well-kept secret.
Thepresidenthasordered a major shake-up of America's spy operations...
The nuts and bolts of intelligence will fall to
Lieutenant General Michael
Hayden, who now heads up the once super secret...
NARRATOR:
GeneralHaydenwas promoted by the White House to help oversee all intelligence operations.
He was replaced by a new general:
Keith Alexander.
The change gave Tom Drake another chance to voice his concerns about "The Program."
He wrote General Alexander a classified letter.
Withinthesystem,mylast official act for all intents and purposes was to write that formal letter to Alexander.
NARRATOR:
Thelettersaidthe
NSA's intelligence gathering activities were out of control and needed to be reined in.
Thisisacrusadeforhim.
Being Drake, someone who's got a somewhat obsessive personality, he keeps trying to get the word out.
NARRATOR:
ButGeneral
Alexander was no more responsive than Hayden had been, and by writing directly to the general,
Drake had broken bureaucratic protocol.
His days were numbered.
Theyactuallyreorganized my job right out from under me, and I literally was left with nothing.
I had an office, I had a flag because of senior executive, but nothing else.
No programs, no people, no team, no nothing.
NARRATOR:
Drakehadformed friendships with the ThinThread group:
Binney, Wiebe, Loomis and Congress's Diane Roark.
Now they began to seriously consider what they called "The Nuclear Option":
going to the press.
AndI canrememberthrowing the question out there one evening.
I said, "What do we do?
Tom's not getting anywhere."
And so we would say,
"Is it time to go to the press?
Invoke the nuclear option, which is going to the press?"
And we were all afraid to do it.
Wewerestilltraditional kind of employees of the government and wanted to stay inside the government to try to get the government to change its ways, to right itself as opposed to having to force it by going to the fourth estate, the public.
Thethirdrailoptionof going to the press was fraught with enormous peril.
At a minimum, you would no doubt be fired, or worse.
NARRATOR:
Ithadbeennearly one year since the New York
Times had refused to publish the investigation into the NSA.
During that year, "The Program"
had grown dramatically.
Terabytes-- huge amounts of information about Americans' telephone calls and emails-- had been clandestinely captured.
Finally, reporter James Risen from the New York Times had had enough.
He decided to strike out on his own.
Thestorywasdeadnow, twice dead, and I thought the only way to ever get this story out was to put it in a book.
NARRATOR:
Risenhada surprise for Eric Lichtblau.
He invited him to drive over to his house to read a draft chapter of the book:
the story the New York Times had refused to print.
Thechapterwasjust called "The Program."
And in it, he basically made known the existence of this program and the fact that the administration had gotten the paper to spike the story.
Isaid,"I wanttomake sure it's okay with you."
He said, "The only thing I ask is that you put my name in there, too."
NARRATOR:
Itdidnot take long for the editors at the
New York Times to get word of what Risen was planning.
Ibeganto hearthroughthe grapevine that he might include the NSA story in the book.
So that led to a series of, you know, very awkward conversations with Jim.
Theeditorswere furious at me.
They thought I was being insubordinate.
Hehadagun totheirhead.
They're really being forced to reconsider.
The paper's gonna look pretty bad.
Thatledto thismassivegame of chicken between me, my book and the New York Times over the next few months.
NARRATOR:
InsidetheTimes, the editor who had killed the story 12 months earlier now faced a hard choice.
Becausewehadtoeither decide, "We're still not ready to run the story," or, "The situation has changed sufficiently that we are ready to run the story," in which case we'd better get the story in the
best possible shape and let the administration know.
NARRATOR:
Onafrigid
December evening, editors Bill
Keller, Phil Taubman and New York Times publisher
Arthur Sulzberger were summoned to the White House.
Itwasindeeda dark and stormy night.
I remember it.
It was dark and it was stormy.
And we were in the Oval.
Mr. Sulzberger began to speak and the president said, "I'm going to go first.
I want to talk to you about this program.
I want to talk to you about why this is important, why we think it saves lives, and why it should not be made public."
NARRATOR:
Thepresident turned the meeting over to
General Hayden for one of his famous briefings.
It'shardto brief in the Oval.
You know, you can't...
no visual aids.
Hard to roll out something in front of somebody.
So I gave them the best explanation of the program
I could, but I did bring up specific examples.
Theexamplehe givesthemis a plot in which a radical was planning to bring down the
Brooklyn Bridge, apparently with a device similar to a blowtorch.
And it actually kind of makes the Times editors kind of scratch their heads, because they think this is kind of surprising, that somebody can sit there with a blowtorch or something like that and bring down the Brooklyn
Bridge without anybody noticing him and stopping him first seemed absurd to them.
IthinkArthurbelievesthat the president may have cracked a smile when the "Bringing Down the Brooklyn Bridge" item came up, but maybe that's just a wishful memory.
NARRATOR:
Thepresidentthen played his trump card, threatening that the New York
Times would be responsible for the next attack.
Hesaid,youknow,"Listen, if you guys publish this article and there is another 9/11, we're going to be called before Congress to explain how we failed to prevent it, and you
should be in the chair beside us explaining, because you'll be complicit in allowing damage to our country."
He was saying, in effect, "You,
Arthur Sulzberger, will have blood on your hands if there's another attack that could've been prevented by this program."
I think anybody would feel goosebumps.
TheNewYorkTimesbrokethe story about the National Security Agency...
NARRATOR:
Nevertheless, the Times decided to publish the story, revealing the existence of "The Program."
Fouryearsnow, the NSA has been secretly spying on its own citizens...
TheNewYorkTimesstory in December 2005 just shocked the world.
Uncheckeddomestic surveillance is far greater than previously reported...
Itisthedefinitioninmost people's minds of illegal government activity.
Witha bombshellof astory in the New York Times today that the NSA...
NARRATOR:
They were in crisis mode at the White House.
All eyes were on President Bush.
Wecallit the big pause, okay?
When stuff like this goes public, what's the big guy going to do?
Is he going to man up and support you, or suddenly get reflective on you?
Andforonce,the president actually decides he's going to come out and address it directly.
He goes on the offensive to try to push back against critics who said he went too far.
NARRATOR:
Itwouldbe a first: an admission the program existed.
Thisisahighlyclassified program that is crucial to our national security.
Its purpose is to detect and prevent terrorist attacks against the United States, our friends and allies.
Thepresidentcomesout and minimizes what he describes as "The Program."
And he gives a very truncated description of what they're doing that sounds, I think, probably not too worrisome to most Americans.
IauthorizedtheNational
Security Agency, consistent with
U.S. law and the Constitution, to intercept the international communications of people with known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations.
NARRATOR:
Itwasthe least controversial and smallest element of the program.
There was no reference to the massive gathering of domestic communications data.
Hischaracterization of the facts was simply wrong.
And it was wrong from the beginning.
The program wasn't to surveil known suspects, known conspirators.
You could easily get a warrant for that.
The program was to sift big data.
It was to trawl through enormous volumes, literally trillions of telephone calls, trillions of emails, and to look for unknown conspirators.
NARRATOR:
Onceagain,it would be left to General Hayden to brief the press.
He too minimized the scale of "The Program."
Thisistargeted.
This is focused.
This is about al Qaeda.
One end of any call targeted under this program is always outside the United States.
Whentheyaskedquestions about how widespread the program was, he confined it to this little part of the program that had leaked and did not address all the other parts that were far worse that had not leaked.
NARRATOR:
Therewasno mention that the NSA was tracking telephone calls and emails inside the United States.
And Hayden even dismissed the idea that there had been any internal dissent about "The Program."
Nota singleemployeeofthe
National Security Agency has addressed a concern about this program to the NSA IG.
I should also add that no member of the NSA workforce who has been asked to be included in this program has responded to that request with anything except enthusiasm.
GeneralHayden'spress conference introduced many of the tactics that the administration has used to deflect questioning and also to mislead the public.
I was amazed at what he was saying, because it was not truthful; it was misleading.
And that was the beginning of the spinning and the lies.

NARRATOR:
AttheNational
Security Agency, Thomas Drake was watching the White House's reaction carefully.
Drakewatcheswhattop levels of the U.S. government's saying about this program, and he thinks they're lying.
Irealizedthattheywere lying, that they were desperate to protect the domestic surveillance program.
Heknowsit 'smuchmorethan what they're describing, and this makes him mad.
Thefarlargerprogramwas the dragnet surveillance, the vast bulk copy of millions and millions of phone records, email records, Internet usage, and financial transactional and credit card information.
NARRATOR:
Drakehadbeen complaining internally about the program for more than four years.
Now he said he had run out of options.
Alltheinternalproper channels had been exhausted.
The one final choice was to actually touch the third rail and go to the press.
NARRATOR:
Drakedecidedto act on his own, without the ThinThread team.
He'd reach out to a newspaper reporter.
Siobhan Gorman worked for the Baltimore Sun.
Hejustreachesout toherin a way that he thinks is secret, using all kinds of protected
Hushmail to tell her he wants to talk to her and might have documents to share with her.
NARRATOR:
Drakesaidthathe would only provide unclassified material.
It'sa prettyclassic whistleblower kind of move that he makes, and he's careful, he thinks, not to violate any kind of national security laws in reaching out to her.
NARRATOR:
Gormanwillnot acknowledge that Drake was her source, but she says she knows why she received the leaks.
Therewereanumberofpeople at NSA that were just very unhappy, and I think that the revelation of warrantless surveillance probably did loosen up some concerns that some people inside NSA might have had.
NARRATOR:
Atfirst,Drake remained completely anonymous, communicating entirely by encrypted email.
Shehadno ideawho Iwas.
I ultimately was referred to as just a senior official.
It was sort of an agreement as to how she would "couch"
who I was in her reporting.
But I was a deep...
I was a deep source.
TheBaltimoreSunreports today that the NSA rejected...
AndsoIprovidedher unclassified information about the secret surveillance program.
NARRATOR:
Gormanwouldwrite a series of lengthy stories: a deep investigation into the NSA,
ThinThread, and the warrantless surveillance of millions of Americans.
But Drake wasn't the only leaker.
Other stories broke.
Highrankingofficers in the Justice Department...

House, Vice President Cheney was furious.
He was determined to stop the leakers.
Ifyou'veknownDickCheney--
I've known him for a long time-- he was always upset about leakers, so it wasn't... this was not out of character.
It fit within the character that he was, whether he was secretary of defense or chief of staff to the president.
NARRATOR:
Theinvestigation would be run by the FBI: a massive manhunt for the leakers led by the new attorney general, Alberto Gonzales
Theyhadbroketheylaw.
They leaked classified information.
That's against the law.
The job of the Department of Justice is to prosecute those who break the law.

Justice itself, calling everyone who had worked with the FISA
Court, including Thomas Tamm.
Andhestartsgettingphone calls from this FBI agent, Jason Lawless, at work.
He's ducking the calls.
NARRATOR:
Terrified,Tamm refused to return the calls.
Iwaspreoccupiedwithwhat was going to happen to me and when it was going to happen, what was going to happen, if it was going to happen.
Andfinally,Lawlessgetshim on the phone and says,
"Hey, this'll only take a few minutes."
NARRATOR:
ButTammpanicked and quickly sealed his fate.
ItoldhimthatIchose not to talk to him.
I chose to exercise my rights under the Constitution to not be a witness against myself.
And of course, I knew that immediately would send up red flags and that I would immediately be their primary suspect.
NARRATOR:
ThomasTamm resigned from the Justice Department.
He began to wait for a federal indictment.

NARRATOR:
InCambridge,
Massachusetts, Jack Goldsmith had settled in as a professor at Harvard Law School.
One morning, he was summoned to a meeting in Harvard Square with two FBI agents.
Asweweresittingdown at the table over coffee, one of the agents sort of sheepishly handed me a manila envelope.
And he said that it was a subpoena for a grand jury investigation into the leak of the New York Times.
And he was very embarrassed and sheepish about this.
NARRATOR:
Thesubpoenawas issued under the leadership of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
Anditseemedparticularly ironic that the Justice
Department was coming after me for illegal actions, or allegedly illegal actions or possibly illegal actions, taken in connection with this program.
NARRATOR:
Bythesummerof 2007, it had been more than 18 months since the FBI had begun its investigation.
They had little to show for it.
They decided to up the ante.
They would conduct a series of early morning raids on the houses of their primary suspects.
At9 :00EasternStandard
Time, the FBI, with guns drawn, raids the homes of Binney and
Wiebe, and out on the West
Coast, they raid the home of
Diane Roark, waking her up.
Itwasquiteshocking.
In fact, they went through the whole house and went through every book, every paper, every drawer.
Turned the mattress over.
It was quite shocking.
It's9 :00inthemorning, and I see these blue uniform with gold "FBI" on the back, people coming across left to right, and I said...
Well, it sent a chill through me immediately.
ThefirstIknewtheFBIwas in my house was a guy pointing a gun at me when I was coming out of the shower.
They took my computer, all the electronic hardware, discs and things that go with that, any kind of electronic storage device, and they also took some of my magazines, technical magazines, and papers and things like that.
NARRATOR:
Andthentheyhit one more:
Ed Loomis.
Mylifewasin shambles at that point.
My wife was hysterical.
She couldn't believe what had just occurred.
I couldn't believe what just occurred.
And I had no insight into why it had.
Youknow,thisbuttonis
NSA's second highest award, and
I wonder what it was that I did personally so wrong that I deserve this kind of treatment.
HereI am,an EagleScout, a retired scoutmaster and a devout patriot, and my patriotism is being questioned by the government that I had served for 43 years.
I just couldn't... it just didn't make sense to me.
Youfeelprettylow ,your self-esteem takes a big hit, there is discord in the family because kids, family, wife may ask you, "Well, what did you do to bring this upon the house?"
Ittoreme up .
I was...
I became a recluse, pretty much.
I cut off virtually all social contact with friends.
It was rough.
Very rough.
Edprobablytookitworse in terms of cost to family and self, physically, mentally, because Ed went into the shadows.
He became a recluse, quiet.
He lost his wife.
It'sstilleatingatme.
But I've...
I've told my family.
I've told my...
I told my father before he passed away.
Uh...
I know I've done nothing wrong.
NARRATOR:
TheFBIconsidered them "persons of interest" for leaking to the New York Times, but they all insisted they hadn't, and New York Times reporter James Risen agrees.
Ididn'tknowany ofthem .
And I just felt badly that they were getting caught up in something that was completely unrelated.
I knew that couldn't be true, that it was just collateral damage.
NARRATOR:
TomDrake'shome was not raided by the FBI that day, but Drake had the feeling that he was next.
Almostsixmonthsgoesbyand
Drake still hasn't been raided.
But then on the morning of November 28, 2007...
I'mseeingthesecarspull up as I look out the window.
It's just after 7:00 a.m.
in the morning and there's a dozen FBI agents.
And my heart's up in my throat, because I realize it's now me.
NARRATOR:
TheFBI'ssearch warrant said they were looking for evidence that Drake was the
New York Times leaker.
DrakebeingDrakesitsdown at his kitchen table with the
FBI agents without a lawyer present and spends the entire day trying to convince them that the real culprits are the people at the NSA who have run this illegal program.
SoI toldthemeverything
I could, but they didn't want to hear about that.
They wanted to hear about the
New York Times and sources.
NARRATOR:
TheFBIcartedaway
Drake's computers and boxes of his papers.
Drake waited.
Afewmonthslater,inApril 2008, Drake gets a summons to go meet with somebody who is described as "somebody very important."
NARRATOR:
Themeetingwas with federal prosecutor Steven Tyrrell.
WhenDrakesitsdown, Tyrrell says to him,
"Mr. Drake, you are screwed."
NARRATOR:
Tyrrellhadnohard evidence Drake ever spoke to the
New York Times or that he had given any classified material to The Baltimore Sun.
Nevertheless, Tyrrell said the
FBI had discovered classified documents on Drake's computer and in his basement: a felony.
Heproceededto tellme,
"How would you like to spend the rest of your life in prison, Mr. Drake?
Unless you cooperate with our investigation, we have more than enough information to put you away for a long, long time.
You better start talking."
Andtheytalkednumbers:
478 months-- 35 years.
The government said he would have the blood of soldiers on his hands for what he did.
NARRATOR:
Tyrrellwanted
Drake to confess and admit that he was the center of a conspiracy involving Roark, Binney and the others.
Iwasnotgoingtoplead out.
And he was all ticked off and he says, "Well, we'll just have to go with what we've got."
NARRATOR:
Drakeandthe others faced decades in federal prison and at least tens of thousands of dollars in legal bills.
Desperate, they came to believe they had only one chance.
(crowd cheering)
As it happened, 2008 was a presidential election year, and there was one candidate who was promising a change.
Areyoufiredup?
Ready to go?
Fired up!
Ready to go!
No more secrecy.
That is a commitment I make to you as president.
Heispromisingtobethe most transparent administration in history.
He believes that there's been too much secrecy.
Hemadearealpointof owning these kinds of arguments, both as a senator and then on the campaign trail.
It'stimeforus to change America.
And that's why I'm running for president of the United States.
NARRATOR:
BarackObama even embraced the importance of whistleblowers.
Obama,throughouthis history, is a champion of whistleblowers, arguing that they're the folks who help make government better and reveal conduct that, if not is illegal, is questionable.
Icertainlyhadalotofhope and I had a lot of hope for hope and change.
But I actually thought that somebody might say, "You know, you actually did the right thing."
NARRATOR:
Andwhenit came to the secrecy surrounding the creation of "The Program,"
Obama was forceful.
Iwillprovideour intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom.
That means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens.
It'snota calibrated statement.
This is a political statement.
This is, in his words, a surveillance state run amok.
Nomoreignoringthe law when it is inconvenient.
That is not who we are.
That's not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists.
Itwaslikehewasback at the University of Chicago as a constitutional scholar.
He sounded like an ACLU lawyer.
NARRATOR:
AttheWhiteHouse, in the waning months of the Bush administration, they were determined to find a way to make
"The Program" permanent.
Thedebateshiftedpretty quickly to Congress in terms of debating whether or not the
Administration should get the power to do what they were doing.
NARRATOR:
Thepresident decided to try to convince
Congress to enshrine the program into law.
ForPresidentBush,it's really a significant reversal.
He's decided he needs Congress to back up what he's done.
He, in effect, is abandoning his claim that he has the power under Article Two of the
Constitution to do this without Congress.
NARRATOR:
Theadministration proposed to amend the FISA law and insisted it was "reform,"
but insiders knew it granted the NSA unprecedented power.
TheFISAAmendmentAct of 2008 actually allows some of the things we were doing under the president's authority only against al Qaeda, it allows them for all legitimate foreign intelligence purposes.
So in a sense, the FISA
Amendment Act not only validates the terrorist surveillance program, it expands it.
NARRATOR:
AttheUnited States Congress, the administration secretly made the case for the bill at closed hearings of the intelligence committees.
Youhadto readitvery , very closely to understand what they were doing, and I don't think people knew what actually the intent of that was.
The intent of that was to make legal all of the programs that the attorney general, the FBI director had said they had a problem with.
NARRATOR:
Publicly,the president would press lawmakers with a familiar warning: pass this law or Americans could die.
Withoutthislaw,our ability to prevent new attacks will be weakened.
And it will become harder for us to uncover terrorist plots.
We must not allow this to happen.
NARRATOR:
CandidateBarack
Obama now faced a choice:
would he vote against the president's bill?
Irememberwhenthe bill came forward, there was some discussion as to whether or not he would support it.
TheSenateis expectedto vote on a controversial measure to amend...
Hewasthinkingaheadtothe general election, and how he was a young senator with not a lot of national security experience and how he needed to be seen as being tough on these issues.
NARRATOR:
Inprivate, a tougher, more determined Obama was emerging.
Irememberthefirst conversation I ever had with him during the campaign.
I said, "Look, when you become president, you have to kill people.
Are you willing to pull the trigger?
Are you willing to do that side of the job?"
And he got very silent and looked at me in a very steely kind of way and said,
"I know that and I can do that."
U.S.Senatereturningfinal vote on the FISA bill, setting new rules for electronic surveillance on foreign...
NARRATOR:
Andnow,Obamahad a chance to enhance his national security credentials.
Givesthegovernmentnew powers to eavesdrop on both domestic and international communications...
Forallof hiscriticism in the past, for all of his background as a constitutional lawyer and civil libertarian, he chooses to accept the rather expansive law.
And he votes for it.
Mr.Obama,"Aye."

SenatorBarackObamavoted for the surveillance bill, despite his opposition to it in the past...
It'soffto work for President Obama.
It's a busy first day.
Hetakesovertwo wars, a staggering economy...
NARRATOR:
Sixmonthslater,
Barack Obama was the new president and the commander in chief.
He'stakingon national security right from the start...
Meetingwiththejointchiefs of staff and other military advisors...
ThefirsttimethatBarack
Obama ever learns about the full scale of this program is an early briefing in the Situation
Room about all of the data that the NSA is collecting in these domestic surveillance programs.
Thepointof thebriefingwas to provide the president and the new national security team at the White House with an overview of how these programs worked, what the value of the programs was, the legal structures that
supported the program, what the authority was.
NARRATOR:
Hewastoldabout the trillions of phone calls, emails and Internet data that had been secretly gathered.
Aswetalkedaboutthese programs, the way they were used, in particular the value of the collection of content, an extraordinarily vital tool, that the idea was, "All right, this is a really important program.
We need to maintain it."
NARRATOR:
Thepresident's closest advisors insisted the program was necessary.
Therewasaverystrongview in the intelligence community that this was an important program, that it did fill an important gap.
NARRATOR:
Thenew president faced a decision:
whether to dramatically restrict "The Program."
Ithinkthatthe president approached this with the degree of seriousness that you would hope and expect from the president of the United States.
Whenyougetintooffice, when you're the man, when you're in the White House, you don't want to give up any tools that you inherit.
You don't want to give up anything that might get you that one fact that will stop an attack.
NARRATOR:
Hemadehis decision: the program would continue.
Hehadachanceto say, "That's too far.
Let's not sweep in quite so many people who don't have anything to do with terrorism as part of this broad sweep."
And he chose to keep the programs largely intact.
I'mnotawareofanycase in which Obama pushed back hard and said, "You can't do that."
NARRATOR:
Convincedthe program was effective and necessary, Obama would now own it.
At the NSA, they were now spending more than $10 billion a year on capturing communications of people around the world.
TheNSAwasontheverge of what it came to call the "Golden
Age" of electronic surveillance, because there was so much more communication, so much more data, so much better computer capacity to process it, and it was there for the taking.
NARRATOR:
Torunthe operations, the NSA relied on a number of private contractors:
companies that could provide highly skilled computer programmers and engineers.
TheNSA,CIAand other intelligence services suddenly realized that they needed people with those kind of skills.
NARRATOR:25-year-old
Edward Snowden was one of them.
A high school dropout, Snowden had grown up just 20 minutes from the NSA.
Hegrewup in thecommunity where lots of people who were in the military and the intelligence community live.
His father was in the Coast Guard for 30 years.
Ifyou'vebeentoa RonPaul rally, you've seen lots of people who look exactly like
Edward Snowden: young, clean cut, student, you know...
Passionate about the Constitution.
NARRATOR:
Snowdenhad enlisted in the Army, but left after breaking both of his legs in training.
Hehadthereactionafter 9/11 that a lot of patriotic young Americans had, which is,
"I'd like to do my part."
And that brought him to the NSA and the CIA and the worlds of secret intelligence.
NARRATOR:
By2009,Snowden was working as an NSA contractor in Japan.
The job provided him extensive access to the details of NSA operations.
Hereallybegantounderstand the true scope of how much the
NSA had gotten its hands into the backbone of the Internet.
NARRATOR:
ThemoreSnowden saw, the more disturbed he became.
Itwasagradualaccumulation of evidence and of observations that led him to think,
"Something's going wrong here.
The balance is out of whack.
The surveillance of ordinary people is far greater than
I would have imagined and far greater than the American public has been able to debate."
NARRATOR:
Oneof thekey documents Snowden discovered:
a classified inspector general report detailing the history of "The Program."
Ittellstheentiresecret history of the program.
It talks about Addington and
Hayden writing the authorization for the program.
"AccordingtoGeneralHayden, the vice president's counsel,
David Addington, drafted the first authorization..."
Ittalksaboutthe rebellion at the Justice Department.
"Consequently,theWhite
House counsel rather than the attorney general signed the 11
March 2004 authorization."
It'stheentireunadulterated history of these programs.
Hetoldme thatreadingthe inspector general's report made a big impression on him.
He felt like people had done things that were wrong and had not been held accountable for them.
Thelawsthatare written will be more open to the public.
No more secrecy...
NARRATOR:
AndunderPresident
Obama, Snowden watched as "The Program" continued.
HishopewasthatObamawould be a force for transparency, and that's not what happened.
And that was another of the pivotal moments in which Snowden realized it was going to have to be him.
NARRATOR:
AsSnowdenwas deciding exactly what to do,
Obama's Justice Department began to address those Bush-era leak investigations, led by Attorney
General Eric Holder.
What'sinterestingis that these cases from the Bush era linger on.
They don't just throw them out;
they revisit them.
And they keep going after the enemies of the National Security
Agency, much as they'd done under Bush.
NARRATOR:
Despitethe campaign rhetoric in support of whistleblowers, President Obama did nothing to stop the prosecutions.
Thispresidentpersonally really doesn't like people leaking classified information.
He takes that very seriously and he thinks that we should all take it very seriously.
Ineveryconversationthat
Obama had that I have heard about, he said, "When it comes to national security, you leak classified information that could endanger people, we're going to come down on you like a ton of bricks."
NARRATOR:
Andwhenthe bricks fell, they landed on Thomas Drake.
Theycouldn'tindictusall, so they went after the one that they could at least show an example to the rest of the intelligence analysts,
"You speak, you go to the press, you're going to get hammered."
These were the lessons that were supposed to come out of being raided, and then in Tom's case, indicted.
NARRATOR:
OnApril14, 2010,
Thomas Drake was finally charged.
Iwasarraigned.
Before I was arraigned before the judge, I was fingerprinted by the U.S. marshals with the FBI agent watching.
I was a direct threat to the national security of the United States.
I truly had become an enemy of the state.
NARRATOR:
Drakewascharged with violating the Espionage Act.
AndI 'mfacingthedistinct prospect of having the rest of my left spent behind bars, effectively.
NARRATOR:
Ashe waited for his day in court, Drake's life began to fall apart.
Hespenttwoyearsdraining all his resources on a private attorney, and then when he had no more money, he had to go to a public defender.
Itwas extraordinarily lonely.
I mean, life had become already extremely difficult.
All the income I had, all the retirement's gone, your life is turned upside down.
You're persona non grata.
I ended up finding work, initially part-time, then full-time, at an Apple Store.
NARRATOR:
Atthecenter of the government's case were those documents found at Drake's house.
Prosecutors insisted they were classified.
Drake's lawyers turned to author James Bamford.
Iwashiredasa consultant by the defense and was able to find basically all of the information that they were charging him with was already in the public domain.
Not only that, it had been placed in the public domain by the government itself.
Ilookedat thestuff that he was indicted for.
That material was clearly marked unclassified.
Itwasnotstamped
"Classified" until after it was seized from Tom Drake's home.
Andalltheydid was draw a line through it and classified that material, and so then they charged him with having classified material.
It's like framing him, and we're going to frame you after the fact.
NARRATOR:
Thegovernment later insisted the documents
Drake had contained national secrets and were covered by the Espionage Law.
But then just days before the trial was to begin, the charges against Drake were dropped.
Itwasastounding.
Basically, Drake went from someone charged with such serious crimes that he could spend the rest of his life in prison to having it bargained down, because the Justice
Department could see it was falling apart, to a misdemeanor, where he spent no time at all in prison.
NARRATOR:
Drakeagreedto plead guilty to misdemeanor unauthorized use of a government computer.
He was charged a $25 court fee, put on probation for a year and given community service.
None of the other suspects in the leak investigation were ever charged.
It had been more than ten years.
Despite the revelations of insiders like Drake and the news reports about the program, there was little public outrage and few congressional critics.
"The Program" was continuing to grow.
But at a secret bunker in Hawaii, Edward Snowden was now working for a new NSA contractor.
Snowden was initiating his own move to expose the program.
TheFBIhasraidedthe offices established to protect federal whistleblowers...
NARRATOR:
Snowdenstudied carefully the actions of the other whistleblowers:
the ThinThread group and Tamm, and especially Drake.
WhathelearnedfromDrake and Binney is that you can be discredited or people won't know whether to believe you if you don't have proof.
And it was because of that that he decided it had to be documents, and it had to be a lot of documents.
TheNewYorkTimesbrokethe story after holding it for a year...
NARRATOR:
Andunlike Tamm, Snowden would not go to the New York Times.
Paperfacesquestionsabout why it held that story...
Snowdenwasdisgusted at the New York Times for having that story before the election, sitting on it for month after month.
And he had a real antipathy towards the New York Times as a result of the way they behaved over Risen.
Instead of the New York Times
Snowden would reach out to
Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Barton Gellman.
NARRATOR:
Andhe wouldbegin systematically copying and giving them documents that held many of the United States' most closely guarded secrets.
Snowdenhadclearances for human intelligence.
He had clearances for many, many compartments of electronic surveillance.
And he had a third set of powers, which is actually called "super user."
It was a very potent combination that opened many, many doors to him.
Hereisthislow-level analyst who was able to access, if you believe the government,
1.7 million documents, and walk out of the agency with them without them having the slightest idea that it was taking place.
Thiswasastupendous intelligence breach.
This was the largest collection of classified information, the largest leak of classified information that had ever occurred in the history of the United States, or indeed the history of the world.
EmbarrassingfortheObama administration, in a trove of documents leaked by Edward Snowden...

I'm here to win the heart of Ariadne.
Am I too ambitious?
I'm not sure a prince can ever be too ambitious.
You were lucky.
It won't always be that way.
I would be honoured to accept your proposal.

(SPEAKING IN ANCIENT GREEK)
PASIPHAE:
The wedding date is set?
TELEMON:
We leave for Aegina in two days.
News of the emissary Ariadne dispatched?
It would seem the road to Aegina is fraught with danger, as our young Queen is about to find out.
I will persuade them towards Phyria.
Give us the best chance of success.
And the Queen suspects nothing?
She knows I was estranged from my father.
Not that we never reconciled.
- You have done well.
- Indeed.
Now you must ensure that it was not in vain.
You doubt me?
And when Ariadne is dead?
Do not worry.
You will have your place in my court.
I wish I had your faith in him.
Do not fear.
Telemon is an exile in search of a home.
He will do anything to belong again.
Even kill a queen?
Even that.
Ripped By mstoll
- You've done well.
- There is more.
Well, go on then.
Oh, you've bled me dry.
(COINS (LINKING)
(SIGHS)
Give me the benefit of your wisdom.
What else have you learnt?
He sleeps with one eye open.
What use is that to me?
Come back here!
I'll tan your hide!
You were right.
Prince Telemon's been out of the city.
All night.
Doing what?
I cannot say.
I made this journey but a week ago.
It would be foolish to enter into King Agenor's territory.
King Agenor has always thought highly of Atlantis.
Well, what of his relationship with my father?
I know nothing of this.
I would prefer not to make this journey at all.
What are you suggesting?
The Queen remains in Atlantis.
Then there can be no wedding.
I must have my father's blessing.
After everything that has gone between us, it is of the utmost importance to me.
We travel to Aegina.
As you wish.
Might I make a suggestion?
We go by way of Phyria.
The Colcheans will not have patrols in the desert.
I will give it some consideration, but I alone will know the chosen route.
It is as I've asked.
Of course.
As you wish.
JASON:
I cannot let her travel to Aegina unaware of the potential danger.
Jason, you cannot burst in there with wild accusations.
Whatever else Telemon is, he is a prince.
- And Ariadne's betrothed.
- Do you trust him?
That's hardly the point.
With no proof, it's just going to look like...
Like what?
Like you're jealous.
Without evidence, Ariadne will have no choice but to dismiss your claims.
- What?
So we just let her go?
- I see no other way.
Please.
Thank you for granting me a private audience.
Come, let us walk.
JASON:
The journey to Aegina is fraught with danger.
I am only thinking of your safety when I ask you to reconsider.
The route has been carefully planned.
Not just the route, the destination, the match.
Are you sure you can trust this man?
An alliance with Aegina will secure a future for the people of Atlantis.
If Telemon is to be trusted.
Well, I have heard nothing from our emissary.
Surely if there were a problem...
What do you know of his past?
Rather more than I do of yours, I suspect.
I know of the troubles he went through when he was young.
The difficulties he has with his father.
Does he tell you where he goes at night?
You have been spying on him?
- I fear for your safety.
- He is my future husband, not a prisoner.
What is he doing that worries you so?
Jason, I cannot do this.
- Atlantis is vulnerable.
- I know.
I know that.
And I understand that you have to marry.
Do you?
I have thought long and hard about marrying Telemon.
In the middle of the night, when it seems that dawn will never come,
I paced my chambers, hoping for a sign.
In those moments of conflict,
I always consider what my father would say.
He held Telemon's family in great respect
Jason.
I cannot be with you.
I'm sorry, I truly I am.
If there were a way, I...
We must never speak of this again.
My lady, if you don't trust me enough to advise you, at least let me protect you on the journey.
You would do this for me?
Then we leave at first light.
You need to pack.
- Where are we going?
- To protect the Queen.
You too.
We leave at dawn.
- For?
- Aegina.
We are accompanying Ariadne to her wedding?
- Of course.
- HERCULES:
Of course.
How do we protect a man so stubbornly ruled by his heart?
Presumably the Oracle foretold such difficulties.
Not to me, she didn't.
I am pleased to see you here.
I wouldn't be anywhere else.
No-one will think ill of you if you decide not to go.
Here we are.
Tell me something of your father.
What is it you wish to know?
His likes, dislikes, what makes him happy.
Everything.
Meeting you will make him happy.
You needn't worry so.
But you parted on bad terms.
He cannot fail to see how I have changed.
I'm sure he will attribute much of that to you.
I cannot claim that honour.
I think you can.
More than you know.
I'll feel better once the sun has risen.
Apparently, he sleeps with one eye open.
As do we.
I will take first watch.
You sleep.
The next stage is surely the most perilous.
I fear so, but I have made my decision.
We move into the desert and follow the course of the Phyria gorge.
You are a long way from the fire.
I'm sorry, I forgot myself.
I feel safer with you here.
I'll feel safer when you're back by the fire.
My lady.
As far as I can tell, he's not up to anything.
Perhaps this journey will end safely after all.
Perhaps.
If it does, I think we should find you another woman.
- Hmm.
- There are other women.
Really?
Hercules will find you one.
Oh, yes, I am spectacularly good at that kind of thing.
Putting aside the fact that my love sits cursed in a cave,
I'm happy to help.
Thank you, but I actually don't think it's such a bad thing being on your own.
Oh, absolutely, I agree.
Have you ever known anything else?
That's beside the point.
(LAUGHING)
What happened?
Nothing, he slept.
- You slept?
- No, I didn't.
The whole night.
I watched, he slept.
We must leave no trace of the camp.
Of course.
- We go through Phyria?
- Mmm-hmm.
JASON:
Is that wise?
I believe it is the last path the Colcheans will expect us to take.
He has done well.
The message is clear.
They are headed south, across the desert.
They will reach the Phyria gorge before sunset.
Make sure your men are ready.
Now do you doubt Telemon's loyalty?
I know what you're thinking.
This route wasn't chosen lightly.
I'm sure.
No bandit would dare attack a convoy this size.
Can we not pass by the north?
The last we heard it was overrun with Colcheans.
(GRUNTING)
(HORSE NEIGHING)
We have to get her to safety straightaway.
Help me.
This is what you wanted all along.
What are you waiting for?
Forgive me.
Head for the rocks!
Ariadne, come.
Run!
Ariadne, look at me.
Thank the gods you are safe.
JASON:
Did you see them?
HERCULES:
Colcheans?
It looks that way.
I shouldn't have doubted you.
You had your reasons.
Is it done?
It was carnage.
There are many dead.
And Ariadne?
What of the Queen?
I do not know.
But you killed her?
If you had been there...
I would have remembered the task I had to do.
In the heat of the moment, decisions have to be made.
So you decided to let her go?
(GRUNTS)
My lady, he is of royal blood.
I am the son of a king,
Apollo's servant on Earth.
Why risk the fury of the gods?
If you leave me here I will die.
That is for the gods to decide.
We must travel to the gorge to ensure Ariadne is dead.
I will find you.
I will not forget.
We must make a break for it whilst we have cover of darkness.
They're preparing to attack.
Hand me a weapon.
Draw the arrow to your eye.
Here they come.
(YELLING)
(PANTING)
Where did you learn to shoot like that?
My father taught me.
He believed that everyone should know how to defend themselves.
- Ow!
- Sorry.
We'd sneak out of the citadel early in the morning and head to the forest.
One of the only times we were ever alone.
You miss him?
More than you know.
(SIGHS) There.
You will live, for now.
There are scores of them.
I can see their torches.
It's barely an hour before dawn.
I fear we must leave everything, if we are to escape unnoticed.
- Dion!
- (GROANS)
- No!
Get back!
- In there!
- We were so close.
- We need to keep moving.
I left anything that might be useful back there.
Pass me that water.
Let's go, while we still have a chance.
- Can you stop the bleeding?
- For now.
Shh!
We can't stay here.
Come on.
(DION GROANING)
Over here!
Oh!
It's not her!
One of the archers saw a group fleeing the gorge.
- They tried to stop them, but...
- And Ariadne?
I fear she was amongst them.
Which direction did they go in?
North.
I doubt they will survive for long.
And you think we should leave it to chance?
No, my lady.
(DION GROANING)
That's the last of it.
Without rest and water, he will most certainly die.
Then we must rest.
DION:
Jason.
Jason.
You must get the Queen to safety.
Not until you're ready to move again.
I am not long for this world.
I am not leaving you here.
I will only slow you down.
Then I'll take that chance.
He wanted you to leave him here?
I knew there would come a point when he'd ask that of you.
He is thinking only of your safety.
And I knew you'd refuse.
We'd gain very little crossing the desert...
You don't have to justify yourself to me.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
They're badly wounded.
It cannot be long since they passed this way.
When we find them, leave Ariadne for me.
It is possible to survive for a number of days without water.
Really?
- Providing you rest.
- Rest?
And stay out of the sun.
We shall be all right then.
And without either of those things?
We'll be dead in a couple of days.
Impossible.
I intend to die with a beautiful woman in one hand, and a jug of ale in the other.
And you're going to look for them now?
No, I'm going to look for somewhere to, uh, contemplate my existence.
I'm not sure I deserve such loyalty.
No, you almost certainly do not.
Be serious.
I think Pythagoras covered the serious part.
In a couple of days we'll be dead.
And actually, what he didn't mention was they will be the most agonising days of your life.
Is that serious enough?
Look!
PYTHAGORAS:
Colcheans.
HERCULES:
No, travellers of some sort.
We may be saved after all.
Or slaughtered.
I'm just saying, they might not be friendly.
I think we'll have to take that chance.
They're turning.
Please forgive us.
Our journey has made us wary of strangers.
Even though we desperately need your help.
What of your friend?
I fear he will not survive much longer.
- We were attacked...
- We were attacked by robbers.
We are on our way to Paros, but without provisions we will not make the journey.
If you could escort us to the nearest town...
PYTHAGORAS:
We'd forever be in your debt.
The goddess would not wish us to abandon them.
We are bound for the Sanctuary of Isis at Philae.
You are welcome to journey with us.
We are most grateful.
ORPHEUS:
Ah, tell me, what takes you to Paros?
JASON:
Uh, we're merchants.
We're trying to sell our wares.
But not that any remain.
The lady?
- She's your wife?
- No.
Then you're brave indeed to make such a journey.
What do you sell?
Oh, pots.
Cooking pots.
Well, you were most unlucky to have so many cumbersome objects stolen from you.
Indeed.
- Horses.
- It's not possible.
There are more of them.
They are headed for the mountains.
It is of no matter.
We should catch them by nightfall.
Ah!
(GROANING)
(LAUGHING)
Dears, oh.
Thank you.
I shall feel happier when I'm on sturdier terrain.
(CHUCKLING) As will I.
You will be happier when you have your Queen safely home.
Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.
How did you know?
Orpheus may be blind, but he sees more than any man I have ever known.
Your journey is a long and arduous one.
It is our choice.
Only in suffering can we find our true selves.
Why does it have to be that way?
Would that it were different.
There is great sadness in your heart.
You have suffered much for one so young.
You speak as if you know me.
It is his gift.
The mantle that you've inherited weighs heavy on your soul,
but it will not always be so.
Though he may not have known it,
Minos prepared you well for the task ahead.
- You knew my father?
- Oh.
I was sad to hear of his demise.
Fortunately, there are very few people on this Earth consumed by pure evil.
Pasiphae is one.
Why couldn't he see that?
Sometimes we are blind to those we hold dearest.
Here we go, old friend.
I won't let this meal be your last.
- I am not sure I am hungry.
- But you will eat.
Your Highness.
Pasiphae will stop at nothing until I am dead.
And do you know what the strange thing is?
That doesn't scare me any more.
You must have great faith in your protectors.
Indeed I do.
If I fear anything it is their safety.
Maybe we should stay with the pilgrims, give our lives to the gods.
ARIADNE:
It seems to have served them well.
Do you think that we will live to be that old?
I don't know.
(CHUCKLES)
Tell me, is it a starry night?
Indeed.
I thought so.
The air is clear.
Peaceful.
Would that it could stay that way.
Here, let me help you.
I am grateful for everything you have done for us.
I just fear that we will only bring you trouble.
ORPHEUS:
Ha!
That is as may be.
Some things cannot be avoided.
Our paths have been fated to cross since the dawn of time.
No seer can really tell another man's moira.
But I sense that your momentous journey has only just begun, and that it will live long in the hearts of men.
- Tell me.
- Hmm?
Does it end well?
That I cannot answer.
But do not see it as a burden.
The gods mean it as a gift.
Thank you.
I doubt your suitor is allowed to keep you warm.
I have seen the looks that pass between you.
I am speaking out of turn.
Do not fear.
I am but a humble merchant, you may address me as such.
Would that were true.
You would give it all up for him?
No.
My people come first.
Love is a force as destructive as it is harmonious.
If I have learnt one thing, it is that it cannot be denied.
Sometimes it is necessary to deny it.
Bless you, my child, you have much to learn.
(TWIGS SNAPPING)
(YELLING)
- Here.
- I don't know how.
Don't be a fool, take it.
Go!
Go!
Get the others out of here.
I'll try and hold them off.
We must move.
- We cannot continue this way.
- Him and me both.
- Don't even think about it.
- But it's...
I'm still having nightmares about one-eyed monsters.
We wait for the others here.
(RUSTLING)
I thought I told you to flee.
Well, luckily for you, I don't like being told what to do.
Jason.
Jason, how many remain?
- Too many.
- (BOTH SIGH)
We'll take shelter in there.
Why is it always caves?
What is this place?
Look at the carvings.
They are tombs.
Hipparghos.
This is the ancient necropolis of King Hipparghos.
We should move on.
(GROANING)
The trail leads to the necropolis.
A half a dozen or so made it inside.
And Ariadne is with them?
I do not know for sure, but we can presume so.
Then why are your men idle?
They will not venture inside, my lady.
- What?
- I will speak to them.
It will do no good.
They believe no man who enters the necropolis ever returns.
(SCOFFS)
You may find your death in the necropolis, or you may meet it here.
Who will follow me?
Perhaps this will help make up your minds.
Bring him here.
Who is still afraid?
Then we will face them alone.
It's time now.
You no longer need me.
(SOBBING) I will always need you.
You are capable of more than you know.
(RUSTLING IN DISTANCE)
No!
Jason!
(ECHOING)
Pythagoras!
Go, go, go!
What are those things?
Why won't they die?
(CREATURE GROWLING)
Ripped By mstoll
I'm here to win the heart of Ariadne.
Am I too ambitious?
I'm not sure a prince can ever be too ambitious.
You were lucky.
It won't always be that way.
I would be honoured to accept your proposal.
O kletheisa thea, dorois esth' aphthonos aiei.
Alla kai hemeteren hupodekhnuso potna thuelen...
CHICKEN CLUCKS
CLUCKING STOPS
Nun didomen tode soi, kai soi kleos aphthiton est?
The wedding date is set?
We leave for Aegina in two days.
What news of the emissary Ariadne dispatched?
It would seem the road to Aegina is fraught with danger.
As our young Queen is about to find out.
I will persuade them towards Phyria.
~ That will give us the best chance of success.
~ And the Queen suspects nothing?
She knows I was estranged from my father.
Not that we never reconciled.
You have done well.
Indeed.
Now you must ensure that it was not in vain.
You doubt me?
And when Ariadne is dead?
Do not worry.
You will have your place in my court.
I wish I had your faith in him.
Do not fear.
Telemon is an exile in search of a home.
He will do anything to belong again.
Even kill a Queen?
Even that.
You have done well.
There is more.
Well, go on, then.
You have bled me dry.
HE SIGHS
Give me the benefit of your wisdom.
What else have you learnt?
He sleeps with one eye open.
What use is that to me?
Come back here!
I'll tan your hide!
You were right.
Prince Telemon's been out of the city.
All night.
Doing what?
I cannot say.
I made this journey but a week ago.
It would be foolish to enter King Agenor's territory.
King Agenor has always thought highly of Atlantis.
What of his relationship with my father?
I know nothing of this.
I would prefer not to make this journey at all.
What are you suggesting?
The Queen remains in Atlantis.
Well, then there can be no wedding.
I must have my father's blessing.
After everything that has gone between us, it is of utmost importance to me.
We travel to Aegina.
As you wish.
Might I make a suggestion?
We go by way of Phyria.
The Colcheans will have no patrols in the desert.
I will give it some consideration.
But I alone will know the chosen route.
It is as I have asked.
As you wish.
I cannot let her travel to Aegina unaware of the potential danger.
Jason...
You cannot burst in there with wild accusations.
Whatever else Telemon is, he is a prince.
And Ariadne's betrothed.
Do you trust him?
That's hardly the point.
With no proof, it's just going to look like...
Like what?
Like you're jealous.
Without evidence, Ariadne will have no choice but to dismiss your claims.
What?
Do we just let her go?
I see no other way.
Please.
Thank you for granting me a private audience.
Come, let us walk.
The journey to Aegina is fraught with danger.
I am only thinking of your safety when I ask you to... reconsider.
The route has been carefully planned.
Not just the route.
The destination.
The match.
Are you sure you can trust this man?
An alliance with Aegina will secure a future for the people of Atlantis.
If Telemon is to be trusted.
Well, I have heard nothing from our emissary.
~ Surely if there were a problem...
~ What do you know of his past?
Rather more than I do of yours, I suspect.
I know of the troubles he went through when he was young and the difficulties he has with his father.
Does he tell you where he goes at night?
You have been spying on him?
~ I fear for your safety. ~ He is my future husband.
Not a prisoner.
What's he doing that worries you so?
Jason, I cannot do this.
Atlantis is vulnerable...
I know, I know that and I understand that you have to marry.
Do you?
I have thought long and hard about marrying Telemon.
In the middle of the night when it seems that dawn will never come,
I have paced my chambers, hoping for a sign.
In those moments of conflict, I always consider what my father would say.
He held Telemon's family in great respect.
Jason.
I cannot be with you.
I am sorry.
I truly am.
If there were a way...
We must never speak of this again.
My lady, if you don't trust me enough to advise you, at least let me protect you on the journey.
You would do this for me?
Then we leave at first light.
~ You need to pack.
~ Where are we going?
To protect the Queen.
You too.
We leave at dawn.
~ For?
~ Aegina.
We are accompanying Ariadne to her wedding?
Of course.
Of course!
How do we protect a man so stubbornly ruled by his heart?
Presumably the Oracle foretold such difficulties.
Not to me she didn't.
I am pleased to see you here.
I wouldn't be anywhere else.
No-one will think ill of you if you decide not to go.
Here you go.
Tell me something of your father.
What is it you wish to know?
His likes, dislikes.
What makes him happy?
Everything!
Meeting you will make him happy.
You needn't worry so.
But you parted on bad terms.
And he cannot fail to see how I have changed.
I am sure he will attribute much of that to you.
I cannot claim that honour.
I think you can.
More than you know.
I will feel better once the sun has risen.
Apparently, he sleeps with one eye open!
As do we.
I will take first watch.
You sleep.
The next stage is surely the most perilous.
I fear so.
But I have made my decision.
We move into the desert and follow the course of the Phyria gorge.
You are a long way from the fire.
I'm sorry.
I forgot myself.
I feel safer with you here.
I will feel safer when you are back by the fire.
My lady.
As far as I can tell, he's not up to anything.
Perhaps this journey will end safely after all.
Perhaps.
If it does, I think we should find you another woman.
There are other women.
Really?
Hercules will find you one.
Oh, yes, I am spectacularly good at that kind of thing.
Putting aside the fact that my love sits cursed in a cave,
I'd be happy to help.
Thank you, but I actually don't think it's such a bad thing being on your own.
Oh, absolutely, I agree.
Have you ever known anything else?
That's beside the point.
What happened?
Nothing.
He slept.
You slept?
No...
I didn't.
The whole night.
I watched.
He slept.
We must leave no trace of the camp.
Of course.
We go through Phyria?
Mm-hmm.
Is that wise?
I believe it is the last path the Colcheans will expect us to take.
He has done well.
The message is clear.
They are heading south, across the desert.
They will reach the Phyria gorge before sunset.
Make sure your men are ready.
Now, do you doubt Telemon's loyalty?
I know what you're thinking.
This route wasn't chosen lightly.
I'm sure.
No bandit would dare attack a convoy this size.
Can we not pass by the north?
The last we heard, it was overrun with Colcheans.
HE GROANS
ARROWS SWOOSH
HE GASPS
We have to get her to safety straightaway.
Help me.
This is what you wanted all along.
What are you waiting for?
Forgive me.
Head for the rocks!
Ariadne.
Come on.
Run!
Ariadne, look at me.
Thank the Gods you are safe.
Did you see them?
~ Colcheans?
~ It looks that way.
ARROWS SWOOSH
I shouldn't have doubted you.
You had your reasons.
SHOUTS OF BATTLE CONTINUE
Is it done?
It was carnage.
There are many dead.
And Ariadne?
What of the Queen?
~ I do not know.
~ But you killed her?
If you had been there...
I would have remembered the task I had to do.
In the heat of the moment, decisions have to be made.
So you decided to let her go?
HE GROANS
My Lady, he is of royal blood.
I am the son of a King - Apollo's servant on earth.
Why risk the fury of the Gods?
~ If you leave me here, I will die.
~ That is for the Gods to decide.
We must travel to the gorge to ensure Ariadne is dead.
THUD
I will find you.
I will not forget.
We must make a break for it whilst we have cover of darkness.
They're preparing to attack.
Hand me a weapon.
Draw the arrow to your eye.
Here they come.
SHOUTING
Where did you learn to shoot like that?
My father taught me.
He believed that everyone should know how to defend themselves.
HE WINCES Sorry...
We would sneak out of the citadel early in the morning and head to the forest.
It was one of the only times we were ever alone.
You miss him.
More than you know.
There...
You'll live.
For now.
There are scores of them.
I can see their torches.
It's barely an hour before dawn.
I fear we must leave everything if we are to escape unnoticed.
ARROW SWOOSHES
Dion!
HE GROANS
Get back!
In there!
We were so close.
We need to keep moving.
I left anything that might be useful back there.
Pass me that water.
Le's go while we still have a chance.
It will stop the bleeding.
For now.
GROANS
We can't stay here.
Come on.
DION GROANS
Over here.
It's not her!
One of the archers saw a group fleeing the gorge.
~ They tried to stop them, but...
~ And Ariadne?
~ I fear she was amongst them.
~ Which direction did they go?
North.
I doubt they will survive for long.
~ And you think we should leave it to chance?
~ No, my lady.
That's the last of it.
Without rest and water, he will most certainly die.
Then we must rest.
Jason...
Jason.
You must get the Queen to safety.
Not until you're ready to move again.
I am not long for this world.
I am not leaving you here.
I will only slow you down.
Then I'll take that chance.
He wanted you to leave him here?
I knew there would come a point when he'd ask that of you.
He is thinking only of your safety.
And I knew you would refuse.
We would gain very little, crossing the desert...
You do not have to justify yourself to me.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
They're badly wounded.
It cannot be long since they passed this way.
When we find them, leave Ariadne for me.
It is possible to survive for a number of days without water.
Really?
~ Providing you rest... ~ Rest?
!
And stay out of the sun.
Should be all right, then(!
)
And without either of those things,
~ we'll be dead in a couple of days.
~ Impossible.
I intend to die with a beautiful woman in one hand, and a jug of ale in the other.
And you're going to look for them now?
No, I'm going to look for a somewhere to... contemplate my existence.
I'm not sure that I deserve such loyalty.
No, you almost certainly do not.
Be serious.
I think Pythagoras covered the serious part.
In a couple of days, we'll be dead.
And actually, what he didn't mention was they will be the most agonising days of your life.
Is that serious enough?
Look!
Colcheans!
No, travellers of some sort.
We may be saved after all.
Or slaughtered.
I'm just saying - they might not be friendly.
I think we'll have to take that chance.
They're turning.
Please forgive us.
Our journey has made us wary of strangers.
Even though we desperately need your help.
What of your friend?
I fear he will not survive much longer.
We were attacked...
We were attacked by robbers.
We are on our way to Paros, but without provisions we will not make the journey.
If you could escort us to the nearest town.
We would for ever be in your debt.
The goddess would not wish us to abandon them.
We are bound for the Sanctuary of Isis at Philae.
You are welcome to journey with us.
We are most grateful.
Tell me, what takes you to Paros?
We are merchants, we're trying to sell our wares.
Not that any remain.
And the lady?
She is your wife?
No.
Then you are brave indeed to make such a journey.
What do you sell?
Oh, er, pots...

You're just so good, you make the rest of us look bad.

Should I dye my hair?

She wants to see the twins to make amends.

Right, so you're looking for really pretty armor?
No.

Mat can be a little confrontational.
Ok, a lot confrontational.
I mean, the boy feels the need to say everything he thinks.
So I wanna be pretty but protected.
Attractive, just not vulnerable.
Yeah.
Like you.
- You want some syrup for that, bud?
- Mm-hm.
- Since when do you work Sundays?
- I'm escorting a funeral.
Since Mama and Jude aren't gonna be back until tomorrow,
I thought I'd pick up a little off-duty security work.
Unless you don't want me to go.
That fire was pretty intense.
I can cancel, you know.
No, no.
I have therapy anyway.
I'm fine.
Ok.
You sure?
- Yeah, I'm just happy everyone got out safe.
- Yeah.
Where's everybody now?
All the girls, I mean?
They went back to juvie, until they can find a new place, if they can find place.
What does that mean?
Well, I guess there aren't many landlords who wanna rent to a group home, so...
Well, I'm sure they'll find something.
Rita doesn't strike me as the type of person who'd gives up easily.
[Jesus] So what time is the funeral gonna be over?
Planning another party?
Whaddaya mean?
I was just asking.
I have a big paper I'm writing.
It'd be easier to have no one here to distract me.
Well I have a music thing with Lou downtown, so I won't be here.
Oh yeah?
Why don't you... maybe you could take Callie with you.
Oh no, I don't wanna crash your thing.
It's not a thing.
We're just hanging.
You should come.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I could pick you up after therapy.
Um, ok, well I'll think about it.
I'll call you after I'm done.
Ok.
Hey Miss Thang.
Nice jacket.
Cute, right?
Thank you.
Like I had a choice.
When are Mama and Jude coming home?
At least they're nice to me.
Oh, poor baby.
They'll be back tomorrow.
How's she doing?
Uh, she's doing... she's doing all right, I think.
Yeah, it's been good for her being out in nature, you know, getting a little time off, a little time away.
We all have to be extra sweet to her when she gets back.
Losing a baby, is it's one of the hardest things you can possibly go through.
All right, I gotta go.
Oh, hey, B, will you drop this off at your dad's on your way out?
Um... can't you?
Yes I can but I asked you to.
Thank you.
All right, my babies, I'll see you later.
All right.
How's your dad doing, after the breakup?
It's so weird.
Didn't Dani just move in?
What happened?
Um, I dunno.
He's fine.
It's none of our business.
[knocking]
- Hey.
- Hey.
Sorry I shoulda called.
Mom asked me to...
- Oh, thanks.
- No problem.
I'd make you come in and have breakfast, but I'm heading out in a minute.
It's cool.
I have stuff to do anyway.
Ok.
I'll see ya soon?
Yeah, sure.
♪ It's not where you come from ♪
♪ It's where you belong ♪
♪ Nothing I would trade I wouldn't have it any other way ♪
♪ You're surrounded by love and you're wanted ♪
♪ So never feel alone ♪
♪ You are home with me right where you belong ♪
[sighs] Sorry about that.
I just...
I'm not ready to get into this, with him.
No, don't worry about it.
I wasn't really ready to face him either.
[sighs] Guess I can add him to my amends list.
He's already at the top of mine.
Uh...
You... wanna read the next part?
Sure.
"We have a list of all persons we have harmed and to whom we are willing to make amends.
We made it when we took inventory.
We subjected ourselves to a drastic self-appraisal.
Now we go out to our fellows and repair the damage done in the past."
So why all the secrecy?
What kind of music festival is this?
Is it like a rave?
An underground warehouse death-metal battle of the bands?
Yup.
I'm totally bringing you to 'The Seven Levels of Hell, a Sound Experience That Will Explode Your Eardrums!
'
I'm kidding.
Look.
[traditional Latin music playing]
[people chattering]
Nice.
So when did these panic attacks start?
Well, I've been seeing Wyatt for a while now.
Uh-huh.
And we decided we wanted to have sex.
Ok.
Is that something you feel like you're ready for?
With Wyatt, I mean?
I do.
I did, anyway.
But when we tried, I freaked out.
I couldn't breathe and I pushed him off of me.
It's been happening a few times a week since.
I even thought I saw Liam the other day, at work.
I think...
Do you think it's him, Liam?
You mean, do I think the rape is the cause of the panic attacks?
Maybe.
But things like that generally start closer to the time of the event.
- Do you trust Wyatt?
- Yeah, completely.
But you also thought you could trust Liam, right?
And you were wrong.
So how can you trust your own judgment?
You think I can't trust my judgment?
No.
I think you think you can't.
Especially when it comes to making yourself so vulnerable to another person.
I think if you trusted yourself.
I wouldn't have panicked with Wyatt.
I think it's a possibility.
So, what am I supposed to do?
Did you see any signs that Liam wasn't who he pretended to be?
Um, I guess, yeah.
People show us who they are, what they're capable of,
If we're paying attention, listening to our gut, that's how we learn to trust ourselves, by trusting we will act on our instincts to keep ourselves safe.
You say you trust Wyatt completely so trust your instincts.
Until he gives you a reason not to.
- Hey!
- Sorry!
We're almost there.
Where are you taking me?
I'm not telling you.
That's kinda the point of the blindfold.
Fine.
[hip hop music playing]
What is this?
This is where we, you know, the first time.
It'll be like our first date all over again.
You mean our first hookup?
By the way, we haven't even had a real first date.
Is this all you think I am?
Some girl to get naked with in your garage?
No!
No.
This is romantic.
Look flower petals.
I... picked these myself.
So this is it, huh?
Your plan for our big "special date?"
Sex on a nasty old couch?
No!
No, this is, um, this is just part one.
I just wanted to spend some time alone together 'cause no one's home.
Then I was gonna take you out.
Where?
- [Stef] Hello?
- Um...
Oh, God.
Just wait.
[Stef] Hello?
Hi, Hayley.
How are ya?
Hi.
Hi.
Mom, I thought you were supposed to be working that funeral?
I can see that that's what you thought.
But, well, they had to cancel.
Someone forgot to dig the grave. [Chuckles]
- So... what's up?
- Just hanging out.
Uh-huh, well, you know the rules:
no hanging out with girls behind closed doors.
That's not fair.
What if I was gay?
- Are you?
Gay?
- No, but...
Point taken.
Then I guess there's no hanging out with anyone behind closed doors, that includes garage doors too.
All right, we were on our way out, anyway.
I see.
And what about that big paper that you had to work on?
I'll finish it tonight.
You ready?
I'll just finish blowing out these candles for you, bit of a fire hazard there, Jesus.
- Hey.
- Hey, yo.
- Hey.
- Sorry to crash.
No worries.
The more, the merrier.
Well, thank you.
Um, I'm glad you say that, actually.
Hey.
Good to see ya.
- You know Lou, right?
- Yeah we met at your party.
So what is this?
Some kinda Mexican street festival?
Seems cool.
Yeah, there's a main stage over there and they usually play some pretty great music.
Nice.
Cool.
Well, um, why don't we meet up with you there later?
- Wyatt and I are gonna have a chow-down.
- We are?
Mm-hmm, yeah, we're both gonna eat one item from every food stall, and the first person to say "uncle," has to pay for it all.
Wait, so you think you're gonna out eat me?
No, I know I'm gonna out-eat you.
Ok, it's on, girl.
How about we start with a little spicy corn, to line the stomach?
Yeah, how about it?
Let's do it.
- We're not doing that, right?
- No.
- Ok, all right, cool.
Let's go this way.
- All right.
My grandfather used to bring me here every year.
He's a musician.
He loves Latin music.
- You like her?
- Who?
Frida Kahlo.
Um...
I dunno.
I mean, she could stand to tweeze a little.
Wait, you've never heard of Frida Kahlo?
No.
Why?
Because I'm a Mexican?
No, because she's...
like a cultural icon.
Yeah, a Mexican cultural icon.
Yeah, but no, she's kind of international?
Well I didn't really grow up in a Latino home, so...
No, that's not what I meant.
Is something wrong?
No.
Wyatt?
Wyatt?
Hey.
- You ok?
- Yeah.
Not exactly, no.
Ok, well, why not?
Um, I've been having these panic attacks, ever since we tried to...
Really?
It's not your fault at all.
Um...
I'm just trying to...
I'm supposed to practice trusting myself.
I know that sounds dumb but it's actually harder than you think.
Oh.
Anyway, I didn't really wanna come here today 'cause the crowds and everything.
But I know that one of the things I can trust is you, so...
I'm right here.
I was just getting these.
- For you, my lady.
- [chuckles]
Nerd.
Unless you're full?
I mean, we can stop, anytime you want.
All you've gotta do is say the word.
- No, No, I'm starving.
- You're starving, huh?
- Mm-hm.
- You'll definitely enjoy this meatball then.
- Yeah, cheers.
Mm-hm.
- Cheers.
Mmmm.
Delicious.
Right?
Tamale?
Unless you've had enough.
Baby, we are just getting started.
- Mmm.
- Mm-hm.
I'm really glad you called.
Me, too.
Hey, Liam.
I'm hungry, man.
Let's go.
[Lena] I'm so glad you're getting the day off, you deserve it.
It'll be good for you, a little quiet time to yourself.
[chuckles] Not really sure what I'm gonna do with myself.
You don't have to do anything.
Why not just... be?
- [chuckles]
- I'm serious.
That's what's been so great about this trip.
All this time out in the woods has really let me connect, you know, with... this.
Ok, Earth Mother.
I got it.
We're both grieving, honey.
Yeah. [Clears throat] I know.
I'm ok.
Ok.
Maybe you could,
I dunno, meditate or something?
[laughs]
I mean it.
I know you do.
That's what scares me.
I will try it, sweetheart.
Thank you.
I love you.
I love you, too.
[exhales deeply]
[sighs] [water dripping]
_
Oh, my God, this is so cool!
How did you know about this?
I told you, I wanted to do something that's really special, so I did a bunch of research on all the cool events that were happening this weekend.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
I'm very impressed.
- And hungry.
- Yeah?
Let's go get you a taco.
You know what?
I read the best tacos are actually over here.
Wow you did do your research.
Thank you.
[traditional Latin music]
You like this?
Hear that rhythm line?
It's so intricate.
What's that?
- It's a Guitarrán.
Yeah.
- A Guitarrán.
It's like a bass.
But so much more.
It's totally the backbone of the band.
What?
Nothing.
I just didn't realize you were into all these different kinds of music.
You're full of surprises.
There's more where that came from.
And of course Jesus and sweet Mariana.
"Taking money from her to buy drugs was probably the worst thing I ever did."
I mean, how am I supposed to make amends to those two?
What'd your sponsor say?
"Staying sober's a good start."
But I get it.
I feel the same way about Brandon.
Yeah, you didn't abandon your son.
No.
Not literally.
But I did it in all kinds of other ways.
I mean, the relationship with Dani...
I shoulda never started that so soon after I got sober.
I had Brandon living here with me.
I shoulda made him a priority, instead of...
And it goes all the way back.
After the divorce, I shoulda fought for custody.
Or at least partial custody.
But the truth is, I didn't think I could handle it.
And it's a lot harder to drink all the time with a little kid running around.
I managed.
With two of 'em.
To drink, use coke, use crystal, some heroin.
[scoffs]
It doesn't even matter Stef and Lena are never gonna let me see them again.
They made that perfectly clear.
It's too bad.
I think it's a mistake, not just for you.
What would you say to them?
I mean, if you could?
Um...
This is really hard.
You know what?
We did a lot of work today.
You... wanna take a break?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ok.
[traditional Latin music continues]
Best in town.
Well, that's what they say, anyway.
Thanks.
Callie?
- What're you doing here?
- Oh, we tagged along with Brandon and Lou.
They're here, too?
Where are they?
Oh, I don't know we split up with them a little while ago.
We're gonna meet them later though for the concert.
Oh yay!
We'll join you.
Hey, you know what I think we need?
I think we need some dulce de leche, something sweet.
Yeah, no, I think that's exactly what we need
- Hey, but no puking!
Puking's against the rules!
- Mm-hmm.
[groans]
I don't wanna be one to toot my own horn.
Generally, I prefer you to do that.
But since you're not here, I guess I'm going to have to indulge in a little self-congratulation.
Check out that pipe!
Look at that!
No more leaky pipe!
No more emptying the bowl into the toilet anymore.
How hot is that pipe, huh?
How hot is that pipe?
And how hot is your mama, huh?
In her hot tool belt?
In her hot tool belt?
Using power tools, oh, yeah, fixing things.
Look at that pipe.
Look at that pipe.
[water trickling]
Oh, crap!
Oh, crap!
[traditional Latin music continues]
Wow.
That's intense.
- You should get one.
- [chuckles]
One:
I'm not 18 and two:
I'd like to live to be 18, which I don't think would happen if my moms found out I got one of those.
You don't have to be 18, for the record, not at a place like this.
Really?
Nice.
What is it?
It's a Triple Spiral.
It's the Wiccan symbol of feminine power.
I've got another one, but I can't really show it to you here.
Uh, what time does stuff start on the main stage?
So you're not into me?
Is that what's happening?
Because it's either that or you're completely oblivious,
- and I'm pretty sure you're not that stupid.
- No, I...
I mean, I basically just offered to let you see me naked.
I'm not oblivious, ok, and I'm not stupid.
I'm just...
You're not over Callie?
Not into me?
- No.
- Then what?
- Hey, Brandon, Liam's here.
- What?
- Liam's here!
- What... ?
Hang on, Wyatt?
- I gotta go.
- Who's Liam?
He's this guy who...
I'll tell you later, all right?
Wyatt?
Hey, slow down.
What are you doing?
I saw him over there.
I lost him.
You were following him?
Yeah.
I don't want Callie to see him.
Then let's grab Callie and get outta here.
No why should Callie be the one who has to leave?
Hey, dude, think about this.
This is not a good idea.
Hey, the concert's about to start, do you think we could...
You guys go ahead, yeah, I'm sure Wyatt's just gonna be a second.
I'll meet you there.
Save us a seat though.
Ok.
Hurry.
Uh, can we stop by the ladies room on our way?
Excuse me.
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
Whoa!
What are you guys doing here?
I told you I was coming here this morning.
Never mind.
Damn it.
I gotta go.
So you did a bunch of research, huh?
Was that just stealing your brother's idea, or was there more to it than that?
So really you just wanted to use me?
For sex?
No.
No.
That's not it at all.
I like you.
I really like you.
You know, there are plenty of guys out there that would treat me like this.
- I thought you were different.
- I am, I really am different.
I mean it.
What do I have to do to prove it to you?
[man] So you wanna make sure it's in there as close as you can get it.
And give it a whack.
I shouldn't say "whack".
I mean, tap it, very gently.
Well, look who's here?
Hey, Mike!
Hey.
Ana and I...
We're working the program together.
I got 60 days, 60 days clean.
I wrote Stef and Lena.
I wrote your moms.
I told them I wanted to see you, and Jesus just to tell you how sorry I am.
I can't.
I don't wanna...
I can't do this...
Whoa whoa, let's just go somewhere and talk, ok?
Why?
So she can lie to me again?
No.
No.
Hey, Mariana!
Mariana?
Hey!
Hey!
What's going on?
Are you ok?
No, I'm not.
Why did you bring me here?
Is it because I'm not Latin enough?
Is it because I dyed my hair?
Why?
No, I brought you here because I love it.
I wanted to share it with you.
Oh, because I'm Mexican?
If I were Korean, would you take me to Koreatown?
If I wanted good barbecue, yeah.
Ok, I don't get it, are you offended that I brought you to a festival that actually celebrates yr culture?
I mean, it's not like I made you wear a sombrero and do tequila shots.
Well, I'm sorry, this isn't my culture.
Didn't you show me a picture of your Quinceanera?
That was just a party.
Look, I grew up with Stef and Lena.
I didn't eat churros, or dance flamenco...
Flamenco's not Mexican.
Don't do that!
See?
This is what I mean!
This isn't me.
I don't have any connection to any of this!
- I don't feel anything!
- Well, you clearly feel something.
Why are you yelling at me?
Is this about that woman?
Who was that?
Hey, Liam?
Hey, you need to get the hell outta here.
Callie is here.
I don't want her seeing you.
So for once in your life, do the right thing and get the hell outta here.
- Why don't you get out?
- Man, haven't you put her through enough?
What about what she put me through?
Huh?
- What are you talking about?
- Accusing me like she did, dragging me into court, in front of my parents and the whole freaking world.
So what, you're saying you didn't rape her?
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
I had sex with her, but trust me, she wanted it.
Hey!
Hey!
Wyatt, stop!
Stop!
Come on!
Hey, break it up!
Hey, that's enough!
Want me to call the cops?
No.
Ok, folks, move on.
Show's over.
Well, that was something.
That guy, he, um did some bad stuff to Callie.
And you just had to jump in to defend her.
I'm kidding.
I'm sure you had your reasons.
You're pretty rock-n-roll, Foster.
I mean, you're an idiot, but... come on.
I'm sorry.
I'm just kind of in a bad place right now.
I can't.
It's not you, ok?
And it's not Callie.
It's me.
I promise.
I'm sorry.
Let's get outta here.
Callie!
Hey!
What?
What did I do?
I was just trying to protect you.
- I know.
- Then what did I do wrong?
That's not the kind of protection I want, Wyatt.
I told you, ok?
I needed you today.
I needed you.
To be with me.
I told myself that I could trust you but I guess I was wrong.
You know how I feel about violence, or do you not remember me screaming at you the last time that you picked a fight with Liam.
I can't believe we're having this fight again.
I was...
I was just trying to take care of you, Callie.
Well, maybe you don't know how to do that.
[groans] [labored breathing]
Oh, God!
[Screaming]
[sighs]
[sobs quietly]
[soft rock music]
[cell phone rings]
- Hi, honey.
- [Lena] Hi.
I was just calling to say I got your video?
I sent it?
Yeah, I called the plumber.
He's on the way.
Ok, thank you.
Hey, are you ok?
I miss the baby.
We didn't even know her and I miss her so much.
I know, me too.
[sobs]
Thanks for the heads up.
[door opens]
Hey.
What the hell happened?
- That hurts.
- [Mike] It's supposed to hurt.
What are you doin', getting in fights, anyway?
Your hand just got better...
I know, I know.
I was trying to stop it, honest.
But once I saw Liam, I got so mad, I...
I couldn't.
Who you really mad at, B?
Liam?
Sure, maybe.
He deserves some anger, but I gotta say,
I don't think that's really what this was about.
I think you're mad at me.
and I think you're mad at yourself.
I want you to forgive yourself for what happened with Dani.
And I want you to forgive me for bringing her into our lives in the first place.
I'm so sorry, Dad.
I know you are.
I'm sorry, too.
You can't avoid hurting the people you love.
That's just what happens.
That's... that's family.
But I got a feeling we're gonna be making amends to each other for the rest of our lives.
The only thing that matters is we keep doing it.
[soft rock music]
♪ Funny how a photograph ♪
♪ Can take you far away... ♪
Hey.
Hey.
No, that can't have been fun, seeing Liam.
You all right, my love?
And Wyatt, how is he?
Um, a little bruised but he'll be fine.
I get that he was just trying to protect me, but another fight?
What good is that gonna do anyone, you know?
You're so amazing, you know that?
You come here.
Mmm.
You and me, we're a lot alike.
We think we gotta be strong, tough, think we gotta get with things and...
You know, sometimes you do and sometimes...
Sometimes, you just gotta let yourself fall apart.
And there's no shame in that.
Not even a little.
[approaching footsteps]
Mariana, is that you?
Nope, it's just me.
Oh.
Where you been all day?
Just out with Hayley.
Hmm.
Have you talked with your sister?
Mariana?
No, why?
I'll talk to you about it later.
Ok.
I should get back to that paper I was working on.
Yeah, you should.
You been talking about that all day.
- [door closes] - [sighs]
- What am I gonna do with him?
- [chuckles]
I don't know.
[both chuckling]
I don't know either.
[slow guitar music]
I don't hate being Latin.
I mean, how could you?
I just...
Ana's the only connection I have to being Mexican, you know?
And I hate her so much.
If you knew half of what she's done to my family...
I just think today, you know, seeing all of this, it just reminded me of her, the part of me that makes me feel so awful about myself.
I'm sorry I was such a bitch today.
No.
Remember when I told you how my dad left when I was six?
Well, my mom always used to tell us it had nothing to do with us, that he was a total mess with a ton of problems.
But even so,
I still can't believe he's never called, he's never come by, not even to make sure we were alive, you know?
I shouldn't care but I just think if if I could hear him say I'm sorry just once, that would be something, you know?
[speaks Spanish]
Oh.
[speaks Spanish]
[door opens]
- [Stef] Hey.
How was it?
- Good.
It was good.
Mike stopped by and he said that he ran into you.
And he was with Ana.
Did she really send you a letter, asking if she could see us?
She did.
Well I want to.
See her.
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs have been at war in London.
The Jews have been having the worst of it.
They need allies.
Tell us your plan.
I can offer you 100 good men.
Get him out of there, get him back!
Arthur killed a boy.
Polly, these are the files for Michael and Anna Gray.
Your daughter is dead.
But, Pol, Michael is alive.
I'm looking for someone called Elizabeth Gray.
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?
I think she might be my mother.
There's an old friend of ours coming back to the city.
He's head of some secret department, the Irish Desk.
He was murdered this morning in a street show in the Patch.
He was Irish.
Is he a person of interest to your department, sir?
Do you read the papers?
Birmingham papers.
I recommend the Daily Mail.
It will broaden your mind.
Now, if you read the national press, you would know that the king has offered the rebel Irish a treaty.
Now, some of the Fenians want to accept it.
The IRA do not.
Now, the IRA have a long and glorious relationship with the garrotte.
Oh, dear.
Are they fighting amongst themselves, are they, sir?
- That will be all.
- Right, sir.
Oh, Moss, I'm going to be up and down from London quite a bit.
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?
Well, you wouldn't want to stay in the lodgings you had last time then, sir, eh?
Too many bad memories, I suppose.
You should understand, Moss,
I have no regrets about my previous mission in this city.
No, sir?
I imagine you boys have quite a laugh at my expense.
A laugh, sir?
You think it's funny that I developed feelings?
No idea what you're talking about, sir.
I have no regrets about what happened with Miss Burgess.
No "bad memories".
Right, sir.
He's losing his bloody mind.
Next.
Next.
All right, then.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
The Dig...
What are you?
A boxer?
Digbeth Kid like Billy the Kid.
Spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?
Cowboy pictures?
Tom Mix?
Yeah?
What are you...
Wait, wait.
It's not a real gun.
- Let's have a look then, eh?
- It's made of wood.
Bang.
Bang.
Very nice.
Where did you get the gun belt?
My sister made it out of an old blacksmith's apron.
My mum did most of the stitching.
She's not my real mum, but...
She does what mothers do.
So she made you a gun belt.
All right then, mother's boy.
There's the door.
On you go.
We're looking for...
Have you ever been arrested?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- No.
- Good.
You're the first bloke we've had in here today with no criminal record.
Arthur, we can stand him up.
Do you know what that means?
The new Home Secretary wants something done about illegal gambling.
Damn right.
About bloody time.
So we help our coppers make their quota of convictions by having men stood up to be arrested.
First offence, you'll get a week inside.
We'll give you five quid for your trouble.
How does that sound, cowboy?
Yeah.
Good.
Write your address down for Finn on your way out.
I can't write.
That's all right, Finn can't read.
Don't worry.
Just tell him your address and we'll send someone round.
If the sheriff don't run you out of town first.
Good man.
- Oh, I don't know, Tom.
Kids these days.
- Hmm.
They didn't fight.
So they're different.
They stay kids.
How was it?
I was starving, so I would have eaten anything.
But really it was super.
Super.
So, uh, are you a cook?
Not a cook.
No.
The man who came to the house, he was driving a posh car.
He looks rich.
What does he do?
- He works with horses.
- Really?
I love horses.
- I've got a bay mare.
- No!
I ride it all the time.
Then it's in the blood.
I've got about a million questions.
So do I.
I've had different pictures in my head.
Well, here I am.
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?
I don't have any choice.
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?
We don't choose.
And that's it.
Yeah, that's right.
God gave you to me.
People took you away.
And it is all right that it's me, isn't it?
In a place like this.
I thought it would be worse.
Run for the hills!
It's the Digbeth Kid!
Get out of town, kid, or I will shoot your fucking head off!
Time's up!
- You're dead, go down.
- John!
All right then, Polly.
Who's this?
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.
Pleased to meet you.
John.
I'm Arthur.
You've already met me.
I used to throw you out of the window, so John could catch you.
I used to put you in a shoebox and kick you down Watery Lane.
I bet you're glad to be back.
I don't remember any of it.
All I remember is the day they took me away.
Well, you're here now, son.
Welcome to the Shelby family.
Later on, we'll show you the ropes.
Hmm.
Yeah, we'll show you what's what.
Let's leave him be for now, eh?
Come on, boys.
Nice suit.
They seem nice.
Here he is, Mr Inconspicuous.
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.
How are you feeling?
I've just come out of bandages myself.
Ready for active service.
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.
It's all right, Bill.
You don't have to stand in line for us.
It's men like you we're looking for, Billy.
But you have to pass the medical first.
Sheffield mob showed up at Wincanton trotting track.
I took a bullet.
When do the bandages come off?
When I take 'em off.
One week.
Not before.
You'll smell no rot.
There's no gangrene.
It's been a long time.
Eh, Billy?
What did you do with your medals?
Threw them in the cut.
Same as you.
It was never a hardship having you Black Country boys on our left flank.
And you Brummies did all right on our right.
Damn right.
I want you to be the head of a brigade, Bill.
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.
You'll have 100 men under your command.
And now we've got a member of the Kitchen family on the payroll, maybe your cousins and brothers will let our boats pass through the Black Country without being held up and robbed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Go home, Bill.
Round up any good men you can trust and put the word out.
Black Country boys and Brummie boys are on the same side again.
That'll be the bloody day.
Well, this is the bloody day.
London, man.
There for the taking.
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.
Polly said you had one in the pub.
All right, be quick.
I have business.
Sir.
Polly said you own this place.
She said you own lots of different businesses.
You call her Polly or Mum?
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.
Who are you calling?
My mother.
I mean...
I know what you mean.
And what are you going to tell her?
I'm going to tell her where I am.
And now you're going to tell her you're going home.
Polly said I could stay for a few days.
- You want to stay?
- I've only just arrived.
What age are you Michael?
Seventeen.
Seventeen.
Which means it's not up to you, right?
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.
You smoke?
No.
Drink?
You're going to call your mother, going to tell her you're getting the next train home.
And when you get there, you're going to write a letter to Polly saying when you're 18, you'll come back here and sort things out.
I just told you.
I make up my own mind.
Do you know what we do, Michael?
We, Shelbys.
Yes.
I think I know what you do.
Yeah.
You've got smart eyes.
But you're young, so you think what we do is all right.
It's not all right.
People get hurt.
Now, call your mother and I will drive you to the station.
No.
In my village, there's this little wishing well.
It's made of white bricks, right in the middle of the village green.
Everybody says how pretty it is.
But I swear to God, if I spend another day in that village,
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.
Probably blow my hands off with it, but it'd be worth it.
Just to see all those pretty white bricks spread over the pretty village green.
Hmm.
Yep.
You're Polly's son, all right.
All right boys, let's go to work.
Let's be having it!
Don't wait!
Keep it moving.
Move!
Next lad!
Name?
Abbey Heath.
Abbey Heath.
Profession?
Baker.
Good lad.
Fill it out and fuck off.
Next lad!
Name?
Buddy Halls.
Buddy Halls.
Right.
Profession?
Baker.
Good lad.
Fill it out and fuck off.
Next lad!
- Name?
- Billy Kitchen.
Billy Kitchen.
Occupation?
Head baker.
Fill it out.
Um, Tommy Shelby, mate.
Never give power to the big man, what did I tell you?
Hmm?
Never give power to the big man.
Next lad!
Name?
All right, boys, you've now all been enrolled as bakers in the Aerated Bread Company of Camden Town.
If anyone asks, that's what you do.
You're bakers.
The coppers in Camden Town are on our side, but north or south, you show them that piece of paper.
Tell them you've come down from north to find work, to break strikes.
Tell them you're fascists, if you have to.
We're finding lodgings for you, but for now you'll sleep here in the bakery.
But don't touch any of the bread, it'll most likely explode.
Any questions?
Yes?
I haven't even seen any bread.
He'll wake up.
Granted, he won't have any teeth left, but he will be a wiser man for it.
And the last thing he will remember is your funny little joke.
Won't he?
Right!
There are fucking rules here.
Yeah, there are fucking rules for a fucking reason.
Quite simply, they have to be obeyed.
All right?
Rule number one.
The distinction between bread and rum, yeah, is not discussed.
Rule number two.
Anything, right, that your superior officer says to you or any of your other fucking superior officers say to you, yeah?
Not discussed!
Rule number three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, I don't care.
For the rest of your fucking miserable measly lives, yeah?
Because I, like you, am also a complete fucking sodomite.
Jewish women.
You do not go anywhere near them because Jewish women for you are off the fucking menu.
I think that's fair.
Hmm.
Hmm.
All right, that's it, yeah.
Forgive me, I interrupted you.
Pick him up.
Get them out of here and make this fucking work.
Don't fucking wait!
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!
You're a fucking disgrace!
Go!
You've got a key?
I kept a spare.
Give it to me.
Could do with some paint, eh?
Yeah, when I decide.
What is it that you want, Tommy?
Just came by to say hello.
Tommy Shelby never goes anywhere for no reason.
Fine.
I've got 800 pounds left in the Shelby property fund, and I need someone down here to look for suitable properties.
To rent?
Yes.
To poor people.
Ten to a room.
No repairs, no water.
And if they complain, you just send Arthur and the boys round.
You know, I give advice down at the library.
Families thrown on the street.
It's men like you we're fighting.
Well, anyway, I was just passing.
Thanks for the tea.
Tommy.
There are always men outside watching the house.
Yeah.
Gangsters of the worst kind.
But they're there to keep you safe.
No there are others.
They look like coppers.
Well, they're on your side as well.
I don't have a fucking side.
Ada, yes, you do.
And, anyway, if I thought there was no-one watching the house,
I couldn't sleep.
Cheerio then.
That was great.
Well done.
Out we get then.
This house is mine.
I've taken on a maid.
She's made up the big room for you.
Come on, let's have a look.
I thought we could spend the week here.
You know, get to know each other again.
I've got ham.
Do you like ham?
I like ham, yes.
- I've got a maid...
- Yes, you said.
She's upstairs.
She can give us some tea.
Look, I ring this bell.
Watch.
Yes, madam?
I think we'd like some tea.
You get used to it.
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.
I'm not a cleaner.
But I have come to clean away some dirt.
Why don't you put that away before it goes off?
You killed my son!
You Peaky bastard!
You beat him and beat him and beat him.
Your son was a boxer.
No!
He was a boy who got into a ring with an animal.
Yeah, ain't that the truth.
I've come to stop you because the coppers and nobody else will.
If you're going to use it, point that thing at my head.
That's where the trouble is.
Gut-shot soldiers take half a day to die.
I've seen 'em.
Walking around with their guts in their arms like dirty washing.
Hold that gun up and do it!
Fucking do it!
Do it!
I'm going to finish my drink.
You can finish it with me, if you like.
Now, look.
Look at me.
We've got a fund.
For you.
You'll get paid weekly.
I know it won't bring back your son.
I know that.
You have other sons.
You do.
And we'll find them work.
And you won't have to work.
You'll be...
Somebody has got to stop you people.
Who broke the fucking mirror?
Seven years' bad luck, that is.
There'll be another four boatloads tomorrow.
What's up, Charlie?
Business is good.
This isn't business, this is bloody work.
Cigarettes and booze is all right, but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.
I'm not even sure it's stolen.
Some of it is legally purchased.
One day, all of it will be.
It's like having a fucking job.
Hey!
Easy with them fan belts.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.
Done.
You don't even fight me any more.
And it's no sport getting through the Black Country with this truce.
They just fucking wave at you from the bank.
Well, just wave back, eh?
And all these fucking cars.
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?
Uh.
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.
Major Campbell.
Beg pardon?
It doesn't matter.
Are there any other Irishmen lodging in this house?
No, Mr Campbell, I keep a respectable house.
With your special exception, I have no Irish here.
Well, let me know if any come enquiring after rooms.
Even if you turn them away, let me know, would you?
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.
They only said you was a policeman of some sort.
No.
I'm not expecting any trouble.
Is there a cafe nearby that serves chops?
Lamb or pork?
There is a chophouse two streets away.
But I myself serve sandwiches.
Egg and cress, or ham.
Or anything that pleases you.
No.
No.
No.
I, I think I'll go out and get some air.
Our scheduled meeting is not until Sunday.
I decided to bring it forward.
You just wanted to show me that you know where I live, isn't that it?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
You know, Mr Churchill was impressed.
Yes, he was.
All my demands have been met.
Did he tell you?
Yes.
Yes.
We had a meeting and your letter was read aloud.
As a matter of fact, there was quite a lot of hilarity at the meeting.
The gentlemen all found it quite funny.
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the gentlemen sometimes find you funny?
We will discuss our business on Sunday, on the agreed day, at the allotted time, and at the place that has already been determined.
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.
There was another reason I came to see you tonight.
I just didn't want you to be made a fool of, is all.
The lodgings chosen for you by the police department, how shall I put this?
Well, your landlady used to run the most famous whorehouse in Stechford.
She's only semi-retired.
I bet the gentlemen would find that funny, eh?
Told to you in the spirit of friendship and co-operation.
See you Sunday!
- Name?
- Digbeth Kid.
Your real name.
Harold Hancox.
Profession?
Illegal bookmaker.
You don't admit that.
You say something like, "Umbrella mender".
And then we decide you're lying and then we arrest you.
Umbrella mender.
You were found in possession of betting slips, race cards and ticker tape.
Any explanation?
No.
No.
"No.
I have no explanation for my possession of those items, officer."
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.
Come on, son.
Bloody hellfire.
You've killed him, huh?
As I've explained, he's not easy to get at.
He's got an army round him.
But when the time is right...
The time is right.
It's right now.
When he's away from his familiar territory, I will take him.
- So what do you want?
- We heard from a guard at Winson Green prison that one of their bookies has just been put inside.
Kid called Harold Hancox.
We could make a point.
How many bakers is there in Camden Town now?
There are a lot of bakers in Camden Town, Mr Sabini, but, as I have said, we don't as yet have a definite number.
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?
Ragman.
- Where's my dry cleaning?
- It's been collected.
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?
- What?
You don't know?
- I can find out.
No need.
I know already.
You see, the favourites, they're all winning.
And the second favourites are being done.
He's bewitching them.
Bewitching?
Gypsy stuff.
Herbs, potions.
And he's tipping off our big punters, so they know who's going to win.
Regular customers betraying us for profit.
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see,
comes before race, creed, family.
Results look normal to me.
You see shit!
Mr Sabini, if you think they're planning to fix Northern races, we'll take no more bets on anything north of Towcester.
- I gave you a job already.
- And the job will be done.
- But meantime...
- Meantime, fuck!
Meantime, what do you want us to do about the kid in the cage in Birmingham?
Why would you want me to say that out loud?
Is there somebody listening?
All right, I'll say it.
We'll kill the Hancox kid to send a message.
Good, and then you deal with Tommy fucking Shelby.
You wanted to see me?
Aye.
Take off your clothes.
I know what you are.
So, take off your clothes.
Not done in a very gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.
Indeed not.
So it's true.
Stop.
I only wanted proof.
Not satisfaction.
Or indeed infection.
Are you in on the joke?
What joke?
I have unfinished business in this filthy city.
And when the time comes, I will finish that business.
And then my wrath will come down on all of youse.
But now, tell your friends in the police station that I know.
And when my judgement comes,
I'll be the one that's laughing.
Get out.
On the right.
On the right.
We haven't got all night.
Come on!
Let's be having you, Watkins, in there on the right.
On the right!
Come on, boys!
Harold Hancox?
Tell everybody, this is what happens to Blinders who come into the Green from now on.
Orders of Sabini.
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not a Blinder.
I've been stood up.
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
This had better be good to interrupt my holiday.
Where's the boy?
In the back room.
I only brought him because afterwards we're going to the museum.
- He wanted to come in and say hello...
- Shut up, John.
There is nothing of interest to Michael in this room.
Tommy, get on with it.
Last night, one of our men had his throat cut in Winson Green.
This morning, I had a telegram saying it was Sabini who ordered it.
And it says here that Thomas Shelby's next.
If our men think we can't look after them in prison, they'll not work for us.
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.
Scudboat, you and one of the boys break a couple of windows, get yourselves arrested.
I'll have our coppers get you into the Green and you can find the bastards who did it.
Instead of breaking a window, can we pinch a car?
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.
I'm still on a donkey.
All right, just get yourselves fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.
And before you all laugh, a boy is dead.
He was just a kid.
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.
Agreed.
So is that it?
Can I go now?
Well, as company treasurer,
I need your permission to spend 1,000 guineas.
On what?
On a horse.
A thousand guineas on a horse?
That's right.
When was this decided?
You've been busy with Michael.
Oh, my God.
So, in the absence of common sense, you boys have had an idea.
Polly, there's a thoroughbred, quarter-Arab filly up for auction at the Doncaster Bloodstock.
What do we want with a 1,000-guinea horse?
When we make our move on Sabini's racing pitches, any men we get into the betting enclosure will be lifted by Sabini's police.
A good racehorse is a passport to the owner's enclosure.
We'll be in there with all the toffs.
- Coppers won't know where to look.
- Hmm.
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.
We'll be drinking with the bloody king.
The Derby?
Did he say the Derby?
That's right.
For the last 10 years, Sabini's made it his race.
If we're going to take him down, might as well make it there, as a symbol.
Did you come up with this idea in a pub by any chance?
Pol.
A good racehorse is an investment, like property.
We need to diversify the portfolio.
So when is this sale?
Tomorrow.
Tommy's had a death threat, so we'll have to go with him for protection.
So, you're going to close up the shop, go out on a piss-up and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse that's not even whole Arab.
Quarter-Arab is better!
- Quarter-Arab, it means...
- Curly, shut up.
I thought I told you to lock that door.
He did.
I used the key on the nail.
Look, I've been listening.
- I want to go with them.
- You see?
I love horses.
I could even help.
Over my dead body!
It'll be all right, Mum.
I've been to loads of horse auctions before with my uncle.
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.
Yeah, and their posh wives!
And their mistresses.
Let him come, Polly.
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.
I'll drop him back at the house in Sutton before it gets dark.
No.
Fucking no!
All right, that's it.
Back to work.
Come on!
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,
I'd killed 100 men and seen 1,000 die.
If you want to scare that kid away forever, carry on how you're going.
If you want him to stay, let him come.
I can't believe it.
All John's old things fit me.
Christ, you look like your father.
Shrimp, ham.
What was he like?
My dad?
How did he die?
Well, I won't lie to you.
He died drunk, squeezed between a boat and a lock.
A real river gypsy's death.
But he could sing, play the piano...
His smile would break your heart.
You've got his same beautiful eyes.
When he was sober, he was kind and gentle.
His trouble was, he fell in with the wrong crowd when he was a boy.
I have told them not to blow that horn.
This is a respectable fucking neighbourhood!
- She's heating up, Curly.
Take a look.
- Yeah.
Let me out for a piss.
She made loads.
Do you want one?
What the bloody hell's that?
Sandwiches.
Ham, I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.
There's tea, but we'll have to take turns 'cause there's only one cup.
What?
Sandwiches?
- Yeah.
- Polly made bloody sandwiches?
What's this?
Teddy bear's fucking picnic?
All right.
We will drink the tea and we will eat the sandwiches and then we will drive on.
All right?
No crumbs, Charlie.
- Hand them over.
- Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard.
- Fuck off.
- John, come on!
All right, lads, this is a respectable event and we will all behave accordingly.
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.
When the horse comes up, I will do the bidding.
I've already registered my interest with the auctioneer.
So he knows to expect my bids.
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.
It's all right, Curly.
You're just in an unfamiliar place, we all are.
- I get feelings sometimes, Tommy.
- It's all right, Curly.
It's all right.
- Shut up, Curly.
- Do I hear 1,450?
Do I hear 500, 500, 1,600, 1,700?
Thank you.
1,900, 2,000, 2,100, 2,200...
Why do people come late to these things?
Hmm?
People come late 'cause they know what they want.
It's only you who needs to see every horse.
Am I bid?
2,600.
I am bid!
Sold!
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud, by Tetrarch out of Lady Josephine.
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.
All right, Tommy, this is her.
Do I hear 800 guineas?
850?
850.
Do I hear nine?
Do I hear nine?
Nine, am I bid?
Bid for this one.
The grey?
Why?
- He's beautiful.
- It's a filly.
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.
1,000.
Do I hear 1,050?
1,100?
1,200?
Do I hear 250?
250.
I'll go halves with you from the spring fund.
Go, go.
1,300?
1,400?
Do I hear five?
1,500.
1,600.
Do I hear seven?
1,700.
Thank you.
That's it, Tom, you have to stop.
You don't have it in your belt.
Yes, I do.
I'm having the horse.
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But, stop, I tell you.
- I feel something bad!
- Shut up, Curly!
2,000.
Do I hear 2,050?
2,050.
Am I bid?
- 2,050...
- Enough!
Billy could use one of my geldings.
2,000, I am bid.
Do I hear 2,050?
Last time.
2,050?
Sold!
To Mr...
Thomas Shelby.
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,
Small Heath.
- What kind of premises?
- Boat yard.
Yachts?
Canals.
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?
Import, export.
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes.
You beat us to it.
Did I?
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.
- Sorry.
- Thomas Shelby from where?
From Birmingham.
Goodness!
No, not much.
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.
What is it you do?
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!
Well, before you go, if you ever decide to put that filly out,
- I'd be interested in having her.
- I plan to race her.
- Do you have a trainer?
- I know people.
- I know people, too.
- Tommy!
We've got to get this kid back before dark or Polly will have your balls!
She will have 'em!
We know different people, I would guess.
My father knows Mick Hancock.
- Trained three Ascot winners.
- Oh, so that was your father?
Yes.
We're joint-owners of the stud.
He took the majority share when my husband was killed.
Ypres.
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!
The chickens are hungry!
So will you consider me?
I will consider you.
You still didn't tell me what you do.
Oh!
I do bad things.
But you already know that.
Right, about bloody time!
It's the fucking truth, John boy.
Rich women these days, all they want is working-class cock.
Tommy, maybe she was the something bad I had the feeling about!
Ah!
She looks all right to me, Curly!
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.
Yeah, by us.
All I'll say is she has good contacts in the racing world.
Here, Michael, you drive.
Thomas Shelby?
Tommy!
Tommy!
Down!
Tommy Shelby?
How about fucking Arthur?
Fucking good to meet you.
Get him off him!
Arthur!
Arthur!
Get him off him!
Come on.
Stop it, Arthur.
Get him off.
Arthur, that's enough.
Arthur, come on!
Come on, Arthur, come on.
That's it.
It's over.
Arthur!
Come on, shut up.
Come on, come on.
He's still breathing.
Don't get blood on the kid!
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?
Give me the keys.
Michael, give me the keys.
I'm all right to drive.
All right.
Go on.
Go on, go on!
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!
- Right, let's get out of here, sharpish.
- Come on!
So?
How'd it go?
Well, it was cold in the van, but it was super.
Really.
Let me smell your breath.
Did they behave themselves?
They were amazing, Mum.
They were really amazing.
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs have been at war in London.
The Jews have been having the worst of it.
They need allies.
Tell us your plan.
I can offer you 100 good men.
Get him out of there, get him back!
Arthur killed a boy.
Polly, these are the files for Michael and Anna Gray.
Your daughter is dead.
But, Pol, Michael is alive.
I'm looking for someone called Elizabeth Gray.
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?
I think she might be my mother.
There's an old friend of ours coming back to the city.
He's head of some secret department, the Irish Desk.
Ripped By mstoll
He was murdered this morning in a street show in the Patch.
He was Irish.
Is he a person of interest to your department, sir?
Do you read the papers?
Birmingham papers.
I recommend the Daily Mail.
It will broaden your mind.
Now, if you read the national press, you would know that the king has offered the rebel Irish a treaty.
Now, some of the Fenians want to accept it.
The IRA do not.
Now, the IRA have a long and glorious relationship with the garrotte.
Oh, dear.
Are they fighting amongst themselves, are they, sir?
- That will be all.
-Right, sir.
Oh, Moss, I'm going to be up and down from London quite a bit.
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?
Well, you wouldn't want to stay in the lodgings you had last time then, sir, eh?
Too many bad memories, I suppose.
You should understand, Moss,
I have no regrets about my previous mission in this city.
No, sir?
I imagine you boys have quite a laugh at my expense.
A laugh, sir?
You think it's funny that I developed feelings?
No idea what you're talking about, sir.
I have no regrets about what happened with Miss Burgess.
No "bad memories".
Right, sir.
He's losing his bloody mind.
Next.
Next.
All right, then.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
The Dig...
What are you?
A boxer?
Digbeth Kid like Billy the Kid.
Spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?
Cowboy pictures?
Tom Mix?
Yeah?
What are you...
Wait, wait.
It's not a real gun.
- Let's have a look then, eh?
-It's made of wood.
Bang.Bang.
Very nice.
Where did you get the gun belt?
My sister made it out of an old blacksmith's apron.
My mum did most of the stitching.
She's not my real mum, but...
She does what mothers do.
So she made you a gun belt.
All right then, mother's boy.
There's the door.
On you go.
We're looking for...
Have you ever been arrested?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- No.
-Good.
You're the first bloke we've had in here today with no criminal record.
Arthur, we can stand him up.
Do you know what that means?
The new Home Secretary wants something done about illegal gambling.
Damn right.
About bloody time.
So we help our coppers make their quota of convictions by having men stood up to be arrested.
First offence, you'll get a week inside.
We'll give you five quid for your trouble.
How does that sound, cowboy?
Yeah.
Good.
Write your address down for Finn on your way out.
I can't write.
That's all right, Finn can't read.
Don't worry.
Just tell him your address and we'll send someone round.
If the sheriff don't run you out of town first.
Good man.
- Oh, I don't know, Tom.
Kids these days.
-Hmm.
They didn't fight.
So they're different.
They stay kids.
How was it?
I was starving, so I would have eaten anything.
But really it was super.
Super.
So, uh, are you a cook?
Not a cook.
No.
The man who came to the house, he was driving a posh car.
He looks rich.
What does he do?
- He works with horses.
-Really?
I love horses.
- I've got a bay mare.
-No!
I ride it all the time.
Then it's in the blood.
I've got about a million questions.
So do I.
I've had different pictures in my head.
Well, here I am.
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?
I don't have any choice.
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?
We don't choose.
And that's it.
Yeah, that's right.
God gave you to me.
People took you away.
And it is all right that it's me, isn't it?
In a place like this.
I thought it would be worse.
Run for the hills!
It's the Digbeth Kid!
Get out of town, kid, or I will shoot your fucking head off!
Time's up!
- You're dead, go down.
- John!
All right then, Polly.
Who's this?
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.
Pleased to meet you.
John.
I'm Arthur.
You've already met me.
I used to throw you out of the window, so John could catch you.
I used to put you in a shoebox and kick you down Watery Lane.
I bet you're glad to be back.
I don't remember any of it.
All I remember is the day they took me away.
Well, you're here now, son.
Welcome to the Shelby family.
Later on, we'll show you the ropes.
Hmm.
Yeah, we'll show you what's what.
Let's leave him be for now, eh?
Come on, boys.
- Nice suit.
They seem nice.
Here he is, Mr Inconspicuous.
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.
How are you feeling?
I've just come out of bandages myself.
Ready for active service.
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.
It's all right, Bill.
You don't have to stand in line for us.
It's men like you we're looking for, Billy.
But you have to pass the medical first.
Sheffield mob showed up at Wincanton trotting track.
I took a bullet.
When do the bandages come off?
When I take 'em off.
One week.
Not before.
You'll smell no rot.
There's no gangrene.
It's been a long time.
Eh, Billy?
What did you do with your medals?
Threw them in the cut.
Same as you.
It was never a hardship having you Black Country boys on our left flank.
And you Brummies did all right on our right.
Damn right.
I want you to be the head of a brigade, Bill.
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.
You'll have 100 men under your command.
And now we've got a member of the Kitchen family on the payroll, maybe your cousins and brothers will let our boats pass through the Black Country without being held up and robbed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Go home, Bill.
Round up any good men you can trust and put the word out.
Black Country boys and Brummie boys are on the same side again.
That'll be the bloody day.
Well, this is the bloody day.
London, man.
There for the taking.
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.
Polly said you had one in the pub.
All right, be quick.
I have business.
Sir.
Polly said you own this place.
She said you own lots of different businesses.
You call her Polly or Mum?
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.
Who are you calling?
My mother.
I mean...
I know what you mean.
And what are you going to tell her?
I'm going to tell her where I am.
And now you're going to tell her you're going home.
Polly said I could stay for a few days.
- You want to stay?
- I've only just arrived.
What age are you Michael?
Seventeen.
Seventeen.
Which means it's not up to you, right?
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.
You smoke?
No.
Drink?
You're going to call your mother, going to tell her you're getting the next train home.
And when you get there, you're going to write a letter to Polly saying when you're 18, you'll come back here and sort things out.
I just told you.
I make up my own mind.
Do you know what we do, Michael?
We, Shelbys.
Yes.
I think I know what you do.
Yeah.
You've got smart eyes.
But you're young, so you think what we do is all right.
It's not all right.
People get hurt.
Now, call your mother and I will drive you to the station.
No.
In my village, there's this little wishing well.
It's made of white bricks, right in the middle of the village green.
Everybody says how pretty it is.
But I swear to God, if I spend another day in that village,
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.
Probably blow my hands off with it, but it'd be worth it.
Just to see all those pretty white bricks spread over the pretty village green.
Hmm.
Yep.
You're Polly's son, all right.
All right boys, let's go to work.
Let's be having it!
Don't wait!
Keep it moving.
Move!
Next lad!
Name?
Abbey Heath.
Abbey Heath.
Profession?
Baker.
Good lad.
Fill it out and fuck off.
Next lad!
Name?
Buddy Halls.
Buddy Halls.
Right.
Profession?
Baker.
Good lad.
Fill it out and fuck off.
Next lad!
- Name?
-Billy Kitchen.
Billy Kitchen.
Occupation?
Head baker.
Fill it out.
Um, Tommy Shelby, mate.
Never give power to the big man, what did I tell you?
Hmm?
Never give power to the big man.
Next lad!
Name?
All right, boys, you've now all been enrolled as bakers in the Aerated Bread Company of Camden Town.
If anyone asks, that's what you do.
You're bakers.
The coppers in Camden Town are on our side, but north or south, you show them that piece of paper.
Tell them you've come down from north to find work, to break strikes.
Tell them you're fascists, if you have to.
We're finding lodgings for you, but for now you'll sleep here in the bakery.
But don't touch any of the bread, it'll most likely explode.
Any questions?
Yes?
I haven't even seen any bread.
He'll wake up.
Granted, he won't have any teeth left, but he will be a wiser man for it.
And the last thing he will remember is your funny little joke.
Won't he?
Right!
There are fucking rules here.
Yeah, there are fucking rules for a fucking reason.
Quite simply, they have to be obeyed.
All right?
Rule number one.
The distinction between bread and rum, yeah, is not discussed.
Rule number two.
Anything, right, that your superior officer says to you or any of your other fucking superior officers say to you, yeah?
Not discussed!
Rule number three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, I don't care.
For the rest of your fucking miserable measly lives, yeah?
Because I, like you, am also a complete fucking sodomite.
Jewish women.
You do not go anywhere near them because Jewish women for you are off the fucking menu.
I think that's fair.
Hmm.
Hmm.
All right, that's it, yeah.
Forgive me, I interrupted you.
Pick him up.
Get them out of here and make this fucking work.
Don't fucking wait!
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!
You're a fucking disgrace!
Go!
You've got a key?
I kept a spare.
Give it to me.
Could do with some paint, eh?
Yeah, when I decide.
What is it that you want, Tommy?
Just came by to say hello.
Tommy Shelby never goes anywhere for no reason.
Fine.
I've got 800 pounds left in the Shelby property fund, and I need someone down here to look for suitable properties.
To rent?
Yes.
To poor people.
Ten to a room.
No repairs, no water.
And if they complain, you just send Arthur and the boys round.
You know, I give advice down at the library.
Families thrown on the street.
It's men like you we're fighting.
Well, anyway, I was just passing.
Thanks for the tea.
Tommy.
There are always men outside watching the house.
Yeah.
Gangsters of the worst kind.
But they're there to keep you safe.
No there are others.
They look like coppers.
Well, they're on your side as well.
I don't have a fucking side.
Ada, yes, you do.
And, anyway, if I thought there was no-one watching the house,
I couldn't sleep.
Cheerio then.
That was great.
Well done.
Out we get then.
This house is mine.
I've taken on a maid.
She's made up the big room for you.
Come on, let's have a look.
I thought we could spend the week here.
You know, get to know each other again.
I've got ham.
Do you like ham?
I like ham, yes.
- I've got a maid...
-Yes, you said.
She's upstairs.
She can give us some tea.
Look, I ring this bell.
Watch.
Yes, madam?
I think we'd like some tea.
You get used to it.
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.
I'm not a cleaner.
But I have come to clean away some dirt.
Why don't you put that away before it goes off?
You killed my son!
You Peaky bastard!
You beat him and beat him and beat him.
Your son was a boxer.
No!
He was a boy who got into a ring with an animal.
Yeah, ain't that the truth.
I've come to stop you because the coppers and nobody else will.
If you're going to use it, point that thing at my head.
That's where the trouble is.
Gut-shot soldiers take half a day to die.
I've seen 'em.
Walking around with their guts in their arms like dirty washing.
Hold that gun up and do it!
Fucking do it!
Do it!
I'm going to finish my drink.
You can finish it with me, if you like.
Now, look.
Look at me.
We've got a fund.
For you.
You'll get paid weekly.
I know it won't bring back your son.
I know that.
You have other sons.
You do.
And we'll find them work.
And you won't have to work.
- You'll be...
Somebody has got to stop you people.
Who broke the fucking mirror?
Seven years' bad luck, that is.
There'll be another four boatloads tomorrow.
What's up, Charlie?
Business is good.
This isn't business, this is bloody work.
Cigarettes and booze is all right, but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.
I'm not even sure it's stolen.
Some of it is legally purchased.
One day, all of it will be.
It's like having a fucking job.
Hey!
Easy with them fan belts.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.
Done.
You don't even fight me any more.
And it's no sport getting through the Black Country with this truce.
They just fucking wave at you from the bank.
Well, just wave back, eh?
And all these fucking cars.
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?
--Uh.
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.
Major Campbell.
Beg pardon?
It doesn't matter.
Are there any other Irishmen lodging in this house?
No, Mr Campbell, I keep a respectable house.
With your special exception, I have no Irish here.
Well, let me know if any come enquiring after rooms.
Even if you turn them away, let me know, would you?
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.
They only said you was a policeman of some sort.
No.
I'm not expecting any trouble.
Is there a cafe nearby that serves chops?
Lamb or pork?
There is a chophouse two streets away.
But I myself serve sandwiches.
Egg and cress, or ham.
Or anything that pleases you.
No.
No.
No.
I, I think I'll go out and get some air.
Our scheduled meeting is not until Sunday.
I decided to bring it forward.
You just wanted to show me that you know where I live, isn't that it?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
You know, Mr Churchill was impressed.
Yes, he was.
All my demands have been met.
Did he tell you?
Yes.
Yes.
We had a meeting and your letter was read aloud.
As a matter of fact, there was quite a lot of hilarity at the meeting.
- The gentlemen all found it quite funny.
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the gentlemen sometimes find you funny?
We will discuss our business on Sunday, on the agreed day, at the allotted time, and at the place that has already been determined.
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.
There was another reason I came to see you tonight.
I just didn't want you to be made a fool of, is all.
The lodgings chosen for you by the police department, how shall I put this?
Well, your landlady used to run the most famous whorehouse in Stechford.
She's only semi-retired.
I bet the gentlemen would find that funny, eh?
Told to you in the spirit of friendship and co-operation.
See you Sunday!
- Name?
-Digbeth Kid.
Your real name.
Harold Hancox.
Profession?
Illegal bookmaker.
You don't admit that.
You say something like, "Umbrella mender".
And then we decide you're lying and then we arrest you.
Umbrella mender.
You were found in possession of betting slips, race cards and ticker tape.
Any explanation?
No.
No.
"No.
"I have no explanation
"for my possession of those items, officer."
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.
Come on, son.
Bloody hellfire.
You've killed him, huh?
As I've explained, he's not easy to get at.
He's got an army round him.
But when the time is right...
The time is right.
It's right now.
When he's away from his familiar territory, I will take him.
- So what do you want?
-We heard from a guard at Winson Green prison that one of their bookies has just been put inside.
Kid called Harold Hancox.
We could make a point.
How many bakers is there in Camden Town now?
There are a lot of bakers in Camden Town, Mr Sabini, but, as I have said, we don't as yet have a definite number.
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?
Ragman.
- Where's my dry cleaning?
-It's been collected.
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?
- What?
You don't know?
-I can find out.
No need.
I know already.
You see, the favourites, they're all winning.
And the second favourites are being done.
He's bewitching them.
Bewitching?
Gypsy stuff.
Herbs, potions.
And he's tipping off our big punters, so they know who's going to win.
Regular customers betraying us for profit.
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see,
comes before race, creed, family.
Results look normal to me.
You see shit!
Mr Sabini, if you think they're planning to fix Northern races, we'll take no more bets on anything north of Towcester.
- I gave you a job already.
-And the job will be done.
- But meantime...
-Meantime, fuck!
Meantime, what do you want us to do about the kid in the cage in Birmingham?
Why would you want me to say that out loud?
Is there somebody listening?
All right, I'll say it.
We'll kill the Hancox kid to send a message.
Good, and then you deal with Tommy fucking Shelby.
You wanted to see me?
Aye.
Take off your clothes.
I know what you are.
So, take off your clothes.
Not done in a very gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.
Indeed not.
So it's true.
Stop.
I only wanted proof.
Not satisfaction.
Or indeed infection.
Are you in on the joke?
What joke?
I have unfinished business in this filthy city.
And when the time comes, I will finish that business.
And then my wrath will come down on all of youse.
--But now, tell your friends in the police station that I know.
And when my judgement comes,
I'll be the one that's laughing.
Get out.
On the right.
On the right.
We haven't got all night.
Come on!
Let's be having you, Watkins, in there on the right.
On the right!
Come on, boys!
Harold Hancox?
Tell everybody, this is what happens to Blinders who come into the Green from now on.
Orders of Sabini.
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not a Blinder.
I've been stood up.
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
This had better be good to interrupt my holiday.
Where's the boy?
In the back room.
I only brought him because afterwards we're going to the museum.
- He wanted to come in and say hello...
-Shut up, John.
There is nothing of interest to Michael in this room.
Tommy, get on with it.
Last night, one of our men had his throat cut in Winson Green.
This morning, I had a telegram saying it was Sabini who ordered it.
And it says here that Thomas Shelby's next.
If our men think we can't look after them in prison, they'll not work for us.
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.
Scudboat, you and one of the boys break a couple of windows, get yourselves arrested.
I'll have our coppers get you into the Green and you can find the bastards who did it.
Instead of breaking a window, can we pinch a car?
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.
- I'm still on a donkey.
All right, just get yourselves fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.
And before you all laugh, a boy is dead.
He was just a kid.
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.
Agreed.
So is that it?
Can I go now?
Well, as company treasurer,
I need your permission to spend 1,000 guineas.
On what?
On a horse.
A thousand guineas on a horse?
That's right.
When was this decided?
You've been busy with Michael.
Oh, my God.
So, in the absence of common sense, you boys have had an idea.
Polly, there's a thoroughbred, quarter-Arab filly up for auction at the Doncaster Bloodstock.
What do we want with a 1,000-guinea horse?
When we make our move on Sabini's racing pitches, any men we get into the betting enclosure will be lifted by Sabini's police.
A good racehorse is a passport to the owner's enclosure.
We'll be in there with all the toffs.
- Coppers won't know where to look.
-Hmm.
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.
We'll be drinking with the bloody king.
The Derby?
Did he say the Derby?
That's right.
For the last 10 years, Sabini's made it his race.
If we're going to take him down, might as well make it there, as a symbol.
Did you come up with this idea in a pub by any chance?
Pol.
A good racehorse is an investment, like property.
We need to diversify the portfolio.
So when is this sale?
Tomorrow.
Tommy's had a death threat, so we'll have to go with him for protection.
So, you're going to close up the shop, go out on a piss-up and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse that's not even whole Arab.
Quarter-Arab is better!
- Quarter-Arab, it means...
-Curly, shut up.
I thought I told you to lock that door.
He did.
I used the key on the nail.
Look, I've been listening.
- I want to go with them.
-You see?
I love horses.
I could even help.
Over my dead body!
It'll be all right, Mum.
I've been to loads of horse auctions before with my uncle.
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.
Yeah, and their posh wives!
And their mistresses.
Let him come, Polly.
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.
I'll drop him back at the house in Sutton before it gets dark.
No.
Fucking no!
All right, that's it.
Back to work.
Come on!
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,
I'd killed 100 men and seen 1,000 die.
If you want to scare that kid away forever, carry on how you're going.
If you want him to stay, let him come.
I can't believe it.
All John's old things fit me.
Christ, you look like your father.
Shrimp, ham.
What was he like?
My dad?
How did he die?
Well, I won't lie to you.
He died drunk, squeezed between a boat and a lock.
A real river gypsy's death.
But he could sing, play the piano...
His smile would break your heart.
You've got his same beautiful eyes.
When he was sober, he was kind and gentle.
His trouble was, he fell in with the wrong crowd when he was a boy.
I have told them not to blow that horn.
This is a respectable fucking neighbourhood!
- She's heating up, Curly.
Take a look.
-Yeah.
Let me out for a piss.
She made loads.
Do you want one?
What the bloody hell's that?
Sandwiches.
Ham, I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.
There's tea, but we'll have to take turns 'cause there's only one cup.
What?
Sandwiches?
- Yeah.
-Polly made bloody sandwiches?
What's this?
Teddy bear's fucking picnic?
All right.
We will drink the tea and we will eat the sandwiches and then we will drive on.
All right?
No crumbs, Charlie.
- Hand them over.
- Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard.
- Fuck off.
- John, come on!
All right, lads, this is a respectable event and we will all behave accordingly.
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.
When the horse comes up, I will do the bidding.
I've already registered my interest with the auctioneer.
So he knows to expect my bids.
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.
It's all right, Curly.
You're just in an unfamiliar place, we all are.
- I get feelings sometimes, Tommy.
-It's all right, Curly.
It's all right.
- Shut up, Curly.
- Do I hear 1,450?
Do I hear 500, 500, 1,600, 1,700?
Thank you.
1,900, 2,000, 2,100, 2,200..
Why do people come late to these things?
Hmm?
People come late 'cause they know what they want.
It's only you who needs to see every horse.
Am I bid?
2,600.
I am bid!
Sold!
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud, by Tetrarch out of Lady Josephine.
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.
All right, Tommy, this is her.
Do I hear 800 guineas?
850?
850.
Do I hear nine?
Do I hear nine?
Nine, am I bid?
Bid for this one.
The grey?
Why?
- He's beautiful.
-It's a filly.
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.
1,000.
Do I hear 1,050?
1,100?
1,200?
Do I hear 250?
250.
I'll go halves with you from the spring fund.
Go, go.
1,300?
1,400?
Do I hear five?
1,500.
1,600.
Do I hear seven?
1,700.
Thank you.
That's it, Tom, you have to stop.
You don't have it in your belt.
Yes, I do.
I'm having the horse.
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But, stop, I tell you.
- I feel something bad!
-Shut up, Curly!
2,000.
Do I hear 2,050?
2,050.
Am I bid?
-2,050...
-Enough!
Billy could use one of my geldings.
2,000, I am bid.
Do I hear 2,050?
Last time.
2,050?
Sold!
To Mr...
Thomas Shelby.
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,
Small Heath.
- What kind of premises?
-Boat yard.
Yachts?
Canals.
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?
Import, export.
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes.
You beat us to it.
Did I?
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.
- Sorry.
-Thomas Shelby from where?
From Birmingham.
Goodness!
No, not much.
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.
What is it you do?
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!
Well, before you go, if you ever decide to put that filly out,
- I'd be interested in having her.
-I plan to race her.
- Do you have a trainer?
-I know people.
- I know people, too.
-Tommy!
We've got to get this kid back before dark or Polly will have your balls!
She will have 'em!
We know different people, I would guess.
My father knows Mick Hancock.
- Trained three Ascot winners.
-Oh, so that was your father?
Yes.
We're joint-owners of the stud.
He took the majority share when my husband was killed.
Ypres.
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!
The chickens are hungry!
So will you consider me?
I will consider you.
You still didn't tell me what you do.
Oh!
I do bad things.
But you already know that.
Right, about bloody time!
It's the fucking truth, John boy.
Rich women these days, all they want is working-class cock.
Tommy, maybe she was the something bad I had the feeling about!
Ah!
She looks all right to me, Curly!
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.
Yeah, by us.
All I'll say is she has good contacts in the racing world.
Here, Michael, you drive.
Thomas Shelby?
- Tommy!
- Tommy!
Down!
Tommy Shelby?
How about fucking Arthur?
Fucking good to meet you.
Get him off him!
Arthur!
Arthur!
Get him off him!
Come on.
Stop it, Arthur.
Get him off.
Arthur, that's enough.
Arthur, come on!
Come on, Arthur, come on.
That's it.
It's over.
Arthur!
Come on, shut up.
Come on, come on.
He's still breathing.
Don't get blood on the kid!
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?
Give me the keys.
Michael, give me the keys.
I'm all right to drive.
All right.
Go on.
Go on, go on!
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!
- Right, let's get out of here, sharpish.
-Come on!
So?
How'd it go?
Well, it was cold in the van, but it was super.
Really.
Let me smell your breath.
Did they behave themselves?
They were amazing, Mum.
They were really amazing.
Ripped By mstoll
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs have been at war in London.
The Jews have been having the worst of it.
They need allies.
Tell us your plan.
I can offer you 100 good men.
Get him out of there, get him back!
Arthur killed a boy.
Polly, these are the files for Michael and Anna Gray.
Your daughter is dead.
But Pol...
Michael is alive.
I'm looking for someone called Elizabeth Gray.
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?
I think she might be my mother.
An old friend of ours is coming back to the city.
He's head of some secret department... the Irish desk.
♪ Take a little walk to the edge of town
♪ Go across the tracks
♪ Where the viaduct looms
♪ Like a bird of doom
♪ As it shifts and cracks
♪ Where secrets lie
♪ In the border fires
♪ In the humming wires
♪ And you know you're never coming back
♪ On a gathering storm comes
♪ A tall handsome man
♪ In a dusty black coat
♪ With a red right hand. ♪
He was murdered this morning in a street show in the Patch.
He was Irish.
Is he a person of interest to your department, sir?
Do you read the papers?
Birmingham papers.
I recommend the Daily Mail.
It will broaden your mind.
Now, if you read the national press, you would know that the King has offered the rebel Irish a treaty.
Some of the Fenians want to accept it.
The IRA do not.
Now, the IRA have a long and glorious relationship... with the garrotte.
Oh, dear.
Are they fighting amongst themselves, are they, sir?
~ That will be all.
~ Right, sir.
I'm going to be up and down from London quite a bit.
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?
Well, you wouldn't want to stay at the lodgings you had last time though, sir, eh?
Too many bad memories, I suppose.
You should understand, Moss,
I have no regrets about my previous mission in this city.
No, sir?
I imagine you boys have quite a laugh at my expense.
A laugh, sir?
You think it's funny that I developed feelings.
No idea what you're talking about, sir.
I have no regrets about what happened with Miss Burgess.
No "bad memories".
Right, sir.
He's losing his bloody mind.
Next.
Next.
All right then.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
The Dig...
What are you?
A boxer?
Digbeth Kid, like Billy the Kid.
Spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?
Cowboy pictures?
Tom Mix?
Yeah?
What are you...?
!
Wait, wait.
It's not a real gun.
~ Let's have a look then, eh?
~ It's made of wood.
Bang.
Bang.
Very nice.
Where did you get the gun belt?
My sister made it out of an old blacksmith's apron.
My mum did most of the stitching.
She's not my real mum but...
She does what mothers do.
So she made you a gun belt.
All right there, mother's boy.
There's the door, on you go.
We're looking for...
Have you ever been arrested?
~ Yeah.
~ Yeah?
~ No.
~ Good.
You're the first bloke we've had in here today with no criminal record.
Arthur, we can stand him up.
Do you know what that means?
The new Home Secretary wants something done about illegal gambling.
~ Damn right.
~ About bloody time.
So we help our coppers make their quota of convictions by having men stood up to be arrested.
First offence, you'll get a week inside.
We'll give you five quid for your trouble.
How does that sound, cowboy?
Yeah.
Good.
Write your address down for Finn on your way out.
I can't write.
That's all right, Finn can't read.
Don't worry.
Just tell him your address and we'll send someone round.
If the Sheriff don't run you out of town first.
Good man.
Oh, I don't know, Tom.
Kids these days.
They didn't fight.
So they're different.
They stay kids.
How was it?
I was starving so I would have eaten anything.
But, really, it was super.
Super.
So, er, are you a cook?
Not a cook, no.
The man who came to the house, he was driving a posh car, he looks rich.
What does he do?
~ He works with horses.
~ Really?
!
~ I love horses.
I've got a bay mare.
~ No!
I ride it all the time.
Then it's in the blood.
I've got about a million questions.
So do I.
I've had different pictures in my head.
Well, here I am.
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?
I don't have any choice.
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?
We don't choose.
And that's it.
Yeah, that's right.
God gave you to me.
People took you away.
And it is all right that it's me?
Isn't it?
In a place like this.
I thought it would be worse.
'Run for the hills!
'It's the Digbeth Kid!
'
Get out of town, kid, or I'll shoot your fucking head off!
Times up!
~ You're dead, go down. ~ John!
All right then, Polly.
Who's this?
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.
~ Pleased to meet you.
~ John.
I'm Arthur.
You've already met me.
I used to throw you out of the window so John could catch you.
I used to put you in a shoebox and kick you down Watery Lane.
I bet you're glad to be back.
I don't remember any of it.
All I remember is the day they took me away.
Well, you're here now, son.
Welcome to the Shelby family.
~ Later on, we'll show you the ropes.
~ Yeah, we'll show you what's what.
Let's leave him be for now, eh?
Come on, boys.
Nice suit.
They seem nice.
Here he is
- Mr Inconspicuous.
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.
How are you feeling?
I've just come out of bandages myself.
Ready for active service.
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.
It's all right, Bill.
You don't have to stand in line for us.
It's men like you we're looking for, Billy.
But you have to pass the medical first.
Sheffield mob showed up at Wincanton trotting track.
I took a bullet.
When do the bandages come off?
When I take 'em off.
One week.
Not before.
You'll smell no rot.
There's no gangrene.
It's been a long time.
Eh, Billy?
What did you do with your medals?
Threw them in the cut.
Same as you.
It was never a hardship having you Black Country boys on our left flank.
And you Brummies did all right on our right.
Damn right.
I want you to be the head of a brigade, Billy.
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.
You'll have 100 men under your command.
And now we've got a member of the Kitchen family on the payroll, maybe your cousins and brothers will let our boats pass through the Black Country without being held up and robbed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Go home, Bill.
Round up any good men you trust and put the word out.
Black Country boys and Brummie boys are on the same side again.
~ That'll be the bloody day.
~ Well, this is the bloody day.
London, man.
There for the taking.
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.
Polly said you had one in the pub.
All right, be quick.
I have business.
Sir.
Polly said you own this place.
She said you own lots of different businesses.
You call her Polly or Mum?
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.
~ Who are you calling?
~ My mother.
I mean...
I know what you mean.
And what are you going to tell her?
I'm going to tell her where I am.
And now you're going to tell her you're going home.
Polly said I could stay for a few days.
~ You want to stay?
~ I've only just arrived.
What age are you, Michael?
17.
17.
Which means it's not up to you, right?
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.
You smoke?
No.
Drink?
You're going to call your mother and tell her you're getting the next train home.
When you get there, you're going to write a letter to Polly saying when you're 18 you'll come back here and sort things out.
I just told you.
I make up my own mind.
Do you know what we do, Michael?
We...
Shelbys?
Yes.
I think I know what you do.
Yeah.
You've got smart eyes.
But you're young, so you think what we do is all right.
It's not all right.
People get hurt.
Now call your mother and I will drive you to the station.
No.
In my village, there's this little wishing well.
It's made of white bricks, right in the middle of the village green.
Everybody says how pretty it is.
But I swear to God, if I spend another day in that village,
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.
Probably blow my hands off with it but it'd be worth it.
Just to see all those pretty white bricks spread all over the pretty village green.
Yep.
You're Polly's son all right.

Right boys, let's go to work.
Let's be having it!
Don't wait!
Keep it moving.
Move!

Good lad, fill it out and fuck off.

Fill it out.
That Tommy Shelby, mate.
Never give power to the big man, what did I tell you?
Never give power to the big man.
Next lad!
Name?
All right, boys, you've now all been enrolled as bakers in the Aerated Bread Company of Camden Town.
If anyone asks, that's what you do.
You're bakers.
The coppers in Camden Town are on our side, but north or south, you show them that piece of paper.
Tell them you've come down from the north to find work, to break strikes.
Tell them you're fascists if you have to.
We're finding lodgings for you but, for now, you'll sleep here in the bakery.
But don't touch any of the bread, it'll most likely explode.
Any questions?
Yes?
I haven't seen any bread.
He'll wake up.
Granted he won't have any teeth left but he will be a wiser man for it.
And the last thing he will remember is your funny little joke.
Won't he?
Right!
There are fucking rules here.
Yeah, there are fucking rules for a fucking reason.
Quite simply they have to be obeyed.
All right?
Rule number one.
The distinction between bread and rum is not discussed.
Rule number two.
Anything, right, that your superior officer says to you or any of your other fucking superior officers say to you, yeah?
NOT DISCUSSED!
Rule number three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, I don't care.
For the rest of your fucking miserable, measly lives, yeah?
Because I, like you, am also a complete fucking sodomite.
Jewish women.
You do not go anywhere near them because Jewish women for you are off the fucking menu.
I think that's fair.
All right, that's it, yeah.
Forgive me, I interrupted.
Pick him up.
(Get them out of here and make this fucking work.)
Don't fucking wait!
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!
You're a fucking disgrace!
Go!
You've got a key?
I kept a spare.
Give it to me.
Could do with some paint, eh?
Yeah.
When I decide.
What is it that you want, Tommy?
Just came by to say hello.
Tommy Shelby never goes anywhere for no reason.
Fine.
I've got £800 left in the Shelby property fund and I need someone down here to look for suitable properties.
To rent?
Yes.
To poor people.
Ten to a room.
No repairs, no water.
And if they complain, you just send Arthur and the boys round.
I give advice down at the library.
Families thrown onto the street.
It's men like you we're fighting.
Well, anyway, I was just passing, thanks for the tea.
Tommy.
There are always men outside watching the house.
Yeah.
Gangsters of the worst kind.
But they're there to keep you safe.
No, there are others.
They look like coppers.
They're on your side as well.
~ I don't have a fucking side.
~ Ada... yes, you do.
And, anyway, if I thought there was no-one watching the house,
I couldn't sleep.
Cheerio then.
That was great, well done.
Out we get then.
This house is mine.
I've taken on a maid.
She's made up the big room for you.
Come on, let's have a look.
I thought we could spend the week here.
You know, get to know each other... again.
I've got ham.
Do you like ham?
I like ham, yes.
~ I've got a maid...
~ Yes, you said.
She's upstairs.
She can give us some tea.
Look, I ring this bell.
Watch.
Yes, madam?
I think we'd like some tea.
You get used to it.
MUSIC:
Out Of The Black by Royal Blood
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.
I'm not a cleaner.
But I have come to clean away some dirt.
Why don't you put that away before it goes off?
You killed my son, you Peaky bastard!
You beat him and beat him and beat him.
Your son was a boxer.
No!
He was a boy... who got into a ring with an animal.
Yeah, ain't that the truth.
I've come to stop you... .. because the coppers and nobody else will.
If you're going to use it, point that thing at my head.
That's where the trouble is.
Gut-shot soldiers take half a day to die.
I've seen 'em.
Walking around with their guts in their arms like dirty washing.
Hold that gun up and do it.
Well, then, do it!
Do it!
I'm going to finish my drink.
You can finish it with me if you like.
Now, look.
Look at me.
We've got a fund.
For you, you'll get paid weekly.
I know it won't bring back your son.
I know that.
And you have other sons.
You do.
And we'll find them work.
And you won't have to work.
You'll be...
Somebody has got to stop you people.
Who broke the fucking mirror?
Seven years bad luck, that is.
There'll be another four boat-loads tomorrow.
What's up, Charlie?
Business is good.
This isn't business, this is bloody work.
Cigarettes and booze is all right but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.
I'm not even sure it's stolen.
Some of it is legally purchased.
One day, all of it will be.
It's like having a fucking job.
Easy with them fan belts.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.
Done.
You don't even fight me anymore.
And it's no sport getting through the Black Country with this truce.
They just fucking wave at you from the bank.
Well, just wave back, eh?
And all these fucking cars.
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.
Major Campbell.
Beg pardon?
It doesn't matter.
Are there any other Irishmen lodging in this house?
No, Mr Campbell, I keep a respectable house.
With your special exception, I have no Irish here.
Well, let me know if any come enquiring after rooms.
Even if you turn them away, let me know, would you?
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.
They only said you was a policeman of some sort.
No.
I'm not expecting any trouble.
Is there a cafe nearby that serves chops?
Lamb or pork?
There is a chophouse two streets away.
But I myself serve sandwiches.
Egg and cress or ham.
Or anything that pleases you.
No.
No.
I think I'll go out and get some air.
Our scheduled meeting is not until Sunday.
I decided to bring it forward.
You just wanted to show me that you know where I live, isn't that it?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
You know...
Mr Churchill was impressed.
Yes, he was.
All my demands have been met.
Did he tell you?
Yes.
Yes.
We had a meeting and your letter was read aloud.
As a matter of fact, there was quite a lot of hilarity at the meeting.
The gentlemen all found it quite funny.
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the gentlemen sometimes find you funny?
We will discuss our business on Sunday... on the agreed day, at the allotted time, and at the place which has already been determined.
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.
There was another reason I came to see you tonight.
I just didn't want you to be made a fool of is all.
The lodgings chosen for you by the police department, how shall I put this?
Well, the landlady used to run the most famous whorehouse in Stechford.
She's only semi-retired.
I bet the gentlemen would find that funny, eh?
Told to you in the spirit of friendship and co-operation.
See you Sunday.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
Your real name.
Harold Hancox.
Profession.
Illegal bookmaker.
You don't admit that.
You say something like "umbrella mender".
And then we decide you're lying and then we arrest you.
Umbrella mender.
You were found in possession of betting slips, race cards and ticker tape.
Any explanation?
No...
"No, I have no explanation for my possession of those items, officer."
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.
Come on, son.
Bloody hellfire.
You've killed him, huh?
As I've explained, he's not easy to get at.
He's got an army round him.
But when the time is right...
The time is right.
It's right now.
When he's away from his familiar territory, I will take him.
So what do you want?
We heard from a guard at Winson Green prison that one of their bookies has just been put inside.
Kid called Harold Hancox.
We could make a point.
How many bakers is there in Camden Town now?
There are a lot of bakers in Camden Town, Mr Sabini, but, as I have said, we don't as yet have a definite number.
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?
Ragman.
~ Where's my dry cleaning?
~ It's been collected.
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?
What?
You don't know?
I can find out.
No need.
I know already.
You see, the favourites, they're all winning.
And the second favourites are being done.
He's bewitching them.
Bewitching?
Gypsy stuff.
Herbs and potions.
And he's tipping off our big punters so they know who's going to win.
Regular customers betraying us for profit.
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see...
.. comes before race, creed and family.
Results look normal to me.
You see shit!
Mr Sabini, if you think they're planning to fix Northern races, we'll take no more bets on anything north of Towcester.
I gave you a job already.
And the job will be done.
But meantime...
Meantime fuck.
Meantime, what do you want us to do about the kid in the cage in Birmingham?
Why would you want me to say that out loud?
Is there somebody listening?
All right, I'll say it.
We'll kill the Hancox kid to send a message.
Good, and then you deal with Tommy fucking Shelby.
You wanted to see me?
Aye.
Take off your clothes.
I know what you are, so take off your clothes.
Not done in a very gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.
Indeed not.
So it's true.
Stop.
I only wanted proof, not satisfaction.
Or indeed infection.
Are you in on the joke?
What joke?
I have unfinished business in this filthy city.
And when the time comes, I will finish that business.
And then my wrath will come down on all of yous.
But now, tell your friends in the police station... that I know.
And when my judgment comes,
I'll be the one that's laughing.
Get out.

This had better be good to interrupt my holiday.
Where's the boy?
In the back room.
I only brought him because afterwards we're going to the museum.
~ He wanted to come in and say hello but... ~ Shut up, John.
There is nothing of interest to Michael in this room.
Tommy, get on with it.
Last night, one of our men had his throat cut in Winson Green.
This morning, I had a telegram to say it was Sabini who ordered it.
And it says here that Thomas Shelby's next.
If our men think we can't look after them in prison, they'll not work for us.
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.
Scudboat, you and one of the boys.
Break a couple of windows and get yourselves arrested.
I'll have our coppers get you into the Green and you can find the bastards who did it.
Instead of breaking a window, can we pinch a car?
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.
I'm still on a donkey.
All right, just get yourselves fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.
And before you all laugh, a boy is dead.
He was just a kid.
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.
Agreed.
So is that it?
Can I go now?
Well, as company treasurer,
I need your permission to spend 1,000 guineas.
On what?
On a horse.
1,000 guineas on a horse?
That's right.
When was this decided?
You've been busy with Michael.
Oh, my God.
So, in the absence of common sense, you boys have had an idea.
Polly... there's a thoroughbred quarter-Arab filly up for auction at the Doncaster Blood Stock.
What do we want with a 1,000-guinea horse?
When we make our move on Sabini's racing pitches, any men we get into the betting enclosure will be lifted by Sabini's police.
A good racehorse is a passport to the owner's enclosure.
We'll be in there with all the toffs.
Coppers won't know where to look.
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.
We'll be drinking with the bloody King.
The Derby?
Did he say the Derby?
That's right.
For the last ten years Sabini's made it his race.
If we're going to take him down, might as well make it there as a symbol.
~ Did you come up with this idea in a pub by any chance?
~ Pol... a good racehorse is an investment, like property.
We need to diversify the portfolio.
So when is this sale?
Tomorrow.
And Tommy's had a death threat so we'll have to go with him for protection.
So, you're going to close up the shop, go out on a piss-up and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse that's not even whole Arab.
Quarter Arab is better!
~ Quarter Arab, it means...
~ Curly, shut up.
I thought I told you to lock that door.
He did.
I used the key on the nail.
Look, I've been listening.
I want to go with them.
You see?
!
I love horses.
I could even help.
Over my dead body.
It'll be all right, Mum...
I've been to loads of horse auctions before with my uncle.
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.
Yeah, and their posh wives!
And their mistresses...
Let him come, Polly.
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.
I'll drop him back at the house in Sutton before it gets dark.
No.
Fucking no.
All right, that's it.
Back to work.
Come on!
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,
I'd killed a hundred men and seen a thousand die.
If you want to scare that kid away for ever, carry on how you're going.
If you want him to stay, let him come.
I can't believe it, all John's old things fit me.
Christ, you look like your father.
Shrimp... ham.
What was he like - my dad?
How did he die?
Well, I won't lie to you, he died drunk, squeezed between a boat and a lock.
A real river gypsy's death.
But he could sing, play the piano...
His smile would break your heart.
You've got his same beautiful eyes.
When he was sober, he was kind and gentle.
His trouble was, he fell in with the wrong crowd when he was a boy.
I have told them not to blow that horn.
This is a respectable fucking neighbourhood!
~ She's heating up, Curly, take a look. ~ Yeah.
Let me out for a piss.
She made loads.
Do you want one?
What the bloody hell's that?
Sandwiches, ham I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.
There's tea, but we'll have to take turns cos there's only one cup.
What?
Sandwiches?
Yeah.
Polly made bloody sandwiches?
What's this, teddy bear's fucking picnic?
All right.
We will drink the tea and we will eat the sandwiches and then we will drive on.
All right?
No crumbs, Charlie.
~ Hand them over. ~ Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard. ~ Fuck off.
John, come on!
All right, lads, this is a respectable event and we will all behave accordingly.
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.
When the horse comes up, I will do the bidding.
I've already registered my interest with the auctioneer so he knows to expect my bids.
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.
It's all right, Curly.
You're just in an unfamiliar place,
~ we all are. ~ I get feelings sometimes, Tommy. ~ It's all right, Curly,
~ it's all right. ~ Shut up, Curly.
~ Do I hear 1,450?
Do I hear 500?
500...
1,600, 1,700, thank you.
1,900, 2,000!
2,100, 2,200, 2...
Why do people come late to these things?
Hmm?
People come late cos they know what they want.
It's only you who needs to see every horse.
2,700 am I bid?
2,600 I am bid...
Sold!
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud, by Tetrach out of Lady Josephine.
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.
All right, Tommy, this is her.
Do I hear 800 guineas?
850.
850, do I hear 9?
Do I hear 9?
~ 9 am I bid?
~ Bid for this one.
The grey?
Why?
~ He's beautiful. ~ It's a filly.
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.
1,000.
Do I hear 1,050?
1,100?
1,200?
Do I hear 250?
250.
I'll go halves with you from the spring fund.
Go, go.
1,300?
1,400?
Do I hear 5?
1,500.
1,600.
Do I hear 7?
1,700, thank you.
~ That's it, Tom, you have to stop.
~ You don't have it in your belt.
Yes, I do.
I'm having the horse.
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But stop, I tell you.
~ I feel something bad.
~ Shut up, Curly!
2,000.
Do I hear 2,050?
2,050 am I bid?
Enough!
Billy could use one of my geldings.
2,000 I am bid.
Do I hear 2,050?
Last time.
2,050?
Sold to Mr...?
Thomas Shelby.
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,
Small Heath.
~ What kind of premises?
~ Boat yard.
Yachts?
Canals.
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?
Import/export.
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes(!
)
You beat us to it.
Did I?
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.
~ Sorry. ~ Thomas Shelby from where?
From Birmingham.
Goodness!
No, not much.
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.
What is it you do?
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!
Well, before you go, if you ever decided to put that filly out,
~ I'd be interested in having her.
~ I plan to race her.
Do you have a trainer?
I know people.
I know people, too.
Tommy!
We've got to get this kid back before dark or Polly'll have your balls!
She will have 'em!
We know different people, I would guess.
My father knows Mick Hancock.
Trained three Ascot winners.
Oh, so that was your father?
Yes.
We're joint owners of the stud.
He took the majority share when my husband was killed.
Ypres.
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!
The chickens are hungry!
So will you consider me?
I will consider you.
You still didn't tell me what you do.
Oh, I do bad things.
But you already know that.
Right, about bloody time!
It's the fucking truth, John boy.
Rich women these days, all they want is working-class cock.
Tommy, maybe she was the something bad I had a feeling about!
She looked all right to me, Curly!
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.
Yeah, by us.
All I'll say is she has good contacts in the racing world.
Here, Michael, you drive.
Thomas Shelby?
Tommy!
Tommy!
Down!
Tommy Shelby?
How about fucking Arthur?
!
Fucking good to meet you.
Get him off him!
~ Arthur!
~ Arthur!
Get him off him!
Come on.
Stop it, Arthur.
Get him off.
Arthur, that's enough.
Arthur, come on!
Come on, Arthur, come on.
It's over.
Arthur!
Come on, shut up.
Come on, come on.
He's still breathing.
Don't get blood on the kid!
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?
Give me the keys.
Michael, give me the keys.
I'm all right to drive.
All right.
Go on.
Go on, go on!
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!
~ Right, let's get out of here sharpish. ~ Come on!
So... how'd it go?
Well, it was cold in the van but it was super... really.
Let me smell your breath.
And did they behave themselves?
They were amazing, Mum.
They were really amazing.

But Pol...
Michael is alive.
I'm looking for someone called Elizabeth Gray.
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?
I think she might be my mother.

He was murdered this morning in a street show in the Patch.
He was Irish.
Is he a person of interest to your department, sir?
Do you read the papers?
Birmingham papers.
I recommend the Daily Mail.
It will broaden your mind.
Now, if you read the national press, you would know that the King has offered the rebel Irish a treaty.
Some of the Fenians want to accept it.
The IRA do not.
Now, the IRA have a long and glorious relationship... with the garrotte.
Oh, dear.
Are they fighting amongst themselves, are they, sir?
~ That will be all.
~ Right, sir.
I'm going to be up and down from London quite a bit.
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?
Well, you wouldn't want to stay at the lodgings you had last time though, sir, eh?
Too many bad memories, I suppose.
You should understand, Moss,
I have no regrets about my previous mission in this city.
No, sir?
I imagine you boys have quite a laugh at my expense.
A laugh, sir?
You think it's funny that I developed feelings.
No idea what you're talking about, sir.
I have no regrets about what happened with Miss Burgess.
No "bad memories".
Right, sir.
He's losing his bloody mind.
Next.
Next.
All right then.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
The Dig...
What are you?
A boxer?
Digbeth Kid, like Billy the Kid.
Spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?
Cowboy pictures?
Tom Mix?
Yeah?
What are you...?
!
Wait, wait.
It's not a real gun.
~ Let's have a look then, eh?
~ It's made of wood.
Bang.
Bang.
Very nice.
Where did you get the gun belt?
My sister made it out of an old blacksmith's apron.
My mum did most of the stitching.
She's not my real mum but...
She does what mothers do.
So she made you a gun belt.
All right there, mother's boy.
There's the door, on you go.
We're looking for...
Have you ever been arrested?
~ Yeah.
~ Yeah?
~ No.
~ Good.
You're the first bloke we've had in here today with no criminal record.
Arthur, we can stand him up.
Do you know what that means?
The new Home Secretary wants something done about illegal gambling.
~ Damn right.
~ About bloody time.
So we help our coppers make their quota of convictions by having men stood up to be arrested.
First offence, you'll get a week inside.
We'll give you five quid for your trouble.
How does that sound, cowboy?
Yeah.
Good.
Write your address down for Finn on your way out.
I can't write.
That's all right, Finn can't read.
Don't worry.
Just tell him your address and we'll send someone round.
If the Sheriff don't run you out of town first.
HE CHUCKLES
Good man.
Oh, I don't know, Tom.
Kids these days.
They didn't fight.
So they're different.
They stay kids.
How was it?
I was starving so I would have eaten anything.
But, really, it was super.
Super.
So, er, are you a cook?
Not a cook, no.
The man who came to the house, he was driving a posh car, he looks rich.
What does he do?
~ He works with horses.
~ Really?
!
~ I love horses.
I've got a bay mare.
~ No!
I ride it all the time.
Then it's in the blood.
I've got about a million questions.
So do I.
I've had different pictures in my head.
Well, here I am.
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?
I don't have any choice.
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?
We don't choose.
And that's it.
Yeah, that's right.
God gave you to me.
People took you away.
And it is all right that it's me?
Isn't it?
In a place like this.
I thought it would be worse.
'Run for the hills!
~ 'It's the Digbeth Kid!
' ~ POUNDING ON DOOR
Get out of town, kid, or I'll shoot your fucking head off!
Times up!
~ You're dead, go down. ~ John!
THEY CHUCKLE
All right then, Polly.
Who's this?
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.
~ Pleased to meet you.
~ John.
I'm Arthur.
You've already met me.
I used to throw you out of the window so John could catch you.
I used to put you in a shoebox and kick you down Watery Lane.
I bet you're glad to be back.
I don't remember any of it.
All I remember is the day they took me away.
Well, you're here now, son.
Welcome to the Shelby family.
~ Later on, we'll show you the ropes.
~ Yeah, we'll show you what's what.
Let's leave him be for now, eh?
Come on, boys.
Nice suit.
They seem nice.
Here he is
- Mr Inconspicuous.
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.
How are you feeling?
I've just come out of bandages myself.
Ready for active service.
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.
It's all right, Bill.
You don't have to stand in line for us.
It's men like you we're looking for, Billy.
But you have to pass the medical first.
Sheffield mob showed up at Wincanton trotting track.
I took a bullet.
When do the bandages come off?
When I take 'em off.
One week.
Not before.
You'll smell no rot.
There's no gangrene.
It's been a long time.
Eh, Billy?
What did you do with your medals?
Threw them in the cut.
Same as you.
It was never a hardship having you Black Country boys on our left flank.
And you Brummies did all right on our right.
Damn right.
I want you to be the head of a brigade, Billy.
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.
You'll have 100 men under your command.
And now we've got a member of the Kitchen family on the payroll, maybe your cousins and brothers will let our boats pass through the Black Country without being held up and robbed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Go home, Bill.
Round up any good men you trust and put the word out.
Black Country boys and Brummie boys are on the same side again.
~ That'll be the bloody day.
~ Well, this is the bloody day.
London, man.
There for the taking.
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.
Polly said you had one in the pub.
All right, be quick.
I have business.
Sir.
Polly said you own this place.
She said you own lots of different businesses.
You call her Polly or Mum?
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.
TOMMY SIGHS
~ Who are you calling?
~ My mother.
I mean...
I know what you mean.
And what are you going to tell her?
I'm going to tell her where I am.
And now you're going to tell her you're going home.
Polly said I could stay for a few days.
~ You want to stay?
~ I've only just arrived.
What age are you, Michael?
17.
17.
Which means it's not up to you, right?
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.
You smoke?
No.
Drink?
You're going to call your mother and tell her you're getting the next train home.
When you get there, you're going to write a letter to Polly saying when you're 18 you'll come back here and sort things out.
I just told you.
I make up my own mind.
Do you know what we do, Michael?
We...
Shelbys?
Yes.
I think I know what you do.
Yeah.
You've got smart eyes.
But you're young, so you think what we do is all right.
It's not all right.
People get hurt.
Now call your mother and I will drive you to the station.
No.
In my village, there's this little wishing well.
It's made of white bricks, right in the middle of the village green.
Everybody says how pretty it is.
But I swear to God, if I spend another day in that village,
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.
Probably blow my hands off with it but it'd be worth it.
Just to see all those pretty white bricks spread all over the pretty village green.
Yep.
You're Polly's son all right.

Never give power to the big man, what did I tell you?
Never give power to the big man.
Next lad!
Name?
All right, boys, you've now all been enrolled as bakers in the Aerated Bread Company of Camden Town.
If anyone asks, that's what you do.
You're bakers.
The coppers in Camden Town are on our side, but north or south, you show them that piece of paper.
Tell them you've come down from the north to find work, to break strikes.
Tell them you're fascists if you have to.
We're finding lodgings for you but, for now, you'll sleep here in the bakery.
But don't touch any of the bread, it'll most likely explode.
Any questions?
Yes?
I haven't seen any bread.
THEY LAUGH
TOMMY CLEARS HIS THROAT
He'll wake up.
Granted he won't have any teeth left but he will be a wiser man for it.
And the last thing he will remember is your funny little joke.
Won't he?
Right!
There are fucking rules here.
Yeah, there are fucking rules for a fucking reason.
Quite simply they have to be obeyed.
All right?
Rule number one.
The distinction between bread and rum is not discussed.
Rule number two.
Anything, right, that your superior officer says to you or any of your other fucking superior officers say to you, yeah?
NOT DISCUSSED!
Rule number three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, I don't care.
For the rest of your fucking miserable, measly lives, yeah?
Because I, like you, am also a complete fucking sodomite.
Jewish women.
You do not go anywhere near them because Jewish women for you are off the fucking menu.
I think that's fair.
All right, that's it, yeah.
Forgive me, I interrupted.
Pick him up.
(Get them out of here and make this fucking work.)
Don't fucking wait!
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!
You're a fucking disgrace!
Go!
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH
DOOR OPENS
You've got a key?
I kept a spare.
Give it to me.
Could do with some paint, eh?
Yeah.
When I decide.
What is it that you want, Tommy?
Just came by to say hello.
Tommy Shelby never goes anywhere for no reason.
~ HE SIGHS ~ Fine.
I've got £800 left in the Shelby property fund and I need someone down here to look for suitable properties.
To rent?
Yes.
To poor people.
Ten to a room.
No repairs, no water.
And if they complain, you just send Arthur and the boys round.
I give advice down at the library.
Families thrown onto the street.
It's men like you we're fighting.
Well, anyway, I was just passing, thanks for the tea.
Tommy.
There are always men outside watching the house.
Yeah.
Gangsters of the worst kind.
But they're there to keep you safe.
No, there are others.
They look like coppers.
They're on your side as well.
~ I don't have a fucking side.
~ Ada... yes, you do.
And, anyway, if I thought there was no-one watching the house,
I couldn't sleep.
Cheerio then.
That was great, well done.
Out we get then.
This house is mine.
I've taken on a maid.
She's made up the big room for you.
Come on, let's have a look.
I thought we could spend the week here.
You know, get to know each other... again.
I've got ham.
Do you like ham?
I like ham, yes.
~ I've got a maid...
~ Yes, you said.
She's upstairs.
She can give us some tea.
Look, I ring this bell.
Watch.

Yes, madam?
I think we'd like some tea.
You get used to it.
MUSIC:

The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.
I'm not a cleaner.
But I have come to clean away some dirt.
Why don't you put that away before it goes off?
You killed my son, you Peaky bastard!
You beat him and beat him and beat him.
Your son was a boxer.
No!
He was a boy... who got into a ring with an animal.
Yeah, ain't that the truth.
I've come to stop you... .. because the coppers and nobody else will.
If you're going to use it, point that thing at my head.
That's where the trouble is.
Gut-shot soldiers take half a day to die.
I've seen 'em.
Walking around with their guts in their arms like dirty washing.
Hold that gun up and do it.
Well, then, do it!
Do it!
SHE PANTS
I'm going to finish my drink.
You can finish it with me if you like.
Now, look.
Look at me.
We've got a fund.
For you, you'll get paid weekly.
I know it won't bring back your son.
I know that.
And you have other sons.
You do.
And we'll find them work.
And you won't have to work.
You'll be...
SHE SCREAMS
Somebody has got to stop you people.
Who broke the fucking mirror?
Seven years bad luck, that is.
There'll be another four boat-loads tomorrow.
What's up, Charlie?
Business is good.
This isn't business, this is bloody work.
Cigarettes and booze is all right but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.
I'm not even sure it's stolen.
Some of it is legally purchased.
One day, all of it will be.
It's like having a fucking job.
Easy with them fan belts.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.
Done.
You don't even fight me anymore.
And it's no sport getting through the Black Country with this truce.
They just fucking wave at you from the bank.
Well, just wave back, eh?
And all these fucking cars.
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?
KNOCK AT DOOR
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.
Major Campbell.
Beg pardon?
It doesn't matter.
Are there any other Irishmen lodging in this house?
No, Mr Campbell, I keep a respectable house.
With your special exception, I have no Irish here.
Well, let me know if any come enquiring after rooms.
Even if you turn them away, let me know, would you?
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.
They only said you was a policeman of some sort.
No.
I'm not expecting any trouble.
Is there a cafe nearby that serves chops?
Lamb or pork?
There is a chophouse two streets away.
But I myself serve sandwiches.
Egg and cress or ham.
Or anything that pleases you.
No.
No.
I think I'll go out and get some air.
Our scheduled meeting is not until Sunday.
I decided to bring it forward.
You just wanted to show me that you know where I live, isn't that it?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
You know...
Mr Churchill was impressed.
Yes, he was.
All my demands have been met.
Did he tell you?
Yes.
Yes.
We had a meeting and your letter was read aloud.
As a matter of fact, there was quite a lot of hilarity at the meeting.
The gentlemen all found it quite funny.
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the gentlemen sometimes find you funny?
We will discuss our business on Sunday... on the agreed day, at the allotted time, and at the place which has already been determined.
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.
There was another reason I came to see you tonight.
I just didn't want you to be made a fool of is all.
The lodgings chosen for you by the police department, how shall I put this?
Well, the landlady used to run the most famous whorehouse in Stechford.
She's only semi-retired.
I bet the gentlemen would find that funny, eh?
Told to you in the spirit of friendship and co-operation.
See you Sunday.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
Your real name.
Harold Hancox.
Profession.
Illegal bookmaker.
You don't admit that.
You say something like "umbrella mender".
And then we decide you're lying and then we arrest you.
Umbrella mender.
You were found in possession of betting slips, race cards and ticker tape.
Any explanation?
No...
"No, I have no explanation for my possession of those items, officer."
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.
Come on, son.
Bloody hellfire.
You've killed him, huh?
As I've explained, he's not easy to get at.
He's got an army round him.
But when the time is right...
The time is right.
It's right now.
When he's away from his familiar territory, I will take him.
So what do you want?
We heard from a guard at Winson Green prison that one of their bookies has just been put inside.
Kid called Harold Hancox.
We could make a point.
How many bakers is there in Camden Town now?
There are a lot of bakers in Camden Town, Mr Sabini, but, as I have said, we don't as yet have a definite number.
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?
Ragman.
~ Where's my dry cleaning?
~ It's been collected.
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?
What?
You don't know?
I can find out.
No need.
I know already.
You see, the favourites, they're all winning.
And the second favourites are being done.
He's bewitching them.
Bewitching?
Gypsy stuff.
Herbs and potions.
And he's tipping off our big punters so they know who's going to win.
Regular customers betraying us for profit.
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see...
.. comes before race, creed and family.
Results look normal to me.
You see shit!
Mr Sabini, if you think they're planning to fix Northern races, we'll take no more bets on anything north of Towcester.
I gave you a job already.
And the job will be done.
But meantime...
Meantime fuck.
Meantime, what do you want us to do about the kid in the cage in Birmingham?
CHOKING
Why would you want me to say that out loud?
Is there somebody listening?
All right, I'll say it.
We'll kill the Hancox kid to send a message.
Good, and then you deal with Tommy fucking Shelby.
KNOCK ON DOOR
You wanted to see me?
Aye.
Take off your clothes.
I know what you are, so take off your clothes.
COINS JINGLE
Not done in a very gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.
Indeed not.
So it's true.
Stop.
I only wanted proof, not satisfaction.
Or indeed infection.
Are you in on the joke?
What joke?
I have unfinished business in this filthy city.
And when the time comes, I will finish that business.
And then my wrath will come down on all of yous.
But now, tell your friends in the police station... that I know.
And when my judgment comes,
I'll be the one that's laughing.
Get out.

DOOR OPENS
Harold Hancox?
Tell everybody this is what happens to "Blinders"
who come into the Green from now on.
Orders of Sabini.
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not.
I've been stood up.
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
♪ And neither have I the wings to fly. ♪
This had better be good to interrupt my holiday.
Where's the boy?
In the back room.
I only brought him because afterwards we're going to the museum.
~ He wanted to come in and say hello but... ~ Shut up, John.
There is nothing of interest to Michael in this room.
Tommy, get on with it.
Last night, one of our men had his throat cut in Winson Green.
This morning, I had a telegram to say it was Sabini who ordered it.
And it says here that Thomas Shelby's next.
If our men think we can't look after them in prison, they'll not work for us.
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.
Scudboat, you and one of the boys.
Break a couple of windows and get yourselves arrested.
I'll have our coppers get you into the Green and you can find the bastards who did it.
Instead of breaking a window, can we pinch a car?
THEY LAUGH
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.
I'm still on a donkey.
All right, just get yourselves fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.
And before you all laugh, a boy is dead.
He was just a kid.
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.
Agreed.
So is that it?
Can I go now?
Well, as company treasurer,
I need your permission to spend 1,000 guineas.
On what?
On a horse.
1,000 guineas on a horse?
That's right.
When was this decided?
You've been busy with Michael.
Oh, my God.
So, in the absence of common sense, you boys have had an idea.
Polly... there's a thoroughbred quarter-Arab filly up for auction at the Doncaster Blood Stock.
What do we want with a 1,000-guinea horse?
When we make our move on Sabini's racing pitches, any men we get into the betting enclosure will be lifted by Sabini's police.
A good racehorse is a passport to the owner's enclosure.
We'll be in there with all the toffs.
Coppers won't know where to look.
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.
We'll be drinking with the bloody King.
The Derby?
Did he say the Derby?
That's right.
For the last ten years Sabini's made it his race.
If we're going to take him down, might as well make it there as a symbol.
~ Did you come up with this idea in a pub by any chance?
~ Pol... a good racehorse is an investment, like property.
We need to diversify the portfolio.
So when is this sale?
Tomorrow.
And Tommy's had a death threat so we'll have to go with him for protection.
So, you're going to close up the shop, go out on a piss-up and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse that's not even whole Arab.
~ CURLY GIGGLES ~ Quarter Arab is better!
~ Quarter Arab, it means...
~ Curly, shut up.
I thought I told you to lock that door.
He did.
I used the key on the nail.
Look, I've been listening.
I want to go with them.
You see?
!
I love horses.
I could even help.
Over my dead body.
It'll be all right, Mum...
I've been to loads of horse auctions before with my uncle.
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.
Yeah, and their posh wives!
And their mistresses...
Let him come, Polly.
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.
I'll drop him back at the house in Sutton before it gets dark.
No.
Fucking no.
All right, that's it.
Back to work.
Come on!
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,
I'd killed a hundred men and seen a thousand die.
If you want to scare that kid away for ever, carry on how you're going.
If you want him to stay, let him come.
I can't believe it, all John's old things fit me.
Christ, you look like your father.
Shrimp... ham.
What was he like - my dad?
How did he die?
Well, I won't lie to you, he died drunk, squeezed between a boat and a lock.
A real river gypsy's death.
But he could sing, play the piano...
His smile would break your heart.
You've got his same beautiful eyes.
When he was sober, he was kind and gentle.
His trouble was, he fell in with the wrong crowd when he was a boy.
CAR HORN BLOWS
I have told them not to blow that horn.
This is a respectable fucking neighbourhood!
~ She's heating up, Curly, take a look. ~ Yeah.
Let me out for a piss.
MICHAEL:
She made loads.
Do you want one?
What the bloody hell's that?
Sandwiches, ham I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.
There's tea, but we'll have to take turns cos there's only one cup.
What?
Sandwiches?
Yeah.
Polly made bloody sandwiches?
What's this, teddy bear's fucking picnic?
All right.
We will drink the tea and we will eat the sandwiches and then we will drive on.
All right?
No crumbs, Charlie.
~ Hand them over. ~ Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard. ~ Fuck off.
John, come on!
All right, lads, this is a respectable event and we will all behave accordingly.
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.
When the horse comes up, I will do the bidding.
I've already registered my interest with the auctioneer so he knows to expect my bids.
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.
It's all right, Curly.
You're just in an unfamiliar place,
~ we all are. ~ I get feelings sometimes, Tommy. ~ It's all right, Curly,
~ it's all right. ~ Shut up, Curly.
~ AUCTIONEER:
Do I hear 1,450?
Do I hear 500?
500...
1,600, 1,700, thank you.
1,900, 2,000!
2,100, 2,200, 2...
Why do people come late to these things?
Hmm?
People come late cos they know what they want.
It's only you who needs to see every horse.
2,700 am I bid?
2,600 I am bid...
Sold!
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud, by Tetrach out of Lady Josephine.
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.
All right, Tommy, this is her.
Do I hear 800 guineas?
850.
850, do I hear 9?
Do I hear 9?
~ 9 am I bid?
~ Bid for this one.
The grey?
Why?
~ He's beautiful. ~ It's a filly.
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.
1,000.
Do I hear 1,050?
1,100?
1,200?
Do I hear 250?
250.
I'll go halves with you from the spring fund.
Go, go.
1,300?
1,400?
Do I hear 5?
1,500.
1,600.
Do I hear 7?
1,700, thank you.
~ That's it, Tom, you have to stop.
~ You don't have it in your belt.
Yes, I do.
I'm having the horse.
CURLY:
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But stop, I tell you.
~ I feel something bad.
~ Shut up, Curly!
2,000.
Do I hear 2,050?
2,050 am I bid?
Enough!
Billy could use one of my geldings.
2,000 I am bid.
Do I hear 2,050?
Last time.
2,050?
Sold to Mr...?
Thomas Shelby.
THE CROWD MURMURS
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,
Small Heath.
~ What kind of premises?
~ Boat yard.
Yachts?
Canals.
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?
Import/export.
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes(!
)
You beat us to it.
Did I?
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.
~ Sorry. ~ Thomas Shelby from where?
From Birmingham.
Goodness!
No, not much.
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.
What is it you do?
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.
~ Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!
~ THE MEN LAUGH
Well, before you go, if you ever decided to put that filly out,
~ I'd be interested in having her.
~ I plan to race her.
Do you have a trainer?
I know people.
I know people, too.
Tommy!
We've got to get this kid back before dark or Polly'll have your balls!
She will have 'em!
We know different people, I would guess.
My father knows Mick Hancock.
Trained three Ascot winners.
Oh, so that was your father?
Yes.
We're joint owners of the stud.
He took the majority share when my husband was killed.
Ypres.
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!
The chickens are hungry!
So will you consider me?
I will consider you.
You still didn't tell me what you do.
Oh, I do bad things.
But you already know that.
Right, about bloody time!
It's the fucking truth, John boy.
Rich women these days, all they want is working-class cock.
Tommy, maybe she was the something bad I had a feeling about!
She looked all right to me, Curly!
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.
Yeah, by us.
All I'll say is she has good contacts in the racing world.
Here, Michael, you drive.
Thomas Shelby?
Tommy!
Tommy!
Down!
Tommy Shelby?
How about fucking Arthur?
!
Fucking good to meet you.
Get him off him!
~ Arthur!
~ Arthur!
Get him off him!
Come on.
Stop it, Arthur.
Get him off.
Arthur, that's enough.
Arthur, come on!
Come on, Arthur, come on.
It's over.
Arthur!
Come on, shut up.
Come on, come on.
He's still breathing.
Don't get blood on the kid!
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?
Give me the keys.
Michael, give me the keys.
I'm all right to drive.
All right.
Go on.
Go on, go on!
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!
~ Right, let's get out of here sharpish. ~ Come on!

Is he a person of interest to your department, sir?
Do you read the papers?
Birmingham papers.
I recommend the Daily Mail.
It will broaden your mind.
Now, if you read the national press, you would know that the King has offered the rebel Irish a treaty.
Some of the Fenians want to accept it.
The IRA do not.
Now, the IRA have a long and glorious relationship... with the garrotte.
Oh, dear.
Are they fighting amongst themselves, are they, sir?
~ That will be all.
~ Right, sir.
I'm going to be up and down from London quite a bit.
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?
Well, you wouldn't want to stay at the lodgings you had last time though, sir, eh?
Too many bad memories, I suppose.
You should understand, Moss,
I have no regrets about my previous mission in this city.
No, sir?
I imagine you boys have quite a laugh at my expense.
A laugh, sir?
You think it's funny that I developed feelings.
No idea what you're talking about, sir.
I have no regrets about what happened with Miss Burgess.
No "bad memories".
Right, sir.
He's losing his bloody mind.

Yeah?
What are you...?

Wait, wait.
It's not a real gun.
~ Let's have a look then, eh?
~ It's made of wood.
Bang.
Bang.
Very nice.
Where did you get the gun belt?
My sister made it out of an old blacksmith's apron.
My mum did most of the stitching.
She's not my real mum but...
She does what mothers do.
So she made you a gun belt.
All right there, mother's boy.
There's the door, on you go.
We're looking for...
Have you ever been arrested?
~ Yeah.
~ Yeah?
~ No.
~ Good.
You're the first bloke we've had in here today with no criminal record.
Arthur, we can stand him up.
Do you know what that means?
The new Home Secretary wants something done about illegal gambling.
~ Damn right.
~ About bloody time.
So we help our coppers make their quota of convictions by having men stood up to be arrested.
First offence, you'll get a week inside.
We'll give you five quid for your trouble.
How does that sound, cowboy?
Yeah.
Good.
Write your address down for Finn on your way out.
I can't write.
That's all right, Finn can't read.
Don't worry.

I was starving so I would have eaten anything.
But, really, it was super.
Super.
So, er, are you a cook?
Not a cook, no.
The man who came to the house, he was driving a posh car, he looks rich.
What does he do?
~ He works with horses.
~ Really?

~ I love horses.
I've got a bay mare.
~ No!
I ride it all the time.
Then it's in the blood.
I've got about a million questions.
So do I.
I've had different pictures in my head.
Well, here I am.
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?
I don't have any choice.
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?
We don't choose.
And that's it.
Yeah, that's right.
God gave you to me.
People took you away.
And it is all right that it's me?
Isn't it?
In a place like this.

All right then, Polly.
Who's this?
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.
~ Pleased to meet you.
~ John.
I'm Arthur.
You've already met me.
I used to throw you out of the window so John could catch you.
I used to put you in a shoebox and kick you down Watery Lane.
I bet you're glad to be back.
I don't remember any of it.
All I remember is the day they took me away.
Well, you're here now, son.
Welcome to the Shelby family.
~ Later on, we'll show you the ropes.
~ Yeah, we'll show you what's what.
Let's leave him be for now, eh?
Come on, boys.
Nice suit.
They seem nice.
Here he is

Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.
How are you feeling?
I've just come out of bandages myself.
Ready for active service.
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.
It's all right, Bill.
You don't have to stand in line for us.
It's men like you we're looking for, Billy.
But you have to pass the medical first.
Sheffield mob showed up at Wincanton trotting track.
I took a bullet.
When do the bandages come off?
When I take 'em off.
One week.
Not before.
You'll smell no rot.
There's no gangrene.
It's been a long time.
Eh, Billy?
What did you do with your medals?
Threw them in the cut.
Same as you.
It was never a hardship having you Black Country boys on our left flank.
And you Brummies did all right on our right.
Damn right.
I want you to be the head of a brigade, Billy.
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.
You'll have 100 men under your command.
And now we've got a member of the Kitchen family on the payroll, maybe your cousins and brothers will let our boats pass through the Black Country without being held up and robbed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Go home, Bill.
Round up any good men you trust and put the word out.
Black Country boys and Brummie boys are on the same side again.
~ That'll be the bloody day.
~ Well, this is the bloody day.
London, man.
There for the taking.
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.
Polly said you had one in the pub.
All right, be quick.
I have business.
Sir.
Polly said you own this place.
She said you own lots of different businesses.
You call her Polly or Mum?
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.
TOMMY SIGHS
~ Who are you calling?
~ My mother.
I mean...
I know what you mean.
And what are you going to tell her?
I'm going to tell her where I am.
And now you're going to tell her you're going home.
Polly said I could stay for a few days.
~ You want to stay?
~ I've only just arrived.
What age are you, Michael?
17.
17.
Which means it's not up to you, right?
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.
You smoke?
No.
Drink?
You're going to call your mother and tell her you're getting the next train home.
When you get there, you're going to write a letter to Polly saying when you're 18 you'll come back here and sort things out.
I just told you.
I make up my own mind.
Do you know what we do, Michael?
We...
Shelbys?
Yes.
I think I know what you do.
Yeah.
You've got smart eyes.
But you're young, so you think what we do is all right.
It's not all right.
People get hurt.
Now call your mother and I will drive you to the station.
No.
In my village, there's this little wishing well.
It's made of white bricks, right in the middle of the village green.
Everybody says how pretty it is.
But I swear to God, if I spend another day in that village,
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.
Probably blow my hands off with it but it'd be worth it.
Just to see all those pretty white bricks spread all over the pretty village green.
Yep.
You're Polly's son all right.

Well, let me know if any come enquiring after rooms.
Even if you turn them away, let me know, would you?
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.
They only said you was a policeman of some sort.
No.
I'm not expecting any trouble.
Is there a cafe nearby that serves chops?
Lamb or pork?
There is a chophouse two streets away.
But I myself serve sandwiches.
Egg and cress or ham.
Or anything that pleases you.
No.
No.
I think I'll go out and get some air.
Our scheduled meeting is not until Sunday.
I decided to bring it forward.
You just wanted to show me that you know where I live, isn't that it?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
You know...
Mr Churchill was impressed.
Yes, he was.
All my demands have been met.
Did he tell you?
Yes.
Yes.
We had a meeting and your letter was read aloud.
As a matter of fact, there was quite a lot of hilarity at the meeting.
The gentlemen all found it quite funny.
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the gentlemen sometimes find you funny?
We will discuss our business on Sunday... on the agreed day, at the allotted time, and at the place which has already been determined.
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.
There was another reason I came to see you tonight.
I just didn't want you to be made a fool of is all.
The lodgings chosen for you by the police department, how shall I put this?
Well, the landlady used to run the most famous whorehouse in Stetchford.
She's only semi-retired.
I bet the gentlemen would find that funny, eh?
Told to you in the spirit of friendship and co-operation.
See you Sunday.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
Your real name.
Harold Hancox.
Profession.
Illegal bookmaker.
You don't admit that.
You say something like "umbrella mender".
And then we decide you're lying and then we arrest you.
Umbrella mender.
You were found in possession of betting slips, race cards and ticker tape.
Any explanation?
No...
"No, I have no explanation for my possession of those items, officer."
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.
Come on, son.
Bloody hellfire.
You've killed him, huh?
As I've explained, he's not easy to get at.
He's got an army round him.
But when the time is right...
The time is right.
It's right now.
When he's away from his familiar territory, I will take him.
So what do you want?
We heard from a guard at Winson Green prison that one of their bookies has just been put inside.
Kid called Harold Hancox.
We could make a point.
How many bakers is there in Camden Town now?
There are a lot of bakers in Camden Town, Mr Sabini, but, as I have said, we don't as yet have a definite number.
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?
Ragman.
~ Where's my dry cleaning?
~ It's been collected.
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?
What?
You don't know?
I can find out.
No need.
I know already.
You see, the favourites, they're all winning.
And the second favourites are being done.
He's bewitching them.
Bewitching?
Gypsy stuff.
Herbs and potions.
And he's tipping off our big punters so they know who's going to win.
Regular customers betraying us for profit.
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see...
.. comes before race, creed and family.
Results look normal to me.
You see shit!
Mr Sabini, if you think they're planning to fix Northern races, we'll take no more bets on anything north of Towcester.
I gave you a job already.
And the job will be done.
But meantime...
Meantime fuck.
Meantime, what do you want us to do about the kid in the cage in Birmingham?
CHOKING
Why would you want me to say that out loud?
Is there somebody listening?
All right, I'll say it.
We'll kill the Hancox kid to send a message.
Good, and then you deal with Tommy fucking Shelby.
KNOCK ON DOOR
You wanted to see me?
Aye.
Take off your clothes.
I know what you are, so take off your clothes.
COINS JINGLE
Not done in a very gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.
Indeed not.
So it's true.
Stop.
I only wanted proof, not satisfaction.
Or indeed infection.
Are you in on the joke?
What joke?
I have unfinished business in this filthy city.
And when the time comes, I will finish that business.
And then my wrath will come down on all of yous.
But now, tell your friends in the police station... that I know.
And when my judgment comes,
I'll be the one that's laughing.
Get out.

DOOR OPENS
Harold Hancox?
Tell everybody this is what happens to "Blinders"
who come into the Green from now on.
Orders of Sabini.
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not.
I've been stood up.
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
♪ And neither have I the wings to fly. ♪
This had better be good to interrupt my holiday.
Where's the boy?
In the back room.
I only brought him because afterwards we're going to the museum.
~ He wanted to come in and say hello but... ~ Shut up, John.
There is nothing of interest to Michael in this room.
Tommy, get on with it.
Last night, one of our men had his throat cut in Winson Green.
This morning, I had a telegram to say it was Sabini who ordered it.
And it says here that Thomas Shelby's next.
If our men think we can't look after them in prison, they'll not work for us.
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.
Scudboat, you and one of the boys.
Break a couple of windows and get yourselves arrested.
I'll have our coppers get you into the Green and you can find the bastards who did it.
Instead of breaking a window, can we pinch a car?
THEY LAUGH
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.
I'm still on a donkey.
All right, just get yourselves fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.
And before you all laugh, a boy is dead.
He was just a kid.
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.
Agreed.
So is that it?
Can I go now?
Well, as company treasurer,
I need your permission to spend 1,000 guineas.
On what?
On a horse.
1,000 guineas on a horse?
That's right.
When was this decided?
You've been busy with Michael.
Oh, my God.
So, in the absence of common sense, you boys have had an idea.
Polly... there's a thoroughbred quarter-Arab filly up for auction at the Doncaster Blood Stock.
What do we want with a 1,000-guinea horse?
When we make our move on Sabini's racing pitches, any men we get into the betting enclosure will be lifted by Sabini's police.
A good racehorse is a passport to the owner's enclosure.
We'll be in there with all the toffs.
Coppers won't know where to look.
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.
We'll be drinking with the bloody King.
The Derby?
Did he say the Derby?
That's right.
For the last ten years Sabini's made it his race.
If we're going to take him down, might as well make it there as a symbol.
~ Did you come up with this idea in a pub by any chance?
~ Pol... a good racehorse is an investment, like property.
We need to diversify the portfolio.
So when is this sale?
Tomorrow.
And Tommy's had a death threat so we'll have to go with him for protection.
So, you're going to close up the shop, go out on a piss-up and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse that's not even whole Arab.
~ CURLY GIGGLES ~ Quarter Arab is better!
~ Quarter Arab, it means...
~ Curly, shut up.
I thought I told you to lock that door.
He did.
I used the key on the nail.
Look, I've been listening.
I want to go with them.
You see?
!
I love horses.
I could even help.
Over my dead body.
It'll be all right, Mum...
I've been to loads of horse auctions before with my uncle.
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.
Yeah, and their posh wives!
And their mistresses...
Let him come, Polly.
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.
I'll drop him back at the house in Sutton before it gets dark.
No.
Fucking no.
All right, that's it.
Back to work.
Come on!
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,
I'd killed a hundred men and seen a thousand die.
If you want to scare that kid away for ever, carry on how you're going.
If you want him to stay, let him come.
I can't believe it, all John's old things fit me.
Christ, you look like your father.
Shrimp... ham.
What was he like - my dad?
How did he die?
Well, I won't lie to you, he died drunk, squeezed between a boat and a lock.
A real river gypsy's death.
But he could sing, play the piano...
His smile would break your heart.
You've got his same beautiful eyes.
When he was sober, he was kind and gentle.
His trouble was, he fell in with the wrong crowd when he was a boy.
CAR HORN BLOWS
I have told them not to blow that horn.
This is a respectable fucking neighbourhood!
~ She's heating up, Curly, take a look. ~ Yeah.
Let me out for a piss.
MICHAEL:
She made loads.
Do you want one?
What the bloody hell's that?
Sandwiches, ham I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.
There's tea, but we'll have to take turns cos there's only one cup.
What?
Sandwiches?
Yeah.
Polly made bloody sandwiches?
What's this, teddy bear's fucking picnic?
All right.
We will drink the tea and we will eat the sandwiches and then we will drive on.
All right?
No crumbs, Charlie.
~ Hand them over. ~ Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard. ~ Fuck off.
John, come on!
All right, lads, this is a respectable event and we will all behave accordingly.
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.
When the horse comes up, I will do the bidding.
I've already registered my interest with the auctioneer so he knows to expect my bids.
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.
It's all right, Curly.
You're just in an unfamiliar place,
~ we all are. ~ I get feelings sometimes, Tommy. ~ It's all right, Curly,
~ it's all right. ~ Shut up, Curly.
~ AUCTIONEER:
Do I hear 1,450?
Do I hear 500?
500...
1,600, 1,700, thank you.
1,900, 2,000!
2,100, 2,200, 2...
Why do people come late to these things?
Hmm?
People come late cos they know what they want.
It's only you who needs to see every horse.
2,700 am I bid?
2,600 I am bid...
Sold!
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud, by Tetrach out of Lady Josephine.
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.
All right, Tommy, this is her.
Do I hear 800 guineas?
850.
850, do I hear 9?
Do I hear 9?
~ 9 am I bid?
~ Bid for this one.
The grey?
Why?
~ He's beautiful. ~ It's a filly.
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.
1,000.
Do I hear 1,050?
1,100?
1,200?
Do I hear 250?
250.
I'll go halves with you from the spring fund.
Go, go.
1,300?
1,400?
Do I hear 5?
1,500.
1,600.
Do I hear 7?
1,700, thank you.
~ That's it, Tom, you have to stop.
~ You don't have it in your belt.
Yes, I do.
I'm having the horse.
CURLY:
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But stop, I tell you.
~ I feel something bad.
~ Shut up, Curly!
2,000.
Do I hear 2,050?
2,050 am I bid?
Enough!
Billy could use one of my geldings.
2,000 I am bid.
Do I hear 2,050?
Last time.
2,050?
Sold to Mr...?
Thomas Shelby.
THE CROWD MURMURS
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,
Small Heath.
~ What kind of premises?
~ Boat yard.
Yachts?
Canals.
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?
Import/export.
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes(!
)
You beat us to it.
Did I?
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.
~ Sorry. ~ Thomas Shelby from where?
From Birmingham.
Goodness!
No, not much.
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.
What is it you do?
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.
~ Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!
~ THE MEN LAUGH
Well, before you go, if you ever decided to put that filly out,
~ I'd be interested in having her.
~ I plan to race her.
Do you have a trainer?
I know people.
I know people, too.
Tommy!
We've got to get this kid back before dark or Polly'll have your balls!
She will have 'em!
We know different people, I would guess.
My father knows Mick Hancock.
Trained three Ascot winners.
Oh, so that was your father?
Yes.
We're joint owners of the stud.
He took the majority share when my husband was killed.
Ypres.
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!
The chickens are hungry!
So will you consider me?
I will consider you.
You still didn't tell me what you do.
Oh, I do bad things.
But you already know that.
Right, about bloody time!
It's the fucking truth, John boy.
Rich women these days, all they want is working-class cock.
Tommy, maybe she was the something bad I had a feeling about!
She looked all right to me, Curly!
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.
Yeah, by us.
All I'll say is she has good contacts in the racing world.
Here, Michael, you drive.
Thomas Shelby?
Tommy!
Tommy!
Down!
Tommy Shelby?
How about fucking Arthur?
!
Fucking good to meet you.
Get him off him!
~ Arthur!
~ Arthur!
Get him off him!
Come on.
Stop it, Arthur.
Get him off.
Arthur, that's enough.
Arthur, come on!
Come on, Arthur, come on.
It's over.
Arthur!
Come on, shut up.
Come on, come on.
He's still breathing.
Don't get blood on the kid!
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?
Give me the keys.
Michael, give me the keys.
I'm all right to drive.
All right.
Go on.
Go on, go on!
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!
~ Right, let's get out of here sharpish. ~ Come on!

Your daughter is dead.
But Pol...
Michael is alive.
I'm looking for someone called Elizabeth Gray.

He was murdered this morning in a street show in the Patch.
He was Irish.
Is he a person of interest to your department, sir?
Do you read the papers?
Birmingham papers.
I recommend the Daily Mail.
It will broaden your mind.
Now, if you read the national press, you would know that the King has offered the rebel Irish a treaty.
Some of the Fenians want to accept it.
The IRA do not.
Now, the IRA have a long and glorious relationship... with the garrotte.
Oh, dear.
Are they fighting amongst themselves, are they, sir?
~ That will be all.
~ Right, sir.
I'm going to be up and down from London quite a bit.
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?
Well, you wouldn't want to stay at the lodgings you had last time though, sir, eh?
Too many bad memories, I suppose.
You should understand, Moss,
I have no regrets about my previous mission in this city.
No, sir?
I imagine you boys have quite a laugh at my expense.
A laugh, sir?
You think it's funny that I developed feelings.
No idea what you're talking about, sir.
I have no regrets about what happened with Miss Burgess.
No "bad memories".
Right, sir.
He's losing his bloody mind.
Next.
Next.
All right then.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
The Dig...
What are you?
A boxer?
Digbeth Kid, like Billy the Kid.
Spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?
Cowboy pictures?
Tom Mix?
Yeah?
What are you...?
!
Wait, wait.
It's not a real gun.
~ Let's have a look then, eh?
~ It's made of wood.
Bang.
Bang.
Very nice.
Where did you get the gun belt?
My sister made it out of an old blacksmith's apron.
My mum did most of the stitching.
She's not my real mum but...
She does what mothers do.
So she made you a gun belt.
All right there, mother's boy.
There's the door, on you go.
We're looking for...
Have you ever been arrested?
~ Yeah.
~ Yeah?
~ No.
~ Good.
You're the first bloke we've had in here today with no criminal record.
Arthur, we can stand him up.
Do you know what that means?
The new Home Secretary wants something done about illegal gambling.
~ Damn right.
~ About bloody time.
So we help our coppers make their quota of convictions by having men stood up to be arrested.
First offence, you'll get a week inside.
We'll give you five quid for your trouble.
How does that sound, cowboy?
Yeah.
Good.
Write your address down for Finn on your way out.
I can't write.
That's all right, Finn can't read.
Don't worry.
Just tell him your address and we'll send someone round.
If the Sheriff don't run you out of town first.
Good man.
Oh, I don't know, Tom.
Kids these days.
They didn't fight.
So they're different.
They stay kids.
How was it?
I was starving so I would have eaten anything.
But, really, it was super.
Super.
So, er, are you a cook?
Not a cook, no.
The man who came to the house, he was driving a posh car, he looks rich.
What does he do?
~ He works with horses.
~ Really?
!
~ I love horses.
I've got a bay mare.
~ No!
I ride it all the time.
Then it's in the blood.
I've got about a million questions.
So do I.
I've had different pictures in my head.
Well, here I am.
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?
I don't have any choice.
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?
We don't choose.
And that's it.
Yeah, that's right.
God gave you to me.
People took you away.
And it is all right that it's me?
Isn't it?
In a place like this.
I thought it would be worse.
'Run for the hills!
'It's the Digbeth Kid!
'
Get out of town, kid, or I'll shoot your fucking head off!
Times up!
~ You're dead, go down. ~ John!
All right then, Polly.
Who's this?
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.
~ Pleased to meet you.
~ John.
I'm Arthur.
You've already met me.
I used to throw you out of the window so John could catch you.
I used to put you in a shoebox and kick you down Watery Lane.
I bet you're glad to be back.
I don't remember any of it.
All I remember is the day they took me away.
Well, you're here now, son.
Welcome to the Shelby family.
~ Later on, we'll show you the ropes.
~ Yeah, we'll show you what's what.
Let's leave him be for now, eh?
Come on, boys.
Nice suit.
They seem nice.
Here he is
- Mr Inconspicuous.
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.
How are you feeling?
I've just come out of bandages myself.
Ready for active service.
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.
It's all right, Bill.
You don't have to stand in line for us.
It's men like you we're looking for, Billy.
But you have to pass the medical first.
Sheffield mob showed up at Wincanton trotting track.
I took a bullet.
When do the bandages come off?
When I take 'em off.
One week.
Not before.
You'll smell no rot.
There's no gangrene.
It's been a long time.
Eh, Billy?
What did you do with your medals?
Threw them in the cut.
Same as you.
It was never a hardship having you Black Country boys on our left flank.
And you Brummies did all right on our right.
Damn right.
I want you to be the head of a brigade, Billy.
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.
You'll have 100 men under your command.
And now we've got a member of the Kitchen family on the payroll, maybe your cousins and brothers will let our boats pass through the Black Country without being held up and robbed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Go home, Bill.
Round up any good men you trust and put the word out.
Black Country boys and Brummie boys are on the same side again.
~ That'll be the bloody day.
~ Well, this is the bloody day.
London, man.
There for the taking.
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.
Polly said you had one in the pub.
All right, be quick.
I have business.
Sir.
Polly said you own this place.
She said you own lots of different businesses.
You call her Polly or Mum?
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.
~ Who are you calling?
~ My mother.
I mean...
I know what you mean.
And what are you going to tell her?
I'm going to tell her where I am.
And now you're going to tell her you're going home.
Polly said I could stay for a few days.
~ You want to stay?
~ I've only just arrived.
What age are you, Michael?
17.
17.
Which means it's not up to you, right?
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.
You smoke?
No.
Drink?
You're going to call your mother and tell her you're getting the next train home.
When you get there, you're going to write a letter to Polly saying when you're 18 you'll come back here and sort things out.
I just told you.
I make up my own mind.
Do you know what we do, Michael?
We...
Shelbys?
Yes.
I think I know what you do.
Yeah.
You've got smart eyes.
But you're young, so you think what we do is all right.
It's not all right.
People get hurt.
Now call your mother and I will drive you to the station.
No.
In my village, there's this little wishing well.
It's made of white bricks, right in the middle of the village green.
Everybody says how pretty it is.
But I swear to God, if I spend another day in that village,
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.
Probably blow my hands off with it but it'd be worth it.
Just to see all those pretty white bricks spread all over the pretty village green.
Yep.
You're Polly's son all right.

All right, boys, you've now all been enrolled as bakers in the Aerated Bread Company of Camden Town.
If anyone asks, that's what you do.
You're bakers.
The coppers in Camden Town are on our side, but north or south, you show them that piece of paper.
Tell them you've come down from the north to find work, to break strikes.
Tell them you're fascists if you have to.
We're finding lodgings for you but, for now, you'll sleep here in the bakery.
But don't touch any of the bread, it'll most likely explode.
Any questions?
Yes?
I haven't seen any bread.
He'll wake up.
Granted he won't have any teeth left but he will be a wiser man for it.
And the last thing he will remember is your funny little joke.
Won't he?
Right!
There are fucking rules here.
Yeah, there are fucking rules for a fucking reason.
Quite simply they have to be obeyed.
All right?
Rule number one.
The distinction between bread and rum is not discussed.
Rule number two.
Anything, right, that your superior officer says to you or any of your other fucking superior officers say to you, yeah?
NOT DISCUSSED!
Rule number three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, I don't care.
For the rest of your fucking miserable, measly lives, yeah?
Because I, like you, am also a complete fucking sodomite.
Jewish women.
You do not go anywhere near them because Jewish women for you are off the fucking menu.
I think that's fair.
All right, that's it, yeah.
Forgive me, I interrupted.
Pick him up.
(Get them out of here and make this fucking work.)
Don't fucking wait!
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!
You're a fucking disgrace!
Go!
You've got a key?
I kept a spare.
Give it to me.
Could do with some paint, eh?
Yeah.
When I decide.
What is it that you want, Tommy?
Just came by to say hello.
Tommy Shelby never goes anywhere for no reason.
Fine.
I've got £800 left in the Shelby property fund and I need someone down here to look for suitable properties.
To rent?
Yes.
To poor people.
Ten to a room.
No repairs, no water.
And if they complain, you just send Arthur and the boys round.
I give advice down at the library.
Families thrown onto the street.
It's men like you we're fighting.
Well, anyway, I was just passing, thanks for the tea.
Tommy.
There are always men outside watching the house.
Yeah.
Gangsters of the worst kind.
But they're there to keep you safe.
No, there are others.
They look like coppers.
They're on your side as well.
~ I don't have a fucking side.
~ Ada... yes, you do.
And, anyway, if I thought there was no-one watching the house,
I couldn't sleep.
Cheerio then.
That was great, well done.
Out we get then.
This house is mine.
I've taken on a maid.
She's made up the big room for you.
Come on, let's have a look.
I thought we could spend the week here.
You know, get to know each other... again.
I've got ham.
Do you like ham?
I like ham, yes.
~ I've got a maid...
~ Yes, you said.
She's upstairs.
She can give us some tea.
Look, I ring this bell.
Watch.
Yes, madam?
I think we'd like some tea.
You get used to it.
MUSIC:
Out Of The Black by Royal Blood
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.
I'm not a cleaner.
But I have come to clean away some dirt.
Why don't you put that away before it goes off?
You killed my son, you Peaky bastard!
You beat him and beat him and beat him.
Your son was a boxer.
No!
He was a boy... who got into a ring with an animal.
Yeah, ain't that the truth.
I've come to stop you... .. because the coppers and nobody else will.
If you're going to use it, point that thing at my head.
That's where the trouble is.
Gut-shot soldiers take half a day to die.
I've seen 'em.
Walking around with their guts in their arms like dirty washing.
Hold that gun up and do it.
Well, then, do it!
Do it!
I'm going to finish my drink.
You can finish it with me if you like.
Now, look.
Look at me.
We've got a fund.
For you, you'll get paid weekly.
I know it won't bring back your son.
I know that.
And you have other sons.
You do.
And we'll find them work.
And you won't have to work.
You'll be...
Somebody has got to stop you people.
Who broke the fucking mirror?
Seven years bad luck, that is.
There'll be another four boat-loads tomorrow.
What's up, Charlie?
Business is good.
This isn't business, this is bloody work.
Cigarettes and booze is all right but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.
I'm not even sure it's stolen.
Some of it is legally purchased.
One day, all of it will be.
It's like having a fucking job.
Easy with them fan belts.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.
Done.
You don't even fight me anymore.
And it's no sport getting through the Black Country with this truce.
They just fucking wave at you from the bank.
Well, just wave back, eh?
And all these fucking cars.
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.
Major Campbell.
Beg pardon?
It doesn't matter.
Are there any other Irishmen lodging in this house?
No, Mr Campbell, I keep a respectable house.
With your special exception, I have no Irish here.
Well, let me know if any come enquiring after rooms.
Even if you turn them away, let me know, would you?
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.
They only said you was a policeman of some sort.
No.
I'm not expecting any trouble.
Is there a cafe nearby that serves chops?
Lamb or pork?
There is a chophouse two streets away.
But I myself serve sandwiches.
Egg and cress or ham.
Or anything that pleases you.
No.
No.
I think I'll go out and get some air.
Our scheduled meeting is not until Sunday.
I decided to bring it forward.
You just wanted to show me that you know where I live, isn't that it?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
You know...
Mr Churchill was impressed.
Yes, he was.
All my demands have been met.
Did he tell you?
Yes.
Yes.
We had a meeting and your letter was read aloud.
As a matter of fact, there was quite a lot of hilarity at the meeting.
The gentlemen all found it quite funny.
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the gentlemen sometimes find you funny?
We will discuss our business on Sunday... on the agreed day, at the allotted time, and at the place which has already been determined.
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.
There was another reason I came to see you tonight.
I just didn't want you to be made a fool of is all.
The lodgings chosen for you by the police department, how shall I put this?
Well, the landlady used to run the most famous whorehouse in Stetchford.
She's only semi-retired.
I bet the gentlemen would find that funny, eh?
Told to you in the spirit of friendship and co-operation.
See you Sunday.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
Your real name.
Harold Hancox.
Profession.
Illegal bookmaker.
You don't admit that.
You say something like "umbrella mender".
And then we decide you're lying and then we arrest you.
Umbrella mender.
You were found in possession of betting slips, race cards and ticker tape.
Any explanation?
No...
"No, I have no explanation for my possession of those items, officer."
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.
Come on, son.
Bloody hellfire.
You've killed him, huh?
As I've explained, he's not easy to get at.
He's got an army round him.
But when the time is right...
The time is right.
It's right now.
When he's away from his familiar territory, I will take him.
So what do you want?
We heard from a guard at Winson Green prison that one of their bookies has just been put inside.
Kid called Harold Hancox.
We could make a point.
How many bakers is there in Camden Town now?
There are a lot of bakers in Camden Town, Mr Sabini, but, as I have said, we don't as yet have a definite number.
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?
Ragman.
~ Where's my dry cleaning?
~ It's been collected.
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?
What?
You don't know?
I can find out.
No need.
I know already.
You see, the favourites, they're all winning.
And the second favourites are being done.
He's bewitching them.
Bewitching?
Gypsy stuff.
Herbs and potions.
And he's tipping off our big punters so they know who's going to win.
Regular customers betraying us for profit.
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see...
.. comes before race, creed and family.
Results look normal to me.
You see shit!
Mr Sabini, if you think they're planning to fix Northern races, we'll take no more bets on anything north of Towcester.
I gave you a job already.
And the job will be done.
But meantime...
Meantime fuck.
Meantime, what do you want us to do about the kid in the cage in Birmingham?
Why would you want me to say that out loud?
Is there somebody listening?
All right, I'll say it.
We'll kill the Hancox kid to send a message.
Good, and then you deal with Tommy fucking Shelby.
You wanted to see me?
Aye.
Take off your clothes.
I know what you are, so take off your clothes.
Not done in a very gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.
Indeed not.
So it's true.
Stop.
I only wanted proof, not satisfaction.
Or indeed infection.
Are you in on the joke?
What joke?
I have unfinished business in this filthy city.
And when the time comes, I will finish that business.
And then my wrath will come down on all of yous.
But now, tell your friends in the police station... that I know.
And when my judgment comes,
I'll be the one that's laughing.
Get out.

I'm not.

This had better be good to interrupt my holiday.
Where's the boy?
In the back room.
I only brought him because afterwards we're going to the museum.
~ He wanted to come in and say hello but... ~ Shut up, John.
There is nothing of interest to Michael in this room.
Tommy, get on with it.
Last night, one of our men had his throat cut in Winson Green.
This morning, I had a telegram to say it was Sabini who ordered it.
And it says here that Thomas Shelby's next.
If our men think we can't look after them in prison, they'll not work for us.
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.
Scudboat, you and one of the boys.
Break a couple of windows and get yourselves arrested.
I'll have our coppers get you into the Green and you can find the bastards who did it.
Instead of breaking a window, can we pinch a car?
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.
I'm still on a donkey.
All right, just get yourselves fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.
And before you all laugh, a boy is dead.
He was just a kid.
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.
Agreed.
So is that it?
Can I go now?
Well, as company treasurer,
I need your permission to spend 1,000 guineas.
On what?
On a horse.
1,000 guineas on a horse?
That's right.
When was this decided?
You've been busy with Michael.
Oh, my God.
So, in the absence of common sense, you boys have had an idea.
Polly... there's a thoroughbred quarter-Arab filly up for auction at the Doncaster Blood Stock.
What do we want with a 1,000-guinea horse?
When we make our move on Sabini's racing pitches, any men we get into the betting enclosure will be lifted by Sabini's police.
A good racehorse is a passport to the owner's enclosure.
We'll be in there with all the toffs.
Coppers won't know where to look.
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.
We'll be drinking with the bloody King.
The Derby?
Did he say the Derby?
That's right.
For the last ten years Sabini's made it his race.
If we're going to take him down, might as well make it there as a symbol.
~ Did you come up with this idea in a pub by any chance?
~ Pol... a good racehorse is an investment, like property.
We need to diversify the portfolio.
So when is this sale?
Tomorrow.
And Tommy's had a death threat so we'll have to go with him for protection.
So, you're going to close up the shop, go out on a piss-up and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse that's not even whole Arab.
Quarter Arab is better!
~ Quarter Arab, it means...
~ Curly, shut up.
I thought I told you to lock that door.
He did.
I used the key on the nail.
Look, I've been listening.
I want to go with them.
You see?
!
I love horses.
I could even help.
Over my dead body.
It'll be all right, Mum...
I've been to loads of horse auctions before with my uncle.
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.
Yeah, and their posh wives!
And their mistresses...
Let him come, Polly.
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.
I'll drop him back at the house in Sutton before it gets dark.
No.
Fucking no.
All right, that's it.
Back to work.
Come on!
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,
I'd killed a hundred men and seen a thousand die.
If you want to scare that kid away for ever, carry on how you're going.
If you want him to stay, let him come.
I can't believe it, all John's old things fit me.
Christ, you look like your father.
Shrimp... ham.
What was he like - my dad?
How did he die?
Well, I won't lie to you, he died drunk, squeezed between a boat and a lock.
A real river gypsy's death.
But he could sing, play the piano...
His smile would break your heart.
You've got his same beautiful eyes.
When he was sober, he was kind and gentle.
His trouble was, he fell in with the wrong crowd when he was a boy.
I have told them not to blow that horn.
This is a respectable fucking neighbourhood!
~ She's heating up, Curly, take a look. ~ Yeah.
Let me out for a piss.
She made loads.
Do you want one?
What the bloody hell's that?
Sandwiches, ham I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.
There's tea, but we'll have to take turns cos there's only one cup.
What?
Sandwiches?
Yeah.
Polly made bloody sandwiches?
What's this, teddy bear's fucking picnic?
All right.
We will drink the tea and we will eat the sandwiches and then we will drive on.
All right?
No crumbs, Charlie.
~ Hand them over. ~ Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard. ~ Fuck off.
John, come on!
All right, lads, this is a respectable event and we will all behave accordingly.
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.
When the horse comes up, I will do the bidding.
I've already registered my interest with the auctioneer so he knows to expect my bids.
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.
It's all right, Curly.
You're just in an unfamiliar place,
~ we all are. ~ I get feelings sometimes, Tommy. ~ It's all right, Curly,
~ it's all right. ~ Shut up, Curly.
~ Do I hear 1,450?
Do I hear 500?
500...
1,600, 1,700, thank you.
1,900, 2,000!
2,100, 2,200, 2...
Why do people come late to these things?
Hmm?
People come late cos they know what they want.
It's only you who needs to see every horse.
2,700 am I bid?
2,600 I am bid...
Sold!
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud, by Tetrach out of Lady Josephine.
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.
All right, Tommy, this is her.
Do I hear 800 guineas?
850.
850, do I hear 9?
Do I hear 9?
~ 9 am I bid?
~ Bid for this one.
The grey?
Why?
~ He's beautiful. ~ It's a filly.
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.
1,000.
Do I hear 1,050?
1,100?
1,200?
Do I hear 250?
250.
I'll go halves with you from the spring fund.
Go, go.
1,300?
1,400?
Do I hear 5?
1,500.
1,600.
Do I hear 7?
1,700, thank you.
~ That's it, Tom, you have to stop.
~ You don't have it in your belt.
Yes, I do.
I'm having the horse.
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But stop, I tell you.
~ I feel something bad.
~ Shut up, Curly!
2,000.
Do I hear 2,050?
2,050 am I bid?
Enough!
Billy could use one of my geldings.
2,000 I am bid.
Do I hear 2,050?
Last time.
2,050?
Sold to Mr...?
Thomas Shelby.
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,
Small Heath.
~ What kind of premises?
~ Boat yard.
Yachts?
Canals.
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?
Import/export.
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes(!
)
You beat us to it.
Did I?
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.
~ Sorry. ~ Thomas Shelby from where?
From Birmingham.
Goodness!
No, not much.
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.
What is it you do?
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!
Well, before you go, if you ever decided to put that filly out,
~ I'd be interested in having her.
~ I plan to race her.
Do you have a trainer?
I know people.
I know people, too.
Tommy!
We've got to get this kid back before dark or Polly'll have your balls!
She will have 'em!
We know different people, I would guess.
My father knows Mick Hancock.
Trained three Ascot winners.
Oh, so that was your father?
Yes.
We're joint owners of the stud.
He took the majority share when my husband was killed.
Ypres.
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!
The chickens are hungry!
So will you consider me?
I will consider you.
You still didn't tell me what you do.
Oh, I do bad things.
But you already know that.
Right, about bloody time!
It's the fucking truth, John boy.
Rich women these days, all they want is working-class cock.
Tommy, maybe she was the something bad I had a feeling about!
She looked all right to me, Curly!
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.
Yeah, by us.
All I'll say is she has good contacts in the racing world.
Here, Michael, you drive.
Thomas Shelby?
Tommy!
Tommy!
Down!
Tommy Shelby?
How about fucking Arthur?
!
Fucking good to meet you.
Get him off him!
~ Arthur!
~ Arthur!
Get him off him!
Come on.
Stop it, Arthur.
Get him off.
Arthur, that's enough.
Arthur, come on!
Come on, Arthur, come on.
It's over.
Arthur!
Come on, shut up.
Come on, come on.
He's still breathing.
Don't get blood on the kid!
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?
Give me the keys.
Michael, give me the keys.
I'm all right to drive.
All right.
Go on.
Go on, go on!
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!
~ Right, let's get out of here sharpish. ~ Come on!
So... how'd it go?
Well, it was cold in the van but it was super... really.
Let me smell your breath.
And did they behave themselves?
They were amazing, Mum.
They were really amazing.

Arthur killed a boy.
TOMMY:
Polly, these are the files for Michael and Anna Gray.
Your daughter is dead.
But, Pol, Michael is alive.
I'm looking for someone called Elizabeth Gray.
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?
I think she might be my mother.
MOSS:
There's an old friend of ours coming back to the city.
He's head of some secret department, the Irish Desk.
Ripped By mstoll
MOSS:
He was murdered this morning in a street show in the Patch.
He was Irish.
Is he a person of interest to your department, sir?
Do you read the papers?
Birmingham papers.
I recommend the Daily Mail.
It will broaden your mind.
Now, if you read the national press, you would know that the king has offered the rebel Irish a treaty.
Now, some of the Fenians want to accept it.
The IRA do not.
Now, the IRA have a long and glorious relationship with the garrotte.
Oh, dear.
Are they fighting amongst themselves, are they, sir?
- That will be all.
-Right, sir.
Oh, Moss, I'm going to be up and down from London quite a bit.
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?
Well, you wouldn't want to stay in the lodgings you had last time then, sir, eh?
Too many bad memories, I suppose.
You should understand, Moss,
I have no regrets about my previous mission in this city.
No, sir?
(CHUCKLING) I imagine you boys have quite a laugh at my expense.
A laugh, sir?
You think it's funny that I developed feelings?
No idea what you're talking about, sir.
I have no regrets about what happened with Miss Burgess.
No "bad memories".
Right, sir.
He's losing his bloody mind.
Next.
Next.
ARTHUR:
All right, then.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
The Dig...
What are you?
A boxer?
Digbeth Kid like Billy the Kid.
Spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?
Cowboy pictures?
Tom Mix?
Yeah?
ARTHUR:
What are you...
Wait, wait.
It's not a real gun.
- Let's have a look then, eh?
-It's made of wood.
(CHUCKLING)
Bang.Bang.
Very nice.
Where did you get the gun belt?
My sister made it out of an old blacksmith's apron.
My mum did most of the stitching.
She's not my real mum, but...
She does what mothers do.
So she made you a gun belt.
All right then, mother's boy.
There's the door.
On you go.
We're looking for...
Have you ever been arrested?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- No.
-Good.
You're the first bloke we've had in here today with no criminal record.
Arthur, we can stand him up.
Do you know what that means?
The new Home Secretary wants something done about illegal gambling.
Damn right.
About bloody time.
So we help our coppers make their quota of convictions by having men stood up to be arrested.
First offence, you'll get a week inside.
We'll give you five quid for your trouble.
How does that sound, cowboy?
Yeah.
Good.
Write your address down for Finn on your way out.
I can't write.
That's all right, Finn can't read.
Don't worry.
Just tell him your address and we'll send someone round.
If the sheriff don't run you out of town first.
(CHUCKLING)
Good man.
- Oh, I don't know, Tom.
Kids these days.
-Hmm.
They didn't fight.
So they're different.
They stay kids.
How was it?
I was starving, so I would have eaten anything.
But really it was super.
Super.
So, uh, are you a cook?
Not a cook.
No.
The man who came to the house, he was driving a posh car.
He looks rich.
What does he do?
- He works with horses.
-Really?
I love horses.
- I've got a bay mare.
-No!
I ride it all the time.
Then it's in the blood.
I've got about a million questions.
So do I.
I've had different pictures in my head.
Well, here I am.
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?
I don't have any choice.
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?
We don't choose.
And that's it.
Yeah, that's right.
God gave you to me.
People took you away.
And it is all right that it's me, isn't it?
In a place like this.
I thought it would be worse.
(CHUCKLING)
ARTHUR:
Run for the hills!
It's the Digbeth Kid!
Get out of town, kid, or I will shoot your fucking head off!
Time's up!
(MIMICS GUNSHOT)
- You're dead, go down.
- John!
All right then, Polly.
Who's this?
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.
Pleased to meet you.
John.
I'm Arthur.
You've already met me.
I used to throw you out of the window, so John could catch you.
I used to put you in a shoebox and kick you down Watery Lane.
I bet you're glad to be back.
I don't remember any of it.
All I remember is the day they took me away.
Well, you're here now, son.
Welcome to the Shelby family.
Later on, we'll show you the ropes.
Hmm.
Yeah, we'll show you what's what.
Let's leave him be for now, eh?
Come on, boys.
- Nice suit.
-(POLLY CHUCKLING)
They seem nice.
Here he is, Mr Inconspicuous.
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.
How are you feeling?
I've just come out of bandages myself.
Ready for active service.
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.
It's all right, Bill.
You don't have to stand in line for us.
It's men like you we're looking for, Billy.
But you have to pass the medical first.
Sheffield mob showed up at Wincanton trotting track.
I took a bullet.
When do the bandages come off?
When I take 'em off.
One week.
Not before.
You'll smell no rot.
There's no gangrene.
It's been a long time.
Eh, Billy?
What did you do with your medals?
Threw them in the cut.
Same as you.
It was never a hardship having you Black Country boys on our left flank.
And you Brummies did all right on our right.
Damn right.
I want you to be the head of a brigade, Bill.
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.
You'll have 100 men under your command.
And now we've got a member of the Kitchen family on the payroll, maybe your cousins and brothers will let our boats pass through the Black Country without being held up and robbed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Go home, Bill.
Round up any good men you can trust and put the word out.
Black Country boys and Brummie boys are on the same side again.
That'll be the bloody day.
Well, this is the bloody day.
London, man.
There for the taking.
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.
Polly said you had one in the pub.
All right, be quick.
I have business.
Sir.
Polly said you own this place.
She said you own lots of different businesses.
You call her Polly or Mum?
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.
(TOMMY SIGHING)
Who are you calling?
My mother.
I mean...
I know what you mean.
And what are you going to tell her?
I'm going to tell her where I am.
And now you're going to tell her you're going home.
Polly said I could stay for a few days.
- You want to stay?
- I've only just arrived.
What age are you Michael?
Seventeen.
Seventeen.
Which means it's not up to you, right?
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.
You smoke?
No.
Drink?
You're going to call your mother, going to tell her you're getting the next train home.
And when you get there, you're going to write a letter to Polly saying when you're 18, you'll come back here and sort things out.
I just told you.
I make up my own mind.
Do you know what we do, Michael?
We, Shelbys.
Yes.
I think I know what you do.
Yeah.
You've got smart eyes.
But you're young, so you think what we do is all right.
It's not all right.
People get hurt.
Now, call your mother and I will drive you to the station.
No.
In my village, there's this little wishing well.
It's made of white bricks, right in the middle of the village green.
Everybody says how pretty it is.
But I swear to God, if I spend another day in that village,
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.
Probably blow my hands off with it, but it'd be worth it.
Just to see all those pretty white bricks spread over the pretty village green.
Hmm.
Yep.
You're Polly's son, all right.
All right boys, let's go to work.
Let's be having it!
Don't wait!
Keep it moving.
Move!
Next lad!
Name?
Abbey Heath.
Abbey Heath.
Profession?
Baker.
Good lad.
Fill it out and fuck off.
Next lad!
Name?
Buddy Halls.
Buddy Halls.
Right.
Profession?
Baker.
Good lad.
Fill it out and fuck off.
Next lad!
- Name?
-Billy Kitchen.
Billy Kitchen.
Occupation?
Head baker.
Fill it out.
Um, Tommy Shelby, mate.
Never give power to the big man, what did I tell you?
Hmm?
Never give power to the big man.
Next lad!
Name?
All right, boys, you've now all been enrolled as bakers in the Aerated Bread Company of Camden Town.
If anyone asks, that's what you do.
You're bakers.
The coppers in Camden Town are on our side, but north or south, you show them that piece of paper.
Tell them you've come down from north to find work, to break strikes.
Tell them you're fascists, if you have to.
We're finding lodgings for you, but for now you'll sleep here in the bakery.
But don't touch any of the bread, it'll most likely explode.
Any questions?
Yes?
I haven't even seen any bread.
(EVERYONE LAUGHING)
(CLEARING THROAT)
He'll wake up.
Granted, he won't have any teeth left, but he will be a wiser man for it.
And the last thing he will remember is your funny little joke.
Won't he?
Right!
There are fucking rules here.
Yeah, there are fucking rules for a fucking reason.
Quite simply, they have to be obeyed.
All right?
Rule number one.
The distinction between bread and rum, yeah, is not discussed.
Rule number two.
Anything, right, that your superior officer says to you or any of your other fucking superior officers say to you, yeah?
Not discussed!
Rule number three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, I don't care.
For the rest of your fucking miserable measly lives, yeah?
Because I, like you, am also a complete fucking sodomite.
Jewish women.
You do not go anywhere near them because Jewish women for you are off the fucking menu.
I think that's fair.
Hmm.
Hmm.
All right, that's it, yeah.
Forgive me, I interrupted you.
Pick him up.
Get them out of here and make this fucking work.
Don't fucking wait!
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!
You're a fucking disgrace!
Go!
(CHUCKLING)
You've got a key?
I kept a spare.
Give it to me.
Could do with some paint, eh?
Yeah, when I decide.
What is it that you want, Tommy?
Just came by to say hello.
Tommy Shelby never goes anywhere for no reason.
(SIGHING) Fine.
I've got 800 pounds left in the Shelby property fund, and I need someone down here to look for suitable properties.
To rent?
Yes.
To poor people.
Ten to a room.
No repairs, no water.
And if they complain, you just send Arthur and the boys round.
You know, I give advice down at the library.
Families thrown on the street.
It's men like you we're fighting.
Well, anyway, I was just passing.
Thanks for the tea.
Tommy.
There are always men outside watching the house.
Yeah.
Gangsters of the worst kind.
But they're there to keep you safe.
No there are others.
They look like coppers.
Well, they're on your side as well.
I don't have a fucking side.
Ada, yes, you do.
And, anyway, if I thought there was no-one watching the house,
I couldn't sleep.
(SIGHING) Cheerio then.
POLLY:
That was great.
Well done.
Out we get then.
This house is mine.
I've taken on a maid.
She's made up the big room for you.
Come on, let's have a look.
I thought we could spend the week here.
You know, get to know each other again.
I've got ham.
Do you like ham?
I like ham, yes.
- I've got a maid...
-Yes, you said.
She's upstairs.
She can give us some tea.
Look, I ring this bell.
Watch.
(BELL RINGING)
Yes, madam?
I think we'd like some tea.
You get used to it.
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.
I'm not a cleaner.
But I have come to clean away some dirt.
Why don't you put that away before it goes off?
You killed my son!
You Peaky bastard!
You beat him and beat him and beat him.
Your son was a boxer.
No!
He was a boy who got into a ring with an animal.
Yeah, ain't that the truth.
I've come to stop you because the coppers and nobody else will.
If you're going to use it, point that thing at my head.
That's where the trouble is.
Gut-shot soldiers take half a day to die.
I've seen 'em.
Walking around with their guts in their arms like dirty washing.
Hold that gun up and do it!
Fucking do it!
Do it!
I'm going to finish my drink.
You can finish it with me, if you like.
(GUNSHOT FIRING)
(CRYING)
Now, look.
Look at me.
We've got a fund.
For you.
You'll get paid weekly.
I know it won't bring back your son.
I know that.
You have other sons.
You do.
And we'll find them work.
And you won't have to work.
- You'll be...
-(SCREAMING)
(CRYING) Somebody has got to stop you people.
Who broke the fucking mirror?
Seven years' bad luck, that is.
TOMMY:
There'll be another four boatloads tomorrow.
What's up, Charlie?
Business is good.
This isn't business, this is bloody work.
Cigarettes and booze is all right, but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.
I'm not even sure it's stolen.
Some of it is legally purchased.
One day, all of it will be.
It's like having a fucking job.
Hey!
Easy with them fan belts.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.
Done.
You don't even fight me any more.
And it's no sport getting through the Black Country with this truce.
They just fucking wave at you from the bank.
Well, just wave back, eh?
And all these fucking cars.
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-Uh.
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.
Major Campbell.
Beg pardon?
It doesn't matter.
Are there any other Irishmen lodging in this house?
No, Mr Campbell, I keep a respectable house.
With your special exception, I have no Irish here.
Well, let me know if any come enquiring after rooms.
Even if you turn them away, let me know, would you?
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.
They only said you was a policeman of some sort.
No.
I'm not expecting any trouble.
Is there a cafe nearby that serves chops?
Lamb or pork?
There is a chophouse two streets away.
But I myself serve sandwiches.
Egg and cress, or ham.
Or anything that pleases you.
No.
No.
No.
I, I think I'll go out and get some air.
Our scheduled meeting is not until Sunday.
I decided to bring it forward.
(CLEARS THROAT)
You just wanted to show me that you know where I live, isn't that it?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
You know, Mr Churchill was impressed.
Yes, he was.
All my demands have been met.
Did he tell you?
Yes.
Yes.
We had a meeting and your letter was read aloud.
As a matter of fact, there was quite a lot of hilarity at the meeting.
- The gentlemen all found it quite funny.
-(CHUCKLES)
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the gentlemen sometimes find you funny?
We will discuss our business on Sunday, on the agreed day, at the allotted time, and at the place that has already been determined.
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.
(CLEARS THROAT) There was another reason I came to see you tonight.
I just didn't want you to be made a fool of, is all.
The lodgings chosen for you by the police department, how shall I put this?
Well, your landlady used to run the most famous whorehouse in Stechford.
She's only semi-retired.
I bet the gentlemen would find that funny, eh?
Told to you in the spirit of friendship and co-operation.
See you Sunday!
- Name?
-Digbeth Kid.
Your real name.
Harold Hancox.
Profession?
Illegal bookmaker.
You don't admit that.
You say something like, "Umbrella mender".
And then we decide you're lying and then we arrest you.
Umbrella mender.
You were found in possession of betting slips, race cards and ticker tape.
Any explanation?
No.
No.
"No.
"I have no explanation
"for my possession of those items, officer."
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.
Come on, son.
Bloody hellfire.
You've killed him, huh?
As I've explained, he's not easy to get at.
He's got an army round him.
But when the time is right...
The time is right.
It's right now.
When he's away from his familiar territory, I will take him.
- So what do you want?
-We heard from a guard at Winson Green prison that one of their bookies has just been put inside.
Kid called Harold Hancox.
We could make a point.
How many bakers is there in Camden Town now?
There are a lot of bakers in Camden Town, Mr Sabini, but, as I have said, we don't as yet have a definite number.
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?
- Ragman.
- (DARBY SNIFFS)
- Where's my dry cleaning?
-It's been collected.
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?
- What?
You don't know?
-I can find out.
No need.
I know already.
You see, the favourites, they're all winning.
And the second favourites are being done.
He's bewitching them.
Bewitching?
Gypsy stuff.
Herbs, potions.
And he's tipping off our big punters, so they know who's going to win.
Regular customers betraying us for profit.
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see,
comes before race, creed, family.
Results look normal to me.
You see shit!
Mr Sabini, if you think they're planning to fix Northern races, we'll take no more bets on anything north of Towcester.
- I gave you a job already.
-And the job will be done.
- But meantime...
-Meantime, fuck!
Meantime, what do you want us to do about the kid in the cage in Birmingham?
Why would you want me to say that out loud?
Is there somebody listening?
(HOARSELY) All right, I'll say it.
We'll kill the Hancox kid to send a message.
Good, and then you deal with Tommy fucking Shelby.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
You wanted to see me?
Aye.
Take off your clothes.
I know what you are.
So, take off your clothes.
Not done in a very gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.
Indeed not.
So it's true.
Stop.
I only wanted proof.
Not satisfaction.
Or indeed infection.
Are you in on the joke?
What joke?
I have unfinished business in this filthy city.
And when the time comes, I will finish that business.
And then my wrath will come down on all of youse.
-(GASPS)
-But now, tell your friends in the police station that I know.
And when my judgement comes,
I'll be the one that's laughing.
Get out.
(LOUD THUDDING)
On the right.
On the right.
We haven't got all night.
Come on!
Let's be having you, Watkins, in there on the right.
On the right!
Come on, boys!
Harold Hancox?
(GRUNTING)
Tell everybody, this is what happens to Blinders who come into the Green from now on.
Orders of Sabini.
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not a Blinder.
I've been stood up.
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
This had better be good to interrupt my holiday.
Where's the boy?
In the back room.
I only brought him because afterwards we're going to the museum.
- He wanted to come in and say hello...
-Shut up, John.
There is nothing of interest to Michael in this room.
Tommy, get on with it.
Last night, one of our men had his throat cut in Winson Green.
This morning, I had a telegram saying it was Sabini who ordered it.
And it says here that Thomas Shelby's next.
If our men think we can't look after them in prison, they'll not work for us.
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.
Scudboat, you and one of the boys break a couple of windows, get yourselves arrested.
I'll have our coppers get you into the Green and you can find the bastards who did it.
Instead of breaking a window, can we pinch a car?
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.
- I'm still on a donkey.
-(CHUCKLING)
All right, just get yourselves fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.
And before you all laugh, a boy is dead.
He was just a kid.
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.
Agreed.
So is that it?
Can I go now?
Well, as company treasurer,
I need your permission to spend 1,000 guineas.
On what?
On a horse.
A thousand guineas on a horse?
That's right.
When was this decided?
You've been busy with Michael.
Oh, my God.
So, in the absence of common sense, you boys have had an idea.
Polly, there's a thoroughbred, quarter-Arab filly up for auction at the Doncaster Bloodstock.
What do we want with a 1,000-guinea horse?
When we make our move on Sabini's racing pitches, any men we get into the betting enclosure will be lifted by Sabini's police.
A good racehorse is a passport to the owner's enclosure.
We'll be in there with all the toffs.
- Coppers won't know where to look.
-Hmm.
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.
We'll be drinking with the bloody king.
The Derby?
Did he say the Derby?
That's right. (CLEARS THROAT)
For the last 10 years, Sabini's made it his race.
If we're going to take him down, might as well make it there, as a symbol.
Did you come up with this idea in a pub by any chance?
Pol.
A good racehorse is an investment, like property.
We need to diversify the portfolio.
So when is this sale?
Tomorrow.
Tommy's had a death threat, so we'll have to go with him for protection.
POLLY:
So, you're going to close up the shop, go out on a piss-up and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse that's not even whole Arab.
CURLY: (LAUGHING) Quarter-Arab is better!
- Quarter-Arab, it means...
-Curly, shut up.
I thought I told you to lock that door.
He did.
I used the key on the nail.
Look, I've been listening.
- I want to go with them.
-You see?
I love horses.
I could even help.
Over my dead body!
It'll be all right, Mum.
I've been to loads of horse auctions before with my uncle.
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.
Yeah, and their posh wives!
And their mistresses.
ARTHUR:
Let him come, Polly.
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.
I'll drop him back at the house in Sutton before it gets dark.
No.
Fucking no!
All right, that's it.
Back to work.
Come on!
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,
I'd killed 100 men and seen 1,000 die.
If you want to scare that kid away forever, carry on how you're going.
If you want him to stay, let him come.
MICHAEL:
I can't believe it.
All John's old things fit me.
Christ, you look like your father.
Shrimp, ham.
What was he like?
My dad?
How did he die?
Well, I won't lie to you.
He died drunk, squeezed between a boat and a lock.
A real river gypsy's death.
But he could sing, play the piano...
His smile would break your heart.
You've got his same beautiful eyes.
When he was sober, he was kind and gentle.
His trouble was, he fell in with the wrong crowd when he was a boy.
(CAR HORN HONKING)
I have told them not to blow that horn.
(SHOUTING) This is a respectable fucking neighbourhood!
-(HISSING) -(ENGINE DYING)
- She's heating up, Curly.
Take a look.
-Yeah.
Let me out for a piss.
She made loads.
Do you want one?
What the bloody hell's that?
Sandwiches.
Ham, I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.
There's tea, but we'll have to take turns 'cause there's only one cup.
What?
Sandwiches?
- Yeah.
-Polly made bloody sandwiches?
What's this?
Teddy bear's fucking picnic?
(CLEARS THROAT) All right.
We will drink the tea and we will eat the sandwiches and then we will drive on.
All right?
No crumbs, Charlie.
- Hand them over.
- Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard.
- Fuck off.
- John, come on!
TOMMY:
All right, lads, this is a respectable event and we will all behave accordingly.
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.
When the horse comes up, I will do the bidding.
I've already registered my interest with the auctioneer.
So he knows to expect my bids.
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.
It's all right, Curly.
You're just in an unfamiliar place, we all are.
- I get feelings sometimes, Tommy.
-It's all right, Curly.
It's all right.
ARTHUR:
Shut up, Curly.
AUCTIONEER:
Do I hear 1,450?
Do I hear 500, 500, 1,600, 1,700?
Thank you.
1,900, 2,000, 2,100, 2,200..
Why do people come late to these things?
Hmm?
People come late 'cause they know what they want.
It's only you who needs to see every horse.
AUCTIONEER:
Am I bid?
2,600.
I am bid!
Sold!
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud, by Tetrarch out of Lady Josephine.
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.
All right, Tommy, this is her.
Do I hear 800 guineas?
850?
850.
Do I hear nine?
Do I hear nine?
Nine, am I bid?
Bid for this one.
The grey?
Why?
- He's beautiful.
-It's a filly.
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.
1,000.
Do I hear 1,050?
1,100?
1,200?
Do I hear 250?
250.
I'll go halves with you from the spring fund.
Go, go.
1,300?
1,400?
Do I hear five?
1,500.
1,600.
Do I hear seven?
1,700.
Thank you.
That's it, Tom, you have to stop.
You don't have it in your belt.
Yes, I do.
I'm having the horse.
CURLY:
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But, stop, I tell you.
- I feel something bad!
-Shut up, Curly!
2,000.
Do I hear 2,050?
2,050.
Am I bid?
-2,050...
-Enough!
Billy could use one of my geldings.
2,000, I am bid.
Do I hear 2,050?
Last time.
2,050?
Sold!
To Mr...
Thomas Shelby.
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,
Small Heath.
- What kind of premises?
-Boat yard.
Yachts?
Canals.
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?
Import, export.
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes.
You beat us to it.
Did I?
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.
- Sorry.
-Thomas Shelby from where?
From Birmingham.
Goodness!
No, not much.
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.
What is it you do?
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.
ARTHUR:
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!
Well, before you go, if you ever decide to put that filly out,
- I'd be interested in having her.
-I plan to race her.
- Do you have a trainer?
-I know people.
- I know people, too.
-Tommy!
We've got to get this kid back before dark or Polly will have your balls!
She will have 'em!
We know different people, I would guess.
My father knows Mick Hancock.
- Trained three Ascot winners.
-Oh, so that was your father?
Yes.
We're joint-owners of the stud.
He took the majority share when my husband was killed.
Ypres.
ARTHUR:
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!
The chickens are hungry!
(SNICKERING)
So will you consider me?
I will consider you.
You still didn't tell me what you do.
Oh!
I do bad things.
But you already know that.
ARTHUR:
Right, about bloody time!
(MEN SNICKERING)
It's the fucking truth, John boy.
Rich women these days, all they want is working-class cock.
Tommy, maybe she was the something bad I had the feeling about!
Ah!
She looks all right to me, Curly!
ARTHUR:
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.
Yeah, by us.
All I'll say is she has good contacts in the racing world.
Here, Michael, you drive.
Thomas Shelby?
- Tommy!
-(GUNSHOT)
- Tommy!
Down!
-(GUNSHOT)
Tommy Shelby?
How about fucking Arthur?
Fucking good to meet you.
Get him off him!
Arthur!
Arthur!
Get him off him!
Come on.
Stop it, Arthur.
Get him off.
Arthur, that's enough.
Arthur, come on!
Come on, Arthur, come on.
That's it.
It's over.
Arthur!
Come on, shut up.
Come on, come on.
He's still breathing.
Don't get blood on the kid!
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?
Give me the keys.
Michael, give me the keys.
I'm all right to drive.
All right.
Go on.
Go on, go on!
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!
- Right, let's get out of here, sharpish.
-Come on!
(DOOR OPENING)
(DOOR CLOSING)
So?
How'd it go?
Well, it was cold in the van, but it was super.
Really.
Let me smell your breath.
(EXHALES)
Did they behave themselves?
They were amazing, Mum.
They were really amazing.
(SIGHS)
Ripped By mstoll
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs have been at war in London.
The Jews have been having the worst of it.
They need allies.
Tell us your plan.
I can offer you 1 00 good men.
(GRUNTING)
Get him out of there, get him back!
Arthur killed a boy.
TOMMY:
Polly, these are the files for Michael and Anna Gray.
Your daughter is dead.
But, Pol, Michael is alive.
I'm looking for someone called Elizabeth Gray.
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?
I think she might be my mother.
MOSS:
There's an old friend of ours coming back to the city.
He's head of some secret department, the Irish Desk.
MOSS:
He was murdered this morning in a street show in the Patch.
He was Irish.
Is he a person of interest to your department, sir?
Do you read the papers?
Birmingham papers.
I recommend the DailyMail.
It will broaden your mind.
Now, if you read the national press, you would know that the king has offered the rebel Irish a treaty.
Now, some of the Fenians want to accept it.
The IRA do not.
Now, the IRA have a long and glorious relationship with the garrotte.
Oh, dear.
Are they fighting amongst themselves, are they, sir?
-That will be all.
-Right, sir.
Oh, Moss, I'm going to be up and down from London quite a bit.
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?
Well, you wouldn't want to stay in the lodgings you had last time then, sir, eh?
Too many bad memories, I suppose.
You should understand, Moss,
I have no regrets about my previous mission in this city.
No, sir?
(CHUCKLING) I imagine you boys have quite a laugh at my expense.
A laugh, sir?
You think it's funny that I developed feelings?
No idea what you're talking about, sir.
I have no regrets about what happened with Miss Burgess.
No "bad memories".
Right, sir.
He's losing his bloody mind.
Next.
ARTHUR:
All right, then.
Name?
The Digbeth Kid.
The Dig...
What are you?
A boxer?
Digbeth Kid like Billy the Kid.
Spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?
Cowboy pictures?
Tom Mix?
Yeah?
ARTHUR:
What are you...
Wait, wait.
It's not a real gun.
-Let's have a look then, eh?
-It's made of wood.
(CHUCKLING)
Bang.
Bang.
Very nice.
Where did you get the gun belt?
My sister made it out of an old blacksmith's apron.
My mum did most of the stitching.
She's not my real mum, but...
She does what mothers do.
So she made you a gun belt.
All right then, mother's boy.
There's the door.
On you go.
We're looking for...
Have you ever been arrested?
-Yeah.
-Yeah?
-No.
-Good.
You're the first bloke we've had in here today with no criminal record.
Arthur, we can stand him up.
Do you know what that means?
The new Home Secretary wants something done about illegal gambling.
Damn right.
About bloody time.
So we help our coppers make their quota of convictions by having men stood up to be arrested.
First offence, you'll get a week inside.
We'll give you five quid for your trouble.
How does that sound, cowboy?
Yeah.
Good.
Write your address down for Finn on your way out.
I can't write.
That's all right, Finn can't read.
Don't worry.
Just tell him your address and we'll send someone round.
If the sheriff don't run you out of town first.
(CHUCKLING)
Good man.
-Oh, I don't know, Tom.
Kids these days.
-Hmm.
They didn't fight.
So they're different.
They stay kids.
How was it?
I was starving, so I would have eaten anything.
But really it was super.
Super.
So, uh, are you a cook?
Not a cook.
No.
The man who came to the house, he was driving a posh car.
He looks rich.
What does he do?
-He works with horses.
-Really?
I love horses.
-I've got a bay mare.
-No!
I ride it all the time.
Then it's in the blood.
I've got about a million questions.
So do I.
I've had different pictures in my head.
Well, here I am.
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?
I don't have any choice.
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?
We don't choose.
And that's it.
Yeah, that's right.
God gave you to me.
People took you away.
And it is all right that it's me, isn't it?
In a place like this.
I thought it would be worse.
(CHUCKLING)
ARTHUR:
Run for the hills!
It's the Digbeth Kid!
Get out of town, kid, or I will shoot your fucking head off!
Time's up!
(MIMICS GUNSHOT)
- You're dead, go down.
- John!
All right then, Polly.
Who's this?
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.
Pleased to meet you.
John.
I'm Arthur.
You've already met me.
I used to throw you out of the window, so John could catch you.
I used to put you in a shoebox and kick you down Watery Lane.
I bet you're glad to be back.
I don't remember any of it.
All I remember is the day they took me away.
Well, you're here now, son.
Welcome to the Shelby family.
Later on, we'll show you the ropes.
Hmm.
Yeah, we'll show you what's what.
Let's leave him be for now, eh?
Come on, boys.
-Nice suit.
-(POLLY CHUCKLING)
They seem nice.
Here he is, Mr Inconspicuous.
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.
How are you feeling?
I've just come out of bandages myself.
Ready for active service.
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.
It's all right, Bill.
You don't have to stand in line for us.
It's men like you we're looking for, Billy.
But you have to pass the medical first.
Sheffield mob showed up at Wincanton trotting track.
I took a bullet.
When do the bandages come off?
When I take 'em off.
One week.
Not before.
You'll smell no rot.
There's no gangrene.
It's been a long time.
Eh, Billy?
What did you do with your medals?
Threw them in the cut.
Same as you.
It was never a hardship having you Black Country boys on our left flank.
And you Brummies did all right on our right.
Damn right.
I want you to be the head of a brigade, Bill.
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.
You'll have 1 00 men under your command.
And now we've got a member of the Kitchen family on the payroll, maybe your cousins and brothers will let our boats pass through the Black Country without being held up and robbed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Go home, Bill.
Round up any good men you can trust and put the word out.
Black Country boys and Brummie boys are on the same side again.
That'll be the bloody day.
Well, this is the bloody day.
London, man.
There for the taking.
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.
Polly said you had one in the pub.
All right, be quick.
I have business.
Sir.
Polly said you own this place.
She said you own lots of different businesses.
You call her Polly or Mum?
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.
(TOMMY SIGHING)
Who are you calling?
My mother.
I mean...
I know what you mean.
And what are you going to tell her?
I'm going to tell her where I am.
And now you're going to tell her you're going home.
Polly said I could stay for a few days.
-You want to stay?
-I've only just arrived.
What age are you Michael?
Seventeen.
Seventeen.
Which means it's not up to you, right?
I'm 1 8 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.
You smoke?
No.
Drink?
You're going to call your mother, going to tell her you're getting the next train home.
And when you get there, you're going to write a letter to Polly saying when you're 1 8, you'll come back here and sort things out.
I just told you.
I make up my own mind.
Do you know what we do, Michael?
We, Shelbys.
Yes.
I think I know what you do.
Yeah.
You've got smart eyes.
But you're young, so you think what we do is all right.
It's not all right.
People get hurt.
Now, call your mother and I will drive you to the station.
No.
In my village, there's this little wishing well.
It's made of white bricks, right in the middle of the village green.
Everybody says how pretty it is.
But I swear to God, if I spend another day in that village,
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.
Probably blow my hands off with it, but it'd be worth it.
Just to see all those pretty white bricks spread over the pretty village green.
Hmm.
Yep.
You're Polly's son, all right.
All right boys, let's go to work.
Let's be having it!
Don't wait!
Keep it moving.
Move!
Next lad!
Name?
Abbey Heath.
Abbey Heath.
Profession?
Baker.
Good lad.
Fill it out and fuck off.
Next lad!
Name?
Buddy Halls.
Buddy Halls.
Right.
Profession?
Baker.
Good lad.
Fill it out and fuck off.
Next lad!
-Name?
-Billy Kitchen.
Billy Kitchen.
Occupation?
Head baker.
Fill it out.
Um, Tommy Shelby, mate.
Never give power to the big man, what did I tell you?
Hmm?
Never give power to the big man.
Next lad!
Name?
All right, boys, you've now all been enrolled as bakers in the Aerated Bread Company of Camden Town.
If anyone asks, that's what you do.
You're bakers.
The coppers in Camden Town are on our side, but north or south, you show them that piece of paper.
Tell them you've come down from north to find work, to break strikes.
Tell them you're fascists, if you have to.
We're finding lodgings for you, but for now you'll sleep here in the bakery.
But don't touch any of the bread, it'll most likely explode.
Any questions?
Yes?
I haven't even seen any bread.
(EVERYONE LAUGHING)
(CLEARING THROAT)
He'll wake up.
Granted, he won't have any teeth left, but he will be a wiser man for it.
And the last thing he will remember is your funny little joke.
Won't he?
Right!
There are fucking rules here.
Yeah, there are fucking rules for a fucking reason.
Quite simply, they have to be obeyed.
All right?
Rule number one.
The distinction between bread and rum, yeah, is not discussed.
Rule number two.
Anything, right, that your superior officer says to you or any of your other fucking superior officers say to you, yeah?
Not discussed!
Rule number three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, I don't care.
For the rest of your fucking miserable measly lives, yeah?
Because I, like you, am also a complete fucking sodomite.
Jewish women.
You do not go anywhere near them because Jewish women for you are off the fucking menu.
I think that's fair.
Hmm.
All right, that's it, yeah.
Forgive me, I interrupted you.
Pick him up.
Get them out of here and make this fucking work.
Don't fucking wait!
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!
You're a fucking disgrace!
Go!
(CHUCKLING)
You've got a key?
I kept a spare.
Give it to me.
Could do with some paint, eh?
Yeah, when I decide.
What is it that you want, Tommy?
Just came by to say hello.
Tommy Shelby never goes anywhere for no reason.
(SIGHING) Fine.
I've got 800 pounds left in the Shelby property fund, and I need someone down here to look for suitable properties.
To rent?
Yes.
To poor people.
Ten to a room.
No repairs, no water.
And if they complain, you just send Arthur and the boys round.
You know, I give advice down at the library.
Families thrown on the street.
It's men like you we're fighting.
Well, anyway, I was just passing.
Thanks for the tea.
Tommy.
There are always men outside watching the house.
Yeah.
Gangsters of the worst kind.
But they're there to keep you safe.
No there are others.
They look like coppers.
Well, they're on your side as well.
I don't have a fucking side.
Ada, yes, you do.
And, anyway, if I thought there was no-one watching the house,
I couldn't sleep.
(SIGHING) Cheerio then.
POLLY:
That was great.
Well done.
Out we get then.
This house is mine.
I've taken on a maid.
She's made up the big room for you.
Come on, let's have a look.
I thought we could spend the week here.
You know, get to know each other again.
I've got ham.
Do you like ham?
I like ham, yes.
-I've got a maid...
-Yes, you said.
She's upstairs.
She can give us some tea.
Look, I ring this bell.
Watch.
(BELL RINGING)
Yes, madam?
I think we'd like some tea.
You get used to it.
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.
I'm not a cleaner.
But I have come to clean away some dirt.
Why don't you put that away before it goes off?
You killed my son!
You Peaky bastard!
You beat him and beat him and beat him.
Your son was a boxer.
No!
He was a boy who got into a ring with an animal.
Yeah, ain't that the truth.
I've come to stop you because the coppers and nobody else will.
If you're going to use it, point that thing at my head.
That's where the trouble is.
Gut-shot soldiers take half a day to die.
I've seen 'em.
Walking around with their guts in their arms like dirty washing.
Hold that gun up and do it!
Fucking do it!
Do it!
I'm going to finish my drink.
You can finish it with me, if you like.
(GUNSHOT FIRING)
(CRYING)
Now, look.
Look at me.
We've got a fund.
For you.
You'll get paid weekly.
I know it won't bring back your son.
I know that.
You have other sons.
You do.
And we'll find them work.
And you won't have to work.
-You'll be...
-(SCREAMING)
(CRYING) Somebody has got to stop you people.
Who broke the fucking mirror?
Seven years' bad luck, that is.
TOMMY:
There'll be another four boatloads tomorrow.
What's up, Charlie?
Business is good.
This isn't business, this is bloody work.
Cigarettes and booze is all right, but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.
I'm not even sure it's stolen.
Some of it is legally purchased.
One day, all of it will be.
It's like having a fucking job.
Hey!
Easy with them fan belts.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.
Done.
You don't even fight me any more.
And it's no sport getting through the Black Country with this truce.
They just fucking wave at you from the bank.
Well, just wave back, eh?
And all these fucking cars.
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-Uh.
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.
Major Campbell.
Beg pardon?
It doesn't matter.
Are there any other Irishmen lodging in this house?
No, Mr Campbell, I keep a respectable house.
With your special exception, I have no Irish here.
Well, let me know if any come enquiring after rooms.
Even if you turn them away, let me know, would you?
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.
They only said you was a policeman of some sort.
No.
I'm not expecting any trouble.
Is there a cafe nearby that serves chops?
Lamb or pork?
There is a chophouse two streets away.
But I myself serve sandwiches.
Egg and cress, or ham.
Or anything that pleases you.
No.
No.
No.
I, I think I'll go out and get some air.
Our scheduled meeting is not until Sunday.
I decided to bring it forward.
(CLEARS THROAT)
You just wanted to show me that you know where I live, isn't that it?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
You know, Mr Churchill was impressed.
Yes, he was.
All my demands have been met.
Did he tell you?
Yes.
Yes.
We had a meeting and your letter was read aloud.
As a matter of fact, there was quite a lot of hilarity at the meeting.
-The gentlemen all found it quite funny.
-(CHUCKLES)
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the gentlemen sometimes find you funny?
We will discuss our business on Sunday, on the agreed day, at the allotted time, and at the place that has already been determined.
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.
(CLEARS THROAT) There was another reason I came to see you tonight.
I just didn't want you to be made a fool of, is all.
The lodgings chosen for you by the police department, how shall I put this?
Well, your landlady used to run the most famous whorehouse in Stechford.
She's only semi-retired.
I bet the gentlemen would find that funny, eh?
Told to you in the spirit of friendship and co-operation.
See you Sunday!
-Name?
-Digbeth Kid.
Your real name.
Harold Hancox.
Profession?
Illegal bookmaker.
You don't admit that.
You say something like, "Umbrella mender".
And then we decide you're lying and then we arrest you.
Umbrella mender.
You were found in possession of betting slips, race cards and ticker tape.
Any explanation?
No.
"No.
"I have no explanation
"for my possession of those items, officer."
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.
Come on, son.
Bloody hellfire.
You've killed him, huh?
As I've explained, he's not easy to get at.
He's got an army round him.
But when the time is right...
The time is right.
It's right now.
When he's away from his familiar territory, I will take him.
-So what do you want?
-We heard from a guard at Winson Green prison that one of their bookies has just been put inside.
Kid called Harold Hancox.
We could make a point.
How many bakers is there in Camden Town now?
There are a lot of bakers in Camden Town, Mr Sabini, but, as I have said, we don't as yet have a definite number.
Who won the 4:1 5 at Chepstow?
-Ragman.
-(DARBY SNIFFS)
-Where's my dry cleaning?
-It's been collected.
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?
-What?
You don't know?
-I can find out.
No need.
I know already.
You see, the favourites, they're all winning.
And the second favourites are being done.
He's bewitching them.
Bewitching?
Gypsy stuff.
Herbs, potions.
And he's tipping off our big punters, so they know who's going to win.
Regular customers betraying us for profit.
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see,
comes before race, creed, family.
Results look normal to me.
You see shit!
Mr Sabini, if you think they're planning to fix Northern races, we'll take no more bets on anything north of Towcester.
-I gave you a job already.
-And the job will be done.
-But meantime...
-Meantime, fuck!
Meantime, what do you want us to do about the kid in the cage in Birmingham?
Why would you want me to say that out loud?
Is there somebody listening?
(HOARSELY) All right, I'll say it.
We'll kill the Hancox kid to send a message.
Good, and then you deal with Tommy fucking Shelby.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
You wanted to see me?
Aye.
Take off your clothes.
I know what you are.
So, take off your clothes.
Not done in a very gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.
Indeed not.
So it's true.
Stop.
I only wanted proof.
Not satisfaction.
Or indeed infection.
Are you in on the joke?
What joke?
I have unfinished business in this filthy city.
And when the time comes, I will finish that business.
And then my wrath will come down on all of youse.
-(GASPS)
-But now, tell your friends in the police station that I know.
And when my judgement comes,
I'll be the one that's laughing.
Get out.
(LOUD THUDDING)
On the right.
On the right.
We haven't got all night.
Come on!
Let's be having you, Watkins, in there on the right.
On the right!
Come on, boys!
Harold Hancox?
(GRUNTING)
Tell everybody, this is what happens to Blinders who come into the Green from now on.
Orders of Sabini.
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not a Blinder.
I've been stood up.
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
I'm not real!
This had better be good to interrupt my holiday.
Where's the boy?
In the back room.
I only brought him because afterwards we're going to the museum.
-He wanted to come in and say hello...
-Shut up, John.
There is nothing of interest to Michael in this room.
Tommy, get on with it.
Last night, one of our men had his throat cut in Winson Green.
This morning, I had a telegram saying it was Sabini who ordered it.
And it says here that Thomas Shelby's next.
If our men think we can't look after them in prison, they'll not work for us.
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.
Scudboat, you and one of the boys break a couple of windows, get yourselves arrested.
I'll have our coppers get you into the Green and you can find the bastards who did it.
Instead of breaking a window, can we pinch a car?
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.
-I'm still on a donkey.
-(CHUCKLING)
All right, just get yourselves fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.
And before you all laugh, a boy is dead.
He was just a kid.
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.
Agreed.
So is that it?
Can I go now?
Well, as company treasurer,
I need your permission to spend 1 ,000 guineas.
On what?
On a horse.
A thousand guineas on a horse?
That's right.
When was this decided?
You've been busy with Michael.
Oh, my God.
So, in the absence of common sense, you boys have had an idea.
Polly, there's a thoroughbred, quarter-Arab filly up for auction at the Doncaster Bloodstock.
What do we want with a 1 ,000-guinea horse?
When we make our move on Sabini's racing pitches, any men we get into the betting enclosure will be lifted by Sabini's police.
A good racehorse is a passport to the owner's enclosure.
We'll be in there with all the toffs.
-Coppers won't know where to look.
-Hmm.
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.
We'll be drinking with the bloody king.
The Derby?
Did he say the Derby?
That's right. (CLEARS THROAT)
For the last 1 0 years, Sabini's made it his race.
If we're going to take him down, might as well make it there, as a symbol.
Did you come up with this idea in a pub by any chance?
Pol.
A good racehorse is an investment, like property.
We need to diversify the portfolio.
So when is this sale?
Tomorrow.
Tommy's had a death threat, so we'll have to go with him for protection.
POLLY:
So, you're going to close up the shop, go out on a piss-up and blow 1 ,000 guineas on a horse that's not even whole Arab.
CURLY: (LAUGHING) Quarter-Arab is better!
-Quarter-Arab, it means...
-Curly, shut up.
I thought I told you to lock that door.
He did.
I used the key on the nail.
Look, I've been listening.
-I want to go with them.
-You see?
I love horses.
I could even help.
Over my dead body!
It'll be all right, Mum.
I've been to loads of horse auctions before with my uncle.
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.
Yeah, and their posh wives!
And their mistresses.
ARTHUR:
Let him come, Polly.
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.
I'll drop him back at the house in Sutton before it gets dark.
No.
Fucking no!
All right, that's it.
Back to work.
Come on!
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,
I'd killed 1 00 men and seen 1 ,000 die.
If you want to scare that kid away forever, carry on how you're going.
If you want him to stay, let him come.
MICHAEL:
I can't believe it.
AllJohn's old things fit me.
Christ, you look like your father.
Shrimp, ham.
What was he like?
My dad?
How did he die?
Well, I won't lie to you.
He died drunk, squeezed between a boat and a lock.
A real river gypsy's death.
But he could sing, play the piano...
His smile would break your heart.
You've got his same beautiful eyes.
When he was sober, he was kind and gentle.
His trouble was, he fell in with the wrong crowd when he was a boy.
(CAR HORN HONKING)
I have told them not to blow that horn.
(SHOUTING) This is a respectable fucking neighbourhood!
-(HISSING) -(ENGINE DYING)
-She's heating up, Curly.
Take a look.
-Yeah.
Let me out for a piss.
She made loads.
Do you want one?
What the bloody hell's that?
Sandwiches.
Ham, I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.
There's tea, but we'll have to take turns 'cause there's only one cup.
What?
Sandwiches?
-Yeah.
-Polly made bloody sandwiches?
What's this?
Teddy bear's fucking picnic?
(CLEARS THROAT) All right.
We will drink the tea and we will eat the sandwiches and then we will drive on.
All right?
No crumbs, Charlie.
-Hand them over.
-Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard.
-Fuck off.
-John, come on!
TOMMY:
All right, lads, this is a respectable event and we will all behave accordingly.
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.
When the horse comes up, I will do the bidding.
I've already registered my interest with the auctioneer.
So he knows to expect my bids.
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.
It's all right, Curly.
You're just in an unfamiliar place, we all are.
-I get feelings sometimes, Tommy.
-It's all right, Curly.
It's all right.
ARTHUR:
Shut up, Curly.
AUCTIONEER:
Do I hear 1 ,450?
Do I hear 500, 500, 1 ,600, 1 ,700?
Thank you.
1 ,900, 2,000, 2,1 00, 2,200...
Why do people come late to these things?
Hmm?
People come late 'cause they know what they want.
It's only you who needs to see every horse.
AUCTIONEER:
Am I bid?
2,600.
I am bid!
Sold!
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud, by Tetrarch out of LadyJosephine.
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.
All right, Tommy, this is her.
Do I hear 800 guineas?
850?
850.
Do I hear nine?
Do I hear nine?
Nine, am I bid?
Bid for this one.
The grey?
Why?
-He's beautiful.
-It's a filly.
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.
1 ,000.
Do I hear 1 ,050?
1 ,1 00?
1 ,200?
Do I hear 250?
250.
I'll go halves with you from the spring fund.
Go, go.
1 ,300?
1 ,400?
Do I hear five?
1 ,500.
1 ,600.
Do I hear seven?
1 ,700.
Thank you.
That's it, Tom, you have to stop.
You don't have it in your belt.
Yes, I do.
I'm having the horse.
CURLY:
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But, stop, I tell you.
-I feel something bad!
-Shut up, Curly!
2,000.
Do I hear 2,050?
2,050.
Am I bid?
-2,050...
-Enough!
Billy could use one of my geldings.
2,000, I am bid.
Do I hear 2,050?
Last time.
2,050?
Sold!
To Mr...
Thomas Shelby.
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,
Small Heath.
-What kind of premises?
-Boat yard.
Yachts?
Canals.
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?
Import, export.
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes.
You beat us to it.
Did I?
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.
-Sorry.
-Thomas Shelby from where?
From Birmingham.
Goodness!
No, not much.
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.
What is it you do?
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.
ARTHUR:
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!
Well, before you go, if you ever decide to put that filly out,
-I'd be interested in having her.
-I plan to race her.
-Do you have a trainer?
-I know people.
-I know people, too.
-Tommy!
We've got to get this kid back before dark or Polly will have your balls!
She will have 'em!
We know different people, I would guess.
My father knows Mick Hancock.
-Trained three Ascot winners.
-Oh, so that was your father?
Yes.
We're joint-owners of the stud.
He took the majority share when my husband was killed.
Ypres.
ARTHUR:
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!
The chickens are hungry!
(SNICKERING)
So will you consider me?
I will consider you.
You still didn't tell me what you do.
Oh!
I do bad things.
But you already know that.
ARTHUR:
Right, about bloody time!
(MEN SNICKERING)
It's the fucking truth, John boy.
Rich women these days, all they want is working-class cock.
Tommy, maybe she was the something bad I had the feeling about!
Ah!
She looks all right to me, Curly!
ARTHUR:
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.
Yeah, by us.
All I'll say is she has good contacts in the racing world.
Here, Michael, you drive.
Thomas Shelby?
-Tommy!
-(GUNSHOT)
-Tommy!
Down!
-(GUNSHOT)
Tommy Shelby?
How about fucking Arthur?
Fucking good to meet you.
Get him off him!
Arthur!
Arthur!
Get him off him!
Come on.
Stop it, Arthur.
Get him off.
Arthur, that's enough.
Arthur, come on!
Come on, Arthur, come on.
That's it.
It's over.
Arthur!
Come on, shut up.
Come on, come on.
He's still breathing.
Don't get blood on the kid!
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?
Give me the keys.
Michael, give me the keys.
I'm all right to drive.
All right.
Go on.
Go on, go on!
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!
-Right, let's get out of here, sharpish.
-Come on!
(DOOR OPENING)
(DOOR CLOSING)
So?
How'd it go?
Well, it was cold in the van, but it was super.
Really.
Let me smell your breath.
(EXHALES)
Did they behave themselves?
They were amazing, Mum.
They were really amazing.
(SIGHS)
Would you look who it is?
Leave me alone.
You are alone, which is strange.
Yeah, where's your little friend?
Oh, wait.
That's right.
I saw you two this morning, and you weren't talking.
You guys get in a fight or something?
Oh, she got in a fight, and now she has no friends.
Boo hoo.
Leave me alone, or I'll lose one of my drill bits in your ear.
I know what you need.
You need new friends, friends like us.
I'd rather be fed to zombies.
But you love zombies, so you would love us.
Just like Sophie, Katie, and me, a panther you shall be.
Why am I wearing this outfit?
(Gasps) And these shoes?
Get me out of these, stat.
Oh, no!
No.
I'm...
I'm hideous.
Did it work?
Seems like it.
Who dressed me this morning?
A 12-year-old boy?
Anybody have any spare outfits I can borrow?
I have tons of clothes in my locker.
Eight extra outfits, one for every day of the week.
Great.
Let's go.
Come on, Maddie.
Move it, stat.
"Stat" is my thing.
Who's this, your new boyfriend?
I wish.
No, he's...
He's my cousin from France, yeah.
Speaks no English.
Now let's go get you decent.
And discuss how to destroy Emma.
Oh, we're gonna be great friends.

Sounds fun.
Hello, Diego.
Eaten any canned eyes lately?
Did you say kanay?
Yes, canned eye.
Canned-eye peas.
Close relative of black-eyed peas.
They're today's special.
Oh, okay, great.
Well, in that case, I love peas...
Black-eyed peas, plain old peas, peas in my pasta, peas in my potpie.
Enough pea talk.
Get back to class.
You're gonna be late.
Ah!
Hey, you left your...

Ugh!
Children.
When I get the chosen one's powers, my first order of business is gonna be to eliminate them, all of them.
(Sniffs)
Nurse Lily.
How can I help you?
Just getting a bottle of water.
Allow me.
(Sniffs)
Smells funny in here, doesn't it?
Well, we do have a lot of 13-year-old boys with some serious hygiene issues.
They think soap, shampoo, and showers are optional.
They're all useless nuisances getting in our way.
Wow.
That's surprising, coming from a principal.
Sorry.
I, um...
(Gasps) Miss pitch?
Oh, no.
Are all those frogs in there people?
(Croaks)
Well, I better get hopping.
I mean going.
Looking this good takes time.
You look...
Amazing!
Of course I do.
Lip gloss.
Here.
Smoothie.
Sophie's on her way.
I'll call her and...
I'm here!
I'm here!
Where's mine?
Oh, I only had time to get one.
What?
Chill out, Maddie.
I mean, you're a witch, aren't you?
Just make one appear.
Now, listen up, girls.
As panthers, we rule the school.
Everyone should love us and be scared of us at all times.
She's right.
I love panther Andi.
Mac, I've been looking for you.
For me?
Really?
Yeah.
I need you to help me with my new friend, beau.
He's a Liz...
I mean...
"" Sophie, make sure you say he is my cousin from France.
Don't mess up.
Maddie."
So he's "Maddie's cousin from France"?
"Yes."
And I thought about who's the most "like him,"
and you were the "obvious choice."
Of course.
I'll hang out with him.
Great!
Beau, this is...
Where'd he go?
I could have sworn he was right behind you a second ago.
Beau, you are going to hang out with Mac and do normal boy stuff.

♪
Andi?
Andi, what, uh...
What is it, Emma?
Black cat got your tongue?
What are you doing?
She's with us now.
That's right.
I'm a panther now and forever.
(Girls giggling)
Andi, what...
Did Maddie do this?
This has to be a spell.
It's not.
I can undo this.
Yeah, right.
You don't even have the Hexerin, and you've barely practiced.
But I...
When the eclipse comes,
Maddie is gonna Jack all your powers.
That's why I need your help!
Let me spell it out for you.
You and me, not friends anymore.
That'll teach you not to mess with me.
When I defend my powers and become the chosen one for good,
I'm going to confiscate your powers until you learn to play fair and not hurt other people.
That's it?
Ooh, I'm shaking in my designer wedges.
You're so mean!
And another great comeback from Emma.
(Laughs)
Ugh!
I have got to learn how to make my anger appear scarier.
It's all starting to make sense.
There are two young witches here.
One of them may be the chosen one.
And to protect her, the council sends a guardian, the nurse.
You're right.
Does the council know about you?
Oh, they think they destroyed me a long time ago, took my powers and left me to rot in the human world.
But you still have powers.
And they didn't get all of them.
They left me just enough power to steal more power.
Well, that's quite an oversight.
Just because these witches are on the council doesn't mean they're all that bright.
If she's a guardian, I'll find out.
Oh, don't you worry.
I'll take it from here.
Yikes.
Andi as a panther is a little scary.
Tell me about it.
Emma, I know you care about her, but you've got bigger problems.
I know, but I need Andi.
She's my best friend, and I'm not leaving her behind.
That's a little dramatic.
But it'll do.
So will you train me?
Only if you're all in.
We don't have a lot of time, and I'd rather not be around to see you go down in flames.
I'll defeat Maddie.
Maddie's not our biggest problem anymore.
There's another witch, the principal.
First order of business, new cheers, and then...
No.
Okay, first order of business, Saturday's beach ball.
Okay, does everybody have dates?
I do.
That are not reptiles.
(Sighs)
I see we all have our work cut out for us.
Let's make a list of guys and...
How about instead we make a list of Emma's weaknesses and then devise a plan to steal her powers during the eclipse?
Daniel says you're great at making plans.
It's one of your many great qualities.
I am.
It's true.
And you know Emma best, so you're my...
I mean, our best weapon.
Oh!
Get a pen and paper.
I dictate.
You write.
Oh, what a cool-looking trunk.
What do you keep in here?
Don't open it!
Step away.
Nobody opens my trunk.
Oh!
"Don't touch my trunk.
That's where I keep my Hexerin and all my magic stuff."
No, I don't!
Why are you so interested in the hex-a-gram anyway?
So you can cast some spells and we can have some fun.
- I'm in.
- Me too.
Now get the Hexerin, and let's get our cray-cray on.
I don't know what that means.
It means we're gonna conjure up some serious crazy here.
Yes!
Andi's right.
You never conjured any real cray-cray for us.
Fine.
Let's conjure up some serious cray.
Yay!
Let's try something easy.
Which one first, Andi?
(Sighs)
It's past its prime.
It's sung its tune.
So turn this flower into a spoon.
Whoa.
As Andi would say, "that was way pitiful, dude."
It's kind of drab and faded from the sun.
Make this couch look a bit more fun.
Close enough!
(Laughs)
(Doorbell rings)
Hey, Tony.
What are you doing here?
Well, you looked a little upset at school, so I brought over my favorite sudoku books.
Oh.
That's thoughtful of you.
Uh, come on in.
Re-decorating?
You could say that.
- So are you practicing magic?
- Trying.
Well, that's how you become a great magician.
You practice, practice, practice, and when you think you can't practice anymore...
Keep practicing.
Actually, have a ham sandwich.
Then you keep practicing.
I'll keep that in mind.
So you need any help?
I don't know.
(Sighs)
Hi, coach.
Dude, you parked far away from everything.
So no one will see you here.
We have a lot to work on, so let's get started.
Yes, sir!
Hey, I'm serious.
I'm already risking enough doing this.
Are you ready?
Yeah, but I don't really understand the whole kanay thing.
Right now, the most important thing for you to know is to stay away from witches.
(Scoffs) Witches?
Well, that'll be easy, because they don't exist.
Okay, we have a lot more work to do than I thought.
Let's start simple, a fireball.
Can you really, really conce...
Whoa.
Like that?
So I just shimmy this way and turn that way.
And...
Ta-da!
Do you want some help?
Uh, no, no, I got this.
I'm stepping in.
He couldn't get out in a snap, so release Tony from his trap.
Emma!
That was great!
You cast a spell at the spur of the moment, and it worked perfectly!
You must work well under pressure.
You know what?
I do!
Like when I turned monkey-Lily back into human-Lily at the last second.
You're right!
Aren't you glad you didn't erase my memory?
Yes, and you're doing a great job acting like you don't know.
So what's next?
I...
Magically untie these knots while under pressure from you chasing me around the house?
Mm... (Upbeat pop music)

Oh.
(Stammering)
Oh, hey, mom. (Laughs nervously)
What's up?
So what do we do now?
Go after Andi?
I want to, but I don't know if she's still mad at me.
I don't want to make things worse between us.
How could it be worse than her being a panther?
You're right.
I have to save her and get the Hexerin back.
That's the book full of all the awesome magic tricks, isn't it?
Uh, something like that.
Maddie stole it from me.
Maddie's holding Andi and the Hexerin hostage?
Yes.
I've got to get both out of her house, and I have no clue how.
Just leave that to me.
Come on;
I'm going to the pool, and you and lieutenant oddball aren't staying here by yourselves.
Why so grumpy?
Is it because Emma's going to beach ball with Tony?
No.
And how do you know?
Miss information.
Is there anyone who doesn't follow her?
You know what to do, right?
Ask Maddie to beach ball to make Emma jealous.
Why?
I don't want to do that.
Trust me.
It's fool-proof.
Hi, Mrs. van pelt.
Hi, Tommy.
It's Tony.
Is Maddie home?
I'm here to work on our science project.
We don't have a science project due.
Yeah, we do.
(Banging noise) What was that?
Uh, just the supplies rattling around.
(Banging noise)
I'll be the judge of that.
Told you.
"Told you.
Now I'm gonna tell my mommy on you."
(Girls laughs)
Hey!
Oh, sorry. (Laughs)
Sometimes the wheels get a little bit wonky.
I still don't remember having a project due.
Maybe the biology teacher assigned it the day you skipped class...
Sophie, stitch it!
Well, the good thing about being paired up with Tony is that he's crazy smart.
Wow.
Thanks, Andi.
And he'll do the entire project on his own and get you both "a" s.
Uh, no.
Maddie?
You'll be doing the project with Timmy here.
Tony.
And you'll get "a" s based on the work you do together.
Hmm!
♪ Yeah ♪
You'll want this back later.
Each pair had to pick at least two ecosystems.
I picked rainforest, coral reef, arctic tundra, redwood forest, and underwater cave.
What?
You were only supposed to pick two!
No, at least two. (Laughs)
Are there any even left?
Oh, sure there is:
Alpine tundra, aquatic estuaries, snow desert, underwater snow desert, underwater desert, you know, which some people don't think they exist, but they actually exist.
They exist.
Trust me.
And then there's urban.
There's skies.
There's underwater caves.
- All those too?
- No.
There's...
I'm just explaining how... what we could have picked, but I picked the easy ones for you.
Like, underwater cave?
It's like, boom, you're done.
There you are!
I knew it!
Something didn't smell right about all of this, and it's you.
Andi.
I don't know what Maddie did, but this isn't you.
Yes, it is.
This is the real me.
Andi, the true Andi, I know she's in there.
Come on out!
What are you gonna do?
Cast a spell?
You're so rusty, you probably can't even do them anymore.
She's not a panther, a fairy, or an elf.
Turn Andi into her old self.
Oh, no, you didn't!
Maddie!
Did you hear that?
Yes.
It was my stomach growling.
It came from upstairs.
Uh, wait!
Andi?
Em?
Why am I wearing a costume?
Are you... you?
Why are we in Maddie's room?
Maddie turned you into a panther.
Ugh!
And you snuck in to save me?
Yeah, and to get this.
The hex!
You found it!
Yup, but listen.
We need to get out of here.
Maddie's on her way up.
The window!
High heels?
They were torturing me?
(Footsteps)
She's coming!
This better be good, Andi.
You know how extra walking for no good reason frustrates me.
What are you doing up here?
Relaxing with my favorite magazine, teen vo-goo-ee.
So, uh, what are gonna do about that menace Emma?
Oh, I've got big plans for her.
We're gonna do so mu...
Why are you walking like that?
I think I got a corn on my toe.
Come on.
Let's go get a butter knife and cut it out.
Yes, let's.
And take this.
Here is.

When the situation is resolved, all of you will return home.
And now we issue certificates to those who successfully completed the training school.

Come to me.
Aim.
This is a great day for our institution.
Puchuritsa Harris, who came to us four and a half ago And before that grew in the forest, unable to join our team and to finish school first class.
Haris learned to read, write and talk.
I hope you continue to work hard and develop.
Congratulations.
Aleksandar Todorovic.

Lie down!
When Ruth and I first moved to Brooklyn, it was like an outpost.
To our friends in Manhattan, we might as well have moved to Nebraska.
It was out of fashion, but a good place for a struggling artist like me.
And we liked it, which was good, because it was all we could afford.
Morning, Mr. Rahim.
Good morning, Mr. Carver.
Good morning, Dorothy.
So tomorrow's the big day.
You ready to move?
I don't know.
I would get out of here in a minute if I could.
Ah.
Where would you go?
Where would I go?
New York is the best city in the world.
Hello.
Hello.
Ruth.
It's like talking to someone in the wreck of the Titanic.
Ruth!
Ruth.
Ruth.
Uh...
What am I looking for in here?
The Times.
Oh.
Um...
I'm losing you.
Alex, stop moving around.
Are you near the door?
Listen to me.
Yeah.
It's in the rack.
Oh!
Mmm-hmm.
Lily's coming, so I got to go.
Yeah, she's here.
So I'll talk to you later.
You'll be fine.
Honestly.
Aunt Ruth, I don't know how you and Alex do it.
I'm 40-whatever.
And look at me.
Jesus, I got to join a gym.
Uh...
Excuse me.
Where is The Times?
Aunt Ruth.
Hide this.
We're gonna see a lot of action tomorrow.
Your mother gave that to me.
Well...
I wish she hadn't smoked so much.
I guess people don't really give ashtrays as gifts anymore, do they?
I don't know if people even make them anymore.
So the shades all have to be up.
Light is money.
Remember that.
How many people will come, do you think?
Who knows?
But what we want are the serious ones.
Oh.
You always get the lookers.
The people who just come to see how other people live.
It makes them feel better about their lives.
Or worse.
Who knows?
So when you're trying to sell, you don't want any clutter.
Uh-huh.
Less is more.
All the books gotta go away.
Chekhov.
The Lady with the Dog.
This was my favorite story to teach.
Uh-huh.
The girls loved it, but I remember the boys not so much.
Did you get Uncle Alex to change his mind?
Oh, he's still on the fence about it, but you know artists.
Too much practicality overwhelms them.
Ah, I'll get him there.
Because you're looking at maybe a million dollars.
Give or take.
Oh.
Two years ago, it would have been even more.
It was a feeding frenzy then.
The neighborhood's changed a lot.
It's cool now, filled with hipsters.
And gentrifiers.
Mothers with baby strollers that cost as much as a Chevy.
And their banker husbands, their heads buried in their smart phones.
Crossing the street while you're trading stocks and bonds doesn't seem that smart to me.
Hey!
Hey!
Watch where you're going.
The neighborhood's just got itself a Whole Foods.
All it needs now is the ultimate sign of modern civilization.
An Apple Store.
But as much as it's changing, I'm gonna miss this place.
Come on, Dorothy.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Come on, now.
Come on.
That's a good girl.
Good morning, Mr. Carver.
Oh, hi, Erica.
Are you all ready for the open house?
I guess so.
It's not the same market it was a few years ago, you know?
Well, we're just testing the waters.
What you're gonna want to do tomorrow, first thing, when you wake up...
Mmm-hmm.
... turn this on and let it simmer.
It gives the whole apartment a homey feel.
Okay.
It works every time.
Let's hope a lot of people are gonna love this apartment tomorrow.
This is a young people's building.
You know?
The stairs.
Come on.
I know you're tired.
So am I. Come on.
I know.
Come on.
Here, let me try.
I know how to put a key in the door.
Give it here.
I got it.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm carrying my bride across the threshold.
What bride?
We've been married two years.
You still like it?
Like it?
I love it.
Oh, look at all this light.
Hi.
I'm Alex Carver.
My wife and I, we just moved in.
Oh, hey, Alex.
Hey.
Hey, Dorothy.
Did you have a good walk, sweetie?
Big day tomorrow.
You all set?
Yes.
What is that smell?
Oh, that's cinnamon.
It gives the place a homey feel.
It smells like a whorehouse.
Is that a fact?
Yes.
And what does a whorehouse smell like, sir?
Well, it smells like this.
Uh-huh.
So, uh, I'm gonna be bringing the first couple, the Schuylers, by at 9:00 a.m.
9:00 a.m. Why not 6:00?
Oh, come on, Alex, please, you promised.
So we could be getting a lot of people here tomorrow, and if you could tidy up your studio, it would be great.
Because it's such a wonderful room, but it looks smaller than it is with all the clutter.
Anyway.
That's great.
So it's gonna be great.
Good.
Thanks, Lily.
I can hardly wait.
Bye, Lily.
You could be nice to her.
She's done a lot of work for us, honey.
She talks too much.
Well, I can't disagree with that.
This room has been my studio for more than 40 years.
What room will I be painting in next year?
Will it have a view?
Will it even have a window?
I think these could go over here, honey.
All right, here, here.
Here, I'll take it.
I'll take it.
All right.
Are you okay?
Okay.
I got it.
Ruth.
What?
We're making a mistake.
What do you want me to do, Alex?
I mean, it's already in the paper.
I just don't want Lily to railroad us like she did her mother.
That's because Sarah was sick, please.
Where would we go?
Oh, I think...
Well, with a million dollars, frankly, we could go anywhere.
We might get a million dollars.
Anyway, it'll cost a million dollars to get another place like this.
Not to mention the cost of moving and selling.
Well, then we'll go where the houses are cheaper.
There's no way we can leave New York.
We're not going to leave New York.
No.
All we need is a place for you to paint and an elevator.
I handle the stairs better than Lily does.
Sure, you do now, honey, but...
What about later?
I don't know.
You know, I...
I've read about these open houses.
Uh-huh.
People steal things.
Okay, I will nail the furniture to the floor.
All right?
I don't like the idea of all those people in here poking through our things.
You don't have to be here.
You do not have to be here.
You can take a walk.
You can go see a movie.
Well, I might do that.
We're just dipping our toes into the water.
That's all.
Nobody's making any commitments.
Nobody.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What happened?
What's wrong?
Alex.
Something's wrong with Dorothy.
What?
What's the matter?
She's shaking.
I don't know.
She's shaking, and then when I picked her up she screamed.
What's the matter, girl?
She screamed.
I don't know, I think she's in pain.
Maybe we should take her to the vet.
It's probably nothing.
No.
Remember last year?
It cost us $700 to find out she had gas.
Don't try to go so fast, Ruth.
You don't want to fall down these steps.
I'm not gonna fall down.
She's shaking, because she's upset.
I think we could use an elevator.
Don't you?
At this point?
Well, I guess we could, but we don't have one.
What happened?
We think it's her back.
You want a cab?
Yeah.
Please, please.
Taxi!
Oh, thank God.
Is there a fire?
They say that there's a gasoline truck stuck on the Williamsburg Bridge.
Always something, isn't it?
Thank you, Mr. Rahim.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Good luck with the dog.
The tanker is blocking two lanes.
That's right, Brian.
All Manhattan-bound traffic is stuck right now...
Are they talking about the bridge?
Could you turn the music down, please?
Yeah.
Please.
Thank you.
... has jackknifed on the Williamsburg Bridge a few minutes ago.
The mayor made a statement urging people to avoid all but essential...
I still don't hear anything.
What?
Did you forget your hearing aid?
Some tanker's stuck on the bridge.
That's all I'm hearing.
Now, the mayor's telling people not to come into the city tonight.
Should we have taken the tunnel?
Nah.
No way.
Everything's a mess.
Hey...
What's with your dog?
You know, actually, we don't know.
Maybe he ate a plastic bag.
You know, my dog did that once.
He got real sick.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay, thank you.
There you go.
Keep the change.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
Here we go.
Hey, good luck with the dog.
You'll find out in the morning if she ate a bag.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
You've got it?
Yeah.
Do you want me to carry her?
No, no, I've got her.
It's okay, sweetie.
We're almost there.
Okay, sweetie.
Oh, my God.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I found her on the kitchen floor in her own urine.
And then when I picked her up she screamed.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, Dorothy.
Let's see what's going on here.
It's highly probable it's a ruptured disk, but we'll need to do a CAT scan to know for sure.
Yeah.
CAT scan?
Is that expensive?
Alex.
Alex.
I'm just asking, Ruth.
It's not cheap, Mr. Carver.
How much?
Around $1,000.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah...
Okay.
We should do this right away.
Yeah.
All right.
Good.
Okay, Dorothy.
Okay.
Okay, Dorothy.
Do you really think they can fix a ruptured disk?
Who knows?
We just have to be ready for the worst.
Don't say that, please, Alex.
She's 10 years old, Ruth.
I know.
But 10 is not that old.
You're older than her in dog years.
Oh, thanks.
The rupture is between T-13 and L-1.
It's about two-thirds down her spine.
Okay.
Usually, this type of injury is best with surgery.
What if you can't fix it?
Well, animals adapt very well to new challenges, Mrs. Carver.
I've seen dogs with paralysis live a full life with the use of wheels.
Wheels?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, look, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We'll keep her on the steroids.
And in the meantime, you should go home.
And we'll call you in the morning.
Okay?
Okay.
I just wish we didn't have to leave her here overnight, you know?
Try not to put yourself in her place.
Animals adapt to their fates more easily than we do.
They don't remember what was.
Right?
I...
Okay.
They deal with things as they are now.
Should we tell him how far we're willing to go?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
I mean, we have to be realistic, Ruth.
We can only spend so much.
And you heard what the doctor said.
Animals live in the now.
And it might not even be fair to Dorothy.
You might want to consider this.
Wait.
What?
I'll call you tomorrow.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry, but what is that?
This is a DNR.
Do Not Resuscitate.
What are you talking...
Wait a minute.
Oh!
Ruth.
No.
Why did you sign that form?
We have to be practical, Ruth.
But, Alex, it's not your decision to make.
We have to do everything we can for her.
And we will.
But what if there isn't anything we can do?
There's always something to do, Alex.
I just think it might be the kindest thing for her.
Yeah.
Why do you always assume...
Just let me ask you this.
Why do you always assume everything is gonna go wrong?
Because I plan for the worst and I hope for the best.
Oh, you think I don't know that after 40 years of marriage?
Insane.
We've had this same damn discussion for a thousand times.
It's not a discussion.
Don't tell me that.
It's not a discussion.
This is an argument, Alex.
All right.
Argument, discussion, whatever you want to call it.
I'm just doing what I think is right.
Okay, fine.
All right.
Fine, you do that.
But I'll tell you right now, it doesn't really matter, because I'm sure that Dorothy's gonna be fine.
There has been no movement at this point.
The driver appears to be missing.
The NYPD, well, they're not saying very much, but...
NYPD has released the identity of the suspect as Abdul Pamir.
We know who he is, but the real questions are, where is he?
What is he up to?
And why did he run away?
Did you take your pill?
Yes, love.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Thanks, Julie.
I've already spoken with some of the people who were on the bridge when the tanker jackknifed.
And they said their immediate concern was...
I'm going up to the roof.
Okay.
Do you see what I'm seeing?
Larry, no!
Happy retirement.
Thanks for nothing.
Yeah.
Wishful thinking.
Oh, my God!
This is embarrassing.
What are you doing, honey?
What is it?
Oh, God.
What is it going to be?
Thank you very much.
I love you.
Uh-oh.
That feels a little...
Wait.
There's something strange about this.
Something doesn't...
I don't know what's going on.
Oh, no, it is!
It's trouble!
It's trouble!
- It's trouble!
- Aw!
This is the trouble.
Oh, you're adorable.
What are we gonna name her?
What do you think?
I got it.
I know what.
Dorothy.
Yeah.
Dorothy.
You're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.
Look.
Oh, my God.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
I thought you were watching the news, honey.
Nothing new about it.
It's all the same old stuff over and over.
I know.
But I think people feel safer when they hear things.
Look at these.
What do you think?
Well, they're kind of puny, but we got tomatoes.
How many did we get last year?
Six?
Seven?
Eight.
Eight?
That works out to be about nine dollars apiece.
We could have gone to the Four Seasons for less than that.
I'm gonna go clean up.
Okay?
We can clean up tomorrow.
The people are coming tomorrow at 9:00, and Lily has given me a whole list of stuff that I have to do.
Nobody is going to be house hunting tomorrow.
We don't know that.
Would you buy an apartment this weekend?
You know, you're just as happy as you can be about all this bridge business, aren't you?
Well, of course, I planned this whole thing, so I could thwart Lily's open house tomorrow.
I wouldn't put it past you.
And, oh...
Don't forget you promised Lily you'd clean up your studio.
It looks like a mess, Alex.
Bomb detection unit is being brought on the scene with robots to check for such explosives in the tanker.
Now the bridge is swarming with NYPD.
We have unconfirmed reports that there may be some sort of explosive device in the gasoline tank.
So what about this bridge business, anyway?
Please, Aunt Ruth, I sold a loft in Tribeca the day after 9/11.
We might not get the usual hordes, but we'll get the serious ones and that'll work in our favor.
I will see you tomorrow at 8:30.
Good, okay, thank you.
... missing driver as Abdul Pamir.
Now, we can show you a picture from Pamir's social networking site.
Isn't that a traditional Muslim hat he's wearing?
Yeah, Brian.
It's actually referred to as a kufi...
Oh, Lily's coming by with the first couple at 8:30.
Nothing stands in the way of real estate.
What did Lily call this?
Clutter.
Who'd have thought that the whole of my life's work would be worth less than the room I painted it in.
But how can I turn down a million dollars?
I have nothing else to leave Ruth besides all this clutter.
Oh...
Come on.
Okay.
Oh!
There.
Yes?
Oh, hello, Doctor.
Yes, this is she.
Dorothy's stabilized, so I'd like to operate on her first thing in the morning to minimize distress.
Honey?
Yeah.
The Doctor wants to operate on her tomorrow morning.
Yeah, now, she has a heart murmur.
Yes.
Yes.
I see.
Yes, of course.
He says the longer we wait the more stress there is on her heart.
What are the odds if they operate?
What are her odds?
Around 60-40.
60-40?
In her favor?
There's no guarantees, but one can't be certain.
Oh.
So do you want to go ahead with this?
Well, yes, we do.
I should tell you that the operation will be at least $10,000.
$10,000?
Yes.
Oh, well, that's a lot of money.
I don't really know...
Here.
Let me talk to him.
Oh.
Okay.
Doctor?
This is Mr. Carver.
Hello?
Hello?
What's the matter?
Doesn't work.
Hello?
What?
Oh!
Oh.
Is anyone there?
Doctor, this is Mr. Carver.
Yes.
Listen.
I want you to do whatever is necessary to save Dorothy.
Never mind what I signed.
The money doesn't matter.
Okay.
Just do whatever it takes.
Will do.
What?
You know what.
It's a brand new day here at WZRZ.
Your place for New York talk.
Traffic is still snarled up on the Williamsburg Bridge.
We'll go out there with Cynthia Piermont soon.
But first, we have a studio full of newlyweds.
So we're learning now that the suspect, police source said,
Abdul Pamir is from Uzbekistan.
Hey.
Look at that.
What?
"Peril on the bridge!"
They make it sound like an amusement park ride or something.
Oh!
Several of Pamir's co-workers have come forward to say that he's a quiet, good-natured young man.
Who's screwing up the real estate market.
We're going now to Queens, where the family is about to make a statement.
Logan is reporting live from the scene.
Abdul Pamir is a devout, gentle and caring son.
Yes, he was born in Uzbekistan, but he became a proud American citizen two years ago.
All we want is for him to come home safe.
Hello.
This is Dr. Kramer, Mrs. Carver.
Oh, Dr. Kramer.
Uh...
Honey, honey.
It's Dr. Kramer.
The good news is Dorothy made it through the surgery fine.
But when she was waking up, she had a seizure.
A seizure?
It concerns me.
You have to keep in mind she's not a puppy.
Now, the anesthesia should wear off in the next couple of hours.
And I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
All right?
Thank you, Doctor.
Hey...
I mean, that's not good news.
Oh.
Okay.
Turn off the TV, honey.
Okay.
I don't want to see them.
Then go hide.
Good morning!
Hello.
Good morning.
These are the Schuylers.
This is Mrs. Carver.
Oh, please.
Call me Ruth.
Ruth.
I'm Jenny.
Well, good.
It's good to see you.
Come on in.
Where's Dorothy?
Well, she's recovering from surgery and...
Well, you know, you can have pets.
We don't do pets.
So do you see how the hallway expands the sense of space?
And would you look at the size of the kitchen.
You've got light coming from both directions.
You practically have to wear sunglasses when you have breakfast in here.
It's so bright.
So the master bedroom is this way.
Master.
Hello.
Yeah.
Oh, we're looking at some place.
Reminds me of my grandmother's.
I know.
Who's gonna buy a place with the shit that's going on out there now?
So this is the laundry room.
Right.
And this is a really large hall closet.
I love the plank floors.
I always hated the parquet floors in our East Side place.
Uh-huh.
Who came up with the idea of parquet, anyway?
I don't know.
It's like walking on a board game.
I know.
This is the bathroom.
Only one?
I told you that, honey.
Jesus.
Yeah.
I'm listening.
The second bedroom.
Sorry.
Oh, hello.
Oh, this is my husband's studio.
And I'm her husband in his studio.
How do you do?
Yeah, hold on a second.
Oh, isn't this an amazing view, honey?
Yeah, it's good.
It could be a nursery.
Or a screening room.
She's right, honey.
There'd be a lot of room in here once we got all this stuff out.
No, I told you we weren't doing that.
Does anybody listen to me?
My husband is in the financial sector.
Oh.
Was.
Is.
We've had a rough couple of years.
That's why we had to sell our duplex uptown.
It's all right.
'Cause our therapist says we need to lower our expectations.
She said it'll be healthy for us.
It'd be good karma to live in a place like this.
Because we don't really need all that much.
I mean, who does, right?
Right.
You could always go live in a cardboard box under the bridge.
This street is very sought after.
Thank you for letting us see it first.
Please.
My pleasure.
Shall I show you out?
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
That was a good start.
Yeah, well, the others are gonna be better.
Couldn't be worse.
Stop.
Honey.
So there's good news, and there's bad news.
Okay.
Um...
They liked the apartment, or at least she does...
Ooh!
... which is usually what matters.
They love the neighborhood...
Mmm-hmm.
... but they're a little worried about the stuff on the bridge.
No.
But it's gonna be over in a week.
Yeah.
That's what I told them, but they said if it happens once...
What's happening?
... that there is no bomb in the tanker.
However, police have not yet ruled out the idea that the suspect may be armed.
Are they still saying this guy is a terrorist?
They don't really know.
If you see something, say something today on this day, years after 9/11.
Ah!
Next couple.
Hi.
Come on up.
Does he have a device with him?
Is he wearing a suicide vest?
We, of course, have more questions than answers.
Great.
My God.
It is true, though, Brian, that nothing is being ruled out until they find the suspect.
Of course, we can't confirm if there is actually a bomb.
Then why do you keep talking about it?
'Cause they make shit up as they go along.
That's why.
Oh!
Okay.
Okay.
Coming, coming, coming.
Okay.
Here we go.
Good news.
There is no bomb in the tanker.
Did they catch the driver?
No, not yet.
Mrs. Carver?
Yes.
And what's the name of your dog?
This is Harold.
Can I pet Harold?
No.
No, no!
He's wearing a vest.
Sorry.
He's in training to be a seeing eye dog.
He's still learning the difference between work and play.
Oh, Mrs. Carver, I'm Annie.
Annie Meyer.
Hello.
Well, you know, we have a dog.
He's not here now.
Well, no.
She's in the hospital.
She's recovering from surgery.
Oh, n...
Oh!
Whoa!
Harold, Harold!
Stop, Harold.
Heel!
Heel!
He must be smelling our dog.
Even so, he shouldn't be doing that.
Oh, he's young, Millicent.
Remember that next time he drags you under a truck.
Harold.
No!
Okay.
Isn't this an amazing kitchen?
I mean, look at all the cabinet space, the light.
When you have breakfast in here, you're gonna practically have to wear sunglasses.
Am I right?
Maybe.
I don't know.
So let's go to the...
The living room is right through here.
Can I?
Sure, sure.
Oh, my God.
Don't touch the dog.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This is the living room.
Again, you see amazing light.
Oh, yes, it's beautiful.
And here is what I think is the...
Oh, Hello, there.
No, no, Harold.
No, Harold.
I'm so sorry.
He's not fully trained yet, so...
Oh, wow, what a great room.
Isn't it?
Thank you.
Harold, Harold, off.
Leave the paintings alone.
Oh, no, it's all right.
He might buy something.
Would you like to see the bedroom?
Okay.
Yes.
It's just through here.
Oh, that one is lovely.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Oh!
Sorry.
Oh, sorry.
Everybody's a critic.
Well, what do you think?
Oh, I've seen better.
Yeah.
Are you interested in buying?
Me?
God, no.
I just like to look.
I go to all the open houses.
I'm writing a book about them.
A book.
There you go.
Thanks for coming.
People are very interested.
Are you sure about that?
Yeah, yeah.
The search for Abdul Pamir is still underway.
There have been a number of unconfirmed sightings and cell phone photos, but he's still out there somewhere.
More good news from the bridge, though, Brian.
The tanker itself has been moved and all lanes reopened.
Excuse me.
Hmm?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh, please don't do that, sweetheart.
You're gonna break it.
We don't say "no" to Justin.
Well, I can say "no" to him, if you like.
We prefer to explain things to him.
Justin, do you know why it's inappropriate to flick the switch like that?
I don't give a shit.
Adorable.
Thank you.
Replace the French doors with glass.
The crown moldings have to go.
And see if the beams are decorative or actually structural.
Oh, can you tell me if the building association will let me see patients here?
What kind of patients?
I'm a psychotherapist.
You've come to the right place.
And this wall.
What does this wall do?
Hold up the ceiling maybe?
Thanks.
See if we can take down this bedroom wall.
Open it up a bit.
God knows it needs it.
Double pane the windows.
Make sure they get rid of all this crap.
Excuse me.
Oh, yes.
The tub in the bathroom.
What's the deal with the tub?
Oh, well, my husband and I were at Brentfield and we saw this antique...
Thanks.
Make sure that Roberto can take out the fixtures...
This came off.
Oh, well...
Thanks.
I hope you're keeping an eye on things.
I guess.
I wish they would turn the TV off.
Oh, I know.
I told them twice already.
I can't...
Maybe we should make popcorn.
Oh, no.
Not that.
Excuse me.
Did you paint the bathroom that color?
No.
We were out one night and someone broke in and painted the bathroom.
Is there a lot of crime in this neighborhood?
Did you notice that there's a window in the bathroom?
It's really particularly nice.
Come take a look.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I think we should see about how Dorothy's doing.
No, no.
Yes.
The doctor said he would call as soon as he knew anything.
He did.
He...
Oh.
Excuse me.
Oh, yes.
Can I grow plants on the fire escape?
There's a roof.
Really?
Yeah.
And my husband grows plants up there.
Does he?
Yes.
Good for him.
I grow mine for medicinal reasons.
Oh.
Oh, hi.
I hope you don't mind.
I have to lie down in a bedroom before I know what it's like to sleep in it.
I mean, this is the position I'm gonna be in the most in here, isn't it?
I suppose so.
Oh, my God.
This is an awesome apartment.
We like it.
Would you mind just turning off that light?
No.
No.
Thank you.
They make a lot of noise, don't they?
Well, not usually.
How long have you lived here?
40 years.
Wow.
40 years.
That's an awesome view.
Uh...
Yeah.
Yeah, we like it.
You looking to buy?
My mother is.
And which one is she?
She's probably lying down on your bed right now.
Really?
She always does that.
But don't worry.
She won't buy it.
Oh?
We don't have any money.
Oh, I see.
Why are you selling it?
That's a good question.
You have a dog?
Yeah.
She's in the hospital right now.
What's happened?
She's just old.
What's your name?
Zoe.
Zoe?
Mmm-hmm.
Pretty.
What's this?
This, Zoe, is called a turntable.
And it's used to play records.
These records are called LPs.
Stands for long-playing.
The way it works is you take this stylus, there's a little needle in there, and very carefully place it on the record.
I like this song.
So do I.
Who's this?
That's my wife.
I like her glasses.
They were all the rage back then.
How much does the school pay you to model?
Um...
Five dollars.
Well, 10, if it's more than three hours.
So take your time.
I could use the money.
I'm not going anywhere.
Not dressed like this, anyway.
You a vet?
Yeah.
Vietnam?
I don't like to talk politics or religion in the studio.
Oh, my God.
In my family, politics is a religion.
You ready?
Wait.
I wanna do something different with you first.
Should I call the cops?
How long have you had those glasses?
Oh, these?
I don't know.
Since I was a girl.
Here.
Put these on.
No.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, I won't be able to see through them.
Well, I'm the only person in the room who needs to see anything.
Yes, sir.
Take yours off.
Give them to me.
You're the first man I ever met who is more interested in getting my glasses off me than my clothes.
Give them to me.
Take them yourself.
Very cool.
That's the woman I wanna paint.
Why did you pick me?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Out of the modeling pool.
Like, why did you choose me?
'Cause Camille is much prettier than I am.
Everybody picks her, because, God, she's beautiful!
Beauty's not what I'm after.
Oh!
Well, that's a relief.
No, I mean, it's not the most important thing.
So what is?
You're real.
Good answer.
Start painting.
You got three hours.
Thanks so much.
And, again, my number is on the sheet, if you have any questions.
Thank you.
Thanks.
That was worse than I thought it was going to be.
You ought to make it one of the 10 plagues.
First, locusts, then house hunters.
Okay, so the dog ladies are interested.
I'm going for air.
You need anything?
Yeah!
No, we're out of milk.
Milk.
What?
What did you say?
The dog ladies are interested.
Okay.
So are the matching sweaters.
Both have asked for financials on the building.
But, honestly, I don't think we're going to get a real offer, while that madman's on the streets, you know?
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
It's later than I think.
Okay.
I'll be back in an hour.
We did good!
Right?
Did we?
I don't know.
We're with Debbie Hoffman, the 26-year-old bartender who spent several harrowing minutes last evening held hostage by suspected terrorist Abdul Pamir.
What exactly happened, Debbie?
I was about to take stock of the shop, and then this guy comes in.
And I tell him we don't open up for another hour, but he won't leave.
Did you see a bomb?
I don't know.
Could there have been a bomb under his jacket?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Then what happened?
He looks pretty scared.
And he goes up to the register and he takes out all the money.
Nearly 200 bucks.
And I yell at him to put it back.
But he didn't.
No.
He just mumbles something and he runs right out the door.
What was he saying?
You know, who knows?
I don't speak Muslim.
Thank you, Debbie.
She thinks Muslim is a language.
Well, there you have it.
A harrowing experience.
She ought to get a job with the Diplomatic Service.
Stay tuned.
We'll be right back...
It's Lily!
The dog ladies made an offer!
Really?
How much?
850.
850?
Well...
So low?
It's an offer.
That's all.
Yeah.
I don't know.
What do you think?
Should we take this?
What's the rush?
What's the rush?
We've only been in the market 20 minutes.
Yeah, but I don't know.
I mean, if this guy blows himself up, we might not get a better offer.
Aunt Ruth has a point.
If this guy's a terrorist, I say we wait until this blows over or he blows himself up.
And then the prices go back to where they were.
Okay.
Whatever you want.
It's your call.
Oh, wait!
I'm getting another call!
Hello.
Don't you think we should think about it?
No, I don't.
No?
No.
Why not?
Because it's too low.
Okay.
That was the matching sweaters and they're offering to go as high as 875.
875?
But you have to decide now, because they don't want to get into a bidding war.
So the offer is only good for 15 minutes.
But what should we do?
So I'm gonna call the matching sweaters, and tell them about the dog ladies' offer.
And then I'm gonna call the dog ladies and just stall them.
This is getting confusing.
Relax!
This is what I do.
Mr. Hewitt?
I'm going to call the doctor.
He's gonna say that things are exactly as they were when you called an hour ago.
Ruth, you have got to learn to stop worrying.
But I like to worry.
It keeps me calm.
Good news, bad news.
The dog ladies texted, they're thinking of dropping out.
Matching Sweaters said they need more time to discuss it.
What's the good news?
A third party has made a bid.
Who?
The woman with the blue leggings.
Okay, which one was that?
The psychiatrist.
Oh, her.
How much is she offering?
885.
Okay.
Should we take it?
You may have a bidding war on your hands.
And once that starts, reason goes out the window.
I have had couples practically offer me their firstborn.
I am gonna call back Dog Ladies and Matching Sweaters, tell them about our new bid.
Then I'm gonna call Blue Leggings and tell her we are considering her offer.
- Oh, God.
- Hi...
What?
It's like we're talking about Indians in the Old West.
Blue Leggings and Lone Eagle.
Stop it.
Twin Sweaters and Running Trout.
Stop it.
Trout don't run.
Okay!
Hold on.
Did you get my message?
Yeah, but here's the thing.
I don't...
I understand.
I will, uh, ask them.
You should pay attention to her.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay!
We've got a...
Hold on.
Um, hello?
Lily?
Hi.
We'll go up to 886.
Yes.
886.
I will let them know.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
Okay!
Here's where we stand.
Matching Sweaters has offered 886.
See?
You were right.
They're bid surfing.
They're trying to ride the crest of the big numbers.
But the first call I got was from the dog ladies.
What'd they say?
They wanna know what number you need in order to stop the bidding.
Well...
No, no, no.
Tell them to make their best offer, and we'll give it to whichever is highest.
That's the way it works.
Sounds good.
Ah!
Lily Portman and Associates, please hold.
I'm gonna keep you posted.
If you go out, you take your cell phones with you.
Lily Portman.
How can I help?
Yes.
I'm going to miss all of this.
Look at it.
Then why are we moving?
I don't...
Okay.
Wait.
Hello?
Yes, this is Dr. Kramer.
Dorothy's come around.
She's conscious and she's taking water.
Yeah.
That's wonderful.
But we haven't seen any movement in her legs yet.
That doesn't sound good.
Does it?
Look...
When can we come and see her?
Maybe tomorrow?
It might be good for her.
Why don't you come by tomorrow morning?
Well, that would be wonderful.
Thank you very much, Doctor.
Well?
Well.
She's putting up a fight.
Yeah.
What would you expect from our little girl, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She must be frightened though.
Yeah.
She doesn't know where she is.
She doesn't know where she's going.
Like us.
Mmm-hmm.
Like us.
May said they're gonna bring Jackson.
He's back from Hawaii.
Look at that.
God help us.
He's a nice boy.
He's not a boy.
He's a 49-year-old man living with his parents.
Off his parents.
All right, all right.
I know.
He's struggling, okay?
We're all struggling.
Honey, it might be a good time for you to talk to Larry about your paintings.
My clutter, you mean.
No.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I mean, when we move, we're going to have to do something about it.
Nobody wants that stuff.
Huh?
What?
Nobody wants...
No, you don't know that.
I'm going to throw it away, I think.
They're your life's work.
Oh, my God.
You never change, do you?
Larry said that he landed at 7:00.
So as long as the traffic's not too bad, then he will be there to meet you before he has dinner.
And, this guy, I mean.
He's very influential.
His reviews are...
They're all over the place.
Where are you going?
Home.
What?
Get back here!
You're the artist.
Everyone is expecting you there.
No one gives a shit about my work.
I do.
'Cause you have to.
No.
I don't.
Believe me.
We're gonna get there, the place will be empty.
My work is tedious.
It's derivative.
That was one critic.
Oh, my God.
You're such a baby.
I mean, is this what you're gonna be like every time you have a show?
No, because I won't have another show.
No one cares about my work.
Larry cares.
Only because he's my friend.
No.
He is showing up because he thinks he can make money selling it.
So you should stop whining, and just thank God that you have a friend like Larry.
Should thank May.
She's the one who bought him the gallery.
Oh, yeah?
Maybe you should have married a rich girl yourself.
Maybe I should have.
What did I do instead?
I fell in love with some girl from Brooklyn.
Ah, jeez.
You were right.
Empty.
Alex Carver, everybody!
Hi, Larry!
Thank you, Larry.
Hi.
So, anyway, tell us, how's work going?
He's ghost writing a book for someone.
Really?
Yeah.
It's a self-help book.
How do you ghost write a self-help book?
That's what I said!
It pays.
And that's all I care about.
Okay.
Right?
How did Dorothy's surgery go?
Okay.
Well, she's still not moving her legs.
I don't know what to say.
Oh, don't say that!
Oh, for crying out loud.
Mother!
For crying out loud what?
Mother...
You weren't this upset when Daddy was in the hospital.
Well, because she likes the dog more than she likes me.
Some days that's for sure.
Oh, here we go.
Table's ready.
Come, come.
You should leave something.
Oh, I forgot to tell you!
I'll take care of it.
It's on the bill.
We had the open house this morning.
People came?
They came.
They came in droves.
Small droves.
Okay.
Small droves.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
- Should we tell them now?
- Sure.
Why not?
- Yeah.
Might as well.
Tell us what?
Oh.
Uh-oh.
I'm making Jackson my new partnering the gallery.
Really?
Yes.
Fishman and Son.
Partners.
50-50.
That's terrific.
Thank you.
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yeah, it is.
Oh, yes.
Jackson will bring a more youthful take on things.
Anyway, we were talking today about your show.
Well...
You tell him.
We love your stuff, Alex.
Everyone does.
I mean...
You've been successful now, what?
Thirty, 35 years?
Mmm.
But right now your work is a hard sell.
I mean, the market is skewing younger these days.
Portraits are not high on people's shopping lists.
They'll come back.
Sure.
Mmm-hmm.
But right now they are not moving like they used to.
And the bottom line is, you wanna sell your stuff.
Don't you?
I'm sorry, Jackson.
I don't know.
Are we talking about selling art or selling stuff?
Don't shoot the messenger.
No, because artists really don't paint to satisfy "the market."
You see what I mean?
Artists actually paint to satisfy themselves.
And if you're going to run a gallery, you know, it's something you need to know.
Relax, Ruth.
Yeah, I will.
Jackson is running a business.
Don't worry.
Exactly.
Exactly.
See, a gallery is a business.
I get what you're saying.
You're saying that Alex should paint what people want him to paint.
That's right.
That's right.
And then maybe when you have a prospective client lined up, you and Alex can go and you can visit the client's apartment.
And you can see the room where they want to hang the painting.
And you can get some color samples of the wall paint.
Fun.
No, that's not what I meant.
Jackson?
Jackson?
Ruth is pulling your leg.
No, she's not.
No.
I'm not.
I'm not.
You were hard on Jackson.
Well, he better get used to it, if he's going to work with artists.
He's just like Lily.
He just wants us to go away.
Okay.
Well, if they do, then it's up to us to let them know that we're not gonna go anywhere.
I don't wanna move to Florida and play shuffleboard.
Or live on some bullshit golf range, a million miles from everything we know.
Nobody's gonna go live in Florida.
Then where are we gonna go?
We don't wanna wake up and find ourselves out on the street.
Oh, for God's sakes!
Nobody's gonna wake up on the streets.
Alex, why do you always have to be so melodramatic all the time?
I just don't like our lives being in the hands of somebody else.
Well, then fine!
Let's do something about it, all right?
Let's take things into our own hands!
All right.
How do we do that?
Look at us.
We've always done what we wanted to, haven't we?
Yeah.
Right?
We got married when it was still illegal in 30 states.
And people kept staring at us in the other 20.
Right?
So tell me, what's finding an apartment in comparison to that?
So let's just go get ourselves a newspaper and start looking.
And what are you laughing at?
What are you doing?
Why are you laughing at me?
You're reminding me of that girl with the glasses that I painted so long ago.
Yeah?
Yes.
Well, here she is.
And I'll tell you one thing.
You're not gonna get my clothes off so easily this time, mister.
Wanna bet?
- Oh, I've got it.
- Okay.
All right.
I've got it.
Take this.
I got it, I got it.
Oh.
Wait a minute now.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Where is...
No, no.
Look at this.
No.
No.
Where?
Here.
Here.
Here.
Here.
It says this one's...
Franklin Street?
Mmm-hmm.
"Cute"?
What's that mean?
That means it's small.
Oh.
So wait a minute.
What about over here?
Oh, no.
Here's one.
Here's one.
Here's one.
Look at this one in Brooklyn.
It's in Brooklyn.
Uh...
Two bedrooms, lots of space and light.
Old world charm.
That sounds great, doesn't it?
That's our listing, Alex.
Oh.
Well, in that case, we should be able to get it cheap, right?
You think?
Yeah!
Why not?
Don't get smart.
What did Dad say?
Oh, your father.
He's unsettled.
He's unsettled?
Honey, he thinks you're too young.
I'm older than you were when you got married.
And what about you?
What do you think about me marrying Alex?
I don't have an opinion.
Of course you do.
What is it?
I'm satisfied.
You're satisfied that I'm getting married?
What do you want?
I want you to be satisfied with that sundae that you're eating.
You know, I want you to be satisfied with the soda that you're drinking.
But you're my mother.
So I want you to be overjoyed that I'm marrying Alex.
You know, at least, I want you to be happy for me.
I'm trying.
Try harder.
Mom is only trying to say that this marriage is gonna be difficult, Ruth.
And what marriage isn't?
There's still so much prejudice, and...
Oh, really, Sarah?
Thank you for telling me.
Think of your children.
Think of your children.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sweetheart.
You can tell Dad that he doesn't want to make me choose between my family and Alex.
Because if he does, you can tell him that my choice is already made.
"And foolish though it may seem to me."
This one sounds really nice.
Listen.
"Dazzling sun-filled corner two-bedroom, built-in bookcases,
"window seats, soaks up the morning sunshine."
That's nice.
Yeah.
Where is it?
It's on 73rd and First.
Do we want to live in Manhattan?
Well, I mean, I think it would be a good change for us.
And we'd be close to Larry and May's place, too.
And how much is it?
It's...
Well, it's a lot.
It's one million, one hundred thousand dollars.
Okay, but...
We can't afford that.
Yes, but there's no harm in looking, honey.
No harm in looking.
Oh...
Look at her.
She recognizes us, honey.
Look at this girl.
Hello.
She hasn't walked yet.
But she's obviously happy to see you.
Of course she is!
Of course she is!
Hey.
Hey.
Look at her.
She's bandaged up.
Can I touch her, Doctor?
Yeah, of course.
Oh, yes.
You're so good.
You hang in there, kiddo.
You hang in there, you hear me?
You're such a good girl.
Hang in there.
Good girl.
That a girl.
I know she's gonna walk.
I know it.
Of course she is.
She's a fighter like you.
Like us.
So what's a junior bedroom?
What do you mean?
Does it have bunk beds?
Well, if it does, you get the top one.
Okay, honey?
This is it.
This is it.
You're kidding.
Yeah.
No, this is it.
It sure sounded better in the paper, didn't it?
We're wasting our time.
No, come on.
We're here.
Well, let's just look.
Okay?
Wait a second.
Which...
It buzzed.
Oh, it did.
Okay.
Got it.
4C. 4C.
Oh, 4C?
Are you sure?
That's what the sign said.
Okay.
That's the...
Come on.
Okay.
All right.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Wow.
Don't even bother.
Let me check this...
It's you again.
Hmm.
I'm afraid so.
It's not as nice as your place.
It's not, is it?
Where's your mom?
Where do you think?
Lying down on the bed.
How's your dog doing?
Well, she survived the operation, but still hasn't moved her hind legs.
She will.
You think so?
Yeah.
I know things like that.
I see.
I'm gonna go get my mom.
... this time in a taxi.
We're going now to Logan Crawford, who is reporting from underneath the FDR with the abandoned taxi.
What's going on?
Pamir.
He hijacked a taxi.
When?
This morning.
Really?
... reporting underneath the FDR Drive.
The driver reported that Mr. Pamir seemed very nervous and he kept on asking, "What are the police doing?"
He also asked about his family and seemed to be saying a prayer.
I don't know.
I think that we should take the 885 that Blue Leggings is offering.
No, we don't want to rush into anything.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's them!
Did you see, honey?
Yeah.
They're not interested in our place anymore.
Now, you don't know that.
Yeah, well they're here, aren't they?
They're just hedging their bets.
Wouldn't you?
This whole thing.
Oh, please.
It's just making me so nervous.
So do you wanna see this place?
Not if it's as bad as the last one.
Well, don't be discouraged.
We're just looking.
Yes.
I didn't know how bad it could be.
It's in the neighborhood.
Remember?
You remember it.
It's the sunny two-bedroom.
Yes.
It's probably in a basement.
It's in the basement.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think this is it.
Oh!
This looks nice.
And it's on the ninth floor!
We've never lived that high up before.
What's his...
I know what it is.
It said Vincent, right?
Here we go.
Yeah.
I think that's it.
There we go.
There we go.
Oh!
Oh, sorry.
Here's a flyer for you, if you want to take that with you.
Sure.
Oh!
Oh, this is so much nicer.
Really.
Didn't I tell you?
Yup.
I mean, look at this entranceway.
I love this kind of an entranceway, honey.
And what about the light?
Yeah.
Very good.
It's not even that bright out today.
Honey, I'm gonna go find some water and take my pill.
All right, all right, all right.
Hey.
Piece of shit.
Here.
Oh, hey, you.
Why do they make it so hard to open?
Childproof.
Of course.
Do you like this place?
It's the best we've seen so far.
Put that back for me.
But it's still not as nice as yours.
Nothing is.
I hope you find a place you like.
So do I.
And when we do, I'm going to invite you to tea.
How is that?
Cool.
Oh!
Sorry.
Okay, I like this place.
I really do.
I really like it a lot.
Come here.
I want to show you something.
Just see this room.
Look at this, honey.
Look.
Oh!
Yes.
I'm gonna talk to the agent.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm doing it.
Yeah.
Nowhere is going to have a view like our place.
But maybe Ruth and I have seen all the views we need to.
Maybe views are for younger people who still have things to look at.
Okay.
We'll look to hear from you guys this afternoon.
Thank you.
Here she is.
Here she is.
Oh, hi.
Excuse me.
Actually, my husband and I are very interested.
Well, I don't have to tell you, this listing is getting a lot of heat.
Oh, yes.
We can see that.
Let me be frank with you.
Can you afford a place like this?
What do you mean?
I only ask, because no one's gonna give you a 30-year mortgage.
We don't need a mortgage.
Oh!
Well, then make an offer.
The owners are willing to consider anything.
But they're only accepting bids until 3:00.
That's two hours.
Mmm-hmm.
Have your offer here by then.
They'll make their decision right away.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Ma'am?
Yes?
A lot of people include a personal message with their offer.
What kind of personal message?
Something that persuades the seller to give it to you, in case there's a tie.
Just don't be afraid to pull on the heartstrings.
Oh.
Right.
How do you like that one talking to us like we don't know anything?
I bet we've got more real money than all those young hotshots anyway.
But I just want to know.
What did you think of it?
I liked it.
Really?
Yeah.
Let's bid on it.
How?
We haven't sold our own place yet.
No, but we will.
We will.
We had a bunch of offers.
And you heard the real estate broker say that they are very willing to consider anything until 3:00.
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.
Any offer that's, like, until 3:00.
It's a beautiful apartment.
Yeah, it's all right.
It has a lot of light.
Yes.
It has light.
It has an elevator.
And more room.
New paint.
Honey, come on.
Let's do it.
Come on.
It sounds like something you really want.
In that case, we'll see another doctor.
What for?
He'll say the same thing the others did.
Maybe not.
Alex, you know he will.
It's the most natural thing in the world and I can't even do it.
My mother, my sisters, they churn them out like machines, one after another.
We don't need children.
No one needs children, Alex.
People want them.
I want them.
You want them.
Shit!
Shit!
I am a goddamned failure.
You are not a failure.
I've disappointed you.
You've never disappointed me, Ruth.
I can see it in your face.
Stop saying that.
You have classrooms full of children, those are your kids.
That's not the same thing.
Then me.
I'm your kid.
You're always telling me what a big baby I am.
Well, you are.
You really like it, don't you?
I do.
And, honey, admit it.
You do, too.
I mean, I know...
I know...
Wait a second.
I know it's not our place, but we're never gonna find another place like our place.
And we won't find anything better than this.
So, Alex, I mean, it's just...
What is it?
It's a bid.
It's not a commitment.
It's like...
You know, we're not going to find...
They're never going to take it.
Trust me, they're never going to take it.
All right, fine.
Let's do it.
Really?
Yeah.
Should we call Lily?
No.
I mean, you said you thought we should do this ourselves.
So I think we should, but be smart.
What do you think we should offer?
Well...
I mean...
Not so low that we have no chance.
I know.
But not so high that we're stuck with something that we can't afford.
So what would be the point of that, right?
Right, yeah.
I don't know.
Look, this is what I think.
I think $900,000.
That's too low. $910,000.
You think?
I don't know.
Well, uh...
You think?
$910,000?
$920,000.
No, $920,000.
No, but that's too much.
That's way too much.
Honey, do you want the place or not?
Yes.
I definitely want the place.
I want to be in the running.
Yes.
So $920,000.
$920,000.
No. $925,000.
It's more impressive.
Whoa!
Listen to you!
What?
You sound like you're some sort of an auctioneer!
Twenty-five?
Okay, do I hear $930,000?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, $930,000.
$930,000?
That's a lot better.
I mean, so what the heck?
It's just money.
This is hard to write, when I don't know exactly what these people are like.
Tell them I'm senile and I want to live by the zoo.
Be serious, please.
How about donating a park bench with their name on it?
Okay.
Just tell them we love the place.
Breaking news.
The bartender, Debbie Hoffman, who claimed that Pamir robbed her cash register has now been charged with theft and misleading police after she admitted that she took the money.
Yeah.
I knew there was something wrong with that.
Alex?
Oh, my God.
Alex?
What?
We got the apartment!
What?
Already?
Yeah.
Isn't that wonderful?
Now, they want us to come over with the check right now.
Right now?
That's what they said.
I don't know.
You don't know what?
I mean, I think we should wait.
For what?
Well, we don't wanna be giving our money to somebody with all this going on.
You know what?
We're gonna lose this apartment.
That's what we're gonna do.
We're not gonna lose it.
Well, what am I going to say to the real estate broker?
Just tell them we...
We...
We...
What?
Tell them we can't get there right now.
They're gonna take the next best offer, Alex.
No, they won't.
Yes, they are.
No, they won't.
Uh...
Wait.
Don't pick it up.
Don't!
Don't pick it up.
Why?
The sellers are getting anxious.
If we don't hear from you soon, they're going to open up the bidding again.
You heard what she said.
They're gonna reopen the bidding.
She's bluffing.
She's not bluffing.
Right now we're the only ones that are bluffing.
Come on, honey.
We've gone this far.
We can't back down now.
The last thing we need, Ruth, is for somebody else to be pushing us into something.
Nobody is pushing us into anything.
Take things into our own hands.
That's what you said, honey.
I know what I said.
Will you please look at me?
All day yesterday I heard you complain about being treated like garbage and ending up on the streets.
And then finally last night, we decide to make a move, but only if we have total control.
So we look at a few places.
And then finally...
Finally we get excited about one, we make an offer and lo and behold we get it.
We actually get the place.
And now you wanna back down?
Listen, if you wanna take control, this is how we take control, honey!
All I'm saying, Ruth, is this is a lot of money!
I know!
But if we walk away from this we'll just be acting like a couple of old fools!
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hey?
Oh, my God!
Oh.
Everybody is still crazy out there.
I wish they would go ahead and find this guy already.
Jesus.
All right.
Here's where we are.
Blue Leggings is our last solid bid at 885.
But the dog ladies have called and they wanna come by in a few minutes with a counter bid.
Apparently, they wanna do it in person, because they wanna make some kind of...
What's the matter?
Oh!
Aunt Ruth, what happened?
We saw a place this morning.
What do you mean you saw a place?
We went to an open house this morning and we loved it.
You went to an open house today?
If you knew you were ready to look...
I don't understand.
Why didn't you call me first?
What?
Wait.
We don't need to be asking you for permission.
No, I realize that, but I have listings, too.
I have stacks of listings and I have done a lot of work for you.
This isn't the easiest market.
Why didn't you call me first, Aunt Ruth?
I'm sorry, Lily.
I really am sorry.
I don't know what I was...
It wasn't her idea.
It was mine.
You know, an apartment might not be the best idea for you right now.
There are other...
Bullshit!
Wait a minute now!
We'll decide where we're going to live.
Okay.
Okay.
Have it your way.
Where is it?
This place that you like so much?
It's in Manhattan.
Yeah, it's on 73rd and First.
It's just so beautiful.
And how much is it?
A million, one.
A million, one!
Mmm-hmm.
I don't know.
We made an offer.
I don't believe this.
Well, they accepted it.
Well, what did you offer?
$930,000.
And they took it?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's not bad.
Oh.
So we're not such fools after all, huh?
Okay.
Okay.
Uh...
Let's get real here for a minute.
So nobody buys an apartment nowadays before they sell their own.
Especially not with what's going on out there.
Who's the agent?
I have the card.
Wait, I know where it is.
I know I have it.
I know where it is.
Wait.
A woman, or...
No, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Yeah.
Oh.
Okay.
Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam...
Carswell?
She's a shark!
What?
She's gonna eat you for breakfast!
What did she say?
They want the deposit.
Well, of course they do.
When?
Right now.
What did you tell them?
Well, we haven't called her back yet.
No, but wait a minute.
We want this apartment.
Well, then it is crucial that you sell this place fast!
Okay.
Okay, give me a minute to think this through.
Um...
I'm gonna...
Yeah!
I'm gonna call Miriam.
Okay.
Let me handle her.
Oh, God, she is upset.
Hey, Miriam...
I don't know why she couldn't talk to them in front of us.
I hope we haven't stepped on her toes.
I don't want them making deals behind our backs.
I really didn't know the protocol.
We just saw an apartment we liked and...
Well, she'll live.
Okay, here's where we stand.
I convinced Miriam that you're serious, but that you have to rest.
I reminded her how old you are.
I reassured her that we would all be there by 5:00 with the deposit.
Okay.
What time is it, though?
What time do we...
It's 3:30.
And the dog ladies will be here any second, so...
Wait, wait, Lily.
Now, aren't we moving a little quickly here?
May I remind you that you're the ones who want to buy a new apartment.
This is how it works.
Dog eat dog.
You snooze, you lose.
Okay.
And one more thing,
I told Miriam that I'm the one who steered you to her listing.
So if she asks, back me up.
The least you can do is help me get a piece of the commission on it, right?
Well, sure.
I mean, obviously.
That's only fair, Lily.
Okay.
So let me know as soon as you hear the dog ladies' offer.
And keep your fingers crossed that it's at least $950,000, because that's what we need to make this work.
9-5-0.
Otherwise we're screwed.
Man!
She really does talk too much.
Authorities may be one step closer to catching the terror suspect Abdul Pamir.
Police have released security camera footage that appears to show Pamir looking over his shoulder and showing obvious concern.
Oh, God.
Doorbell.
I know.
I know.
Move it.
Move it, handsome.
Why, hello.
Hi.
I hope you don't mind us just stopping by like this.
We were training Harold in the park.
We're here to make an offer.
Oh, well, please come in.
Would you like something to drink?
Anything?
Oh, no.
We don't want to intrude.
Just give them the bid, Annie.
Yes.
So this is as high as we can go.
How is your dog doing?
Mmm...
Well, it's actually kind of touch-and-go, so...
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Harold's actually not doing so well, either.
In school.
He has a learning disability.
We think.
Oh.
Give her the...
Well, they...
Here you go.
So this is our letter.
In case there's a tie.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh, Harold.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Harold, you concentrate, now.
Do you hear me?
Don't open that letter till you've read their offer.
What?
I said don't open that letter till you read their offer.
No, I won't.
Will you please open it?
Oh.
Hello.
Hi, Lily.
Yep.
The offer is $950,000.
All right.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
That's good.
$950,000.
Mmm-hmm.
Fine.
That's good.
All right.
Bye.
That is absolutely wonderful.
We can make this work.
Is Lily gonna call them and give them the good news?
She's gonna call the others first and see if they wanna make a counter offer.
Yeah?
What?
No.
Tell them they can keep their lousy $1,000.
Hang on.
Hang on.
What?
Lily?
Lily, what happened?
The matching sweaters offered $951,000.
But here's the good news.
Dr. Gilbert's gonna e-mail you a counter offer.
Wait.
Okay.
But who is Dr. Gilbert?
Blue Leggings.
Oh, no.
Let me know what it is as soon as you get it.
We have to get over to the other place in half an hour.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay.
Bye.
Will you check the e-mail?
Yeah.
I know how to use the Internet.
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Carver..."
My partner and I moved to New York only a few years ago.
And as you probably know better than most, it's not always been easy for us.
We've been trying to adopt for nearly six years and it looks like we'll finally have a baby daughter.
A little girl from India.
Your husband's studio would make such a wonderful room for her.
Full of light and love.
Please consider letting us live in your wonderful home.
Shoot.
Honey, what?
Ruth, do this.
Um...
No, let me get it.
Let me get it for you.
Let me get it.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You do it.
You do it.
It's all right.
Got it.
Got it, got it.
Okay, well.
Blue Leggings made an offer.
What is it?
$960,000.
Nine...
That's good!
Uh...
I don't know.
Yeah.
What?
You're disappointed?
No.
It's just...
Honey, I read the dog ladies' letter.
And I just think we should give them a chance to counter offer.
Just...
Ruth, you heard that lady say this was their final offer.
See, I told you not to read that letter.
I know.
But they're adopting a little girl.
These people are offering $10,000 more!
But do we really want someone like that living here?
Honey?
Do we?
I'm just asking.
Ruth?
We're talking 10 grand.
All day we've been throwing numbers back and forth, like they don't mean anything.
850, 900, 950.
Sugar, we're not rich.
We need to get a grip on reality here.
I know.
You're right.
It's just...
I wish we could give it to them.
I wish a lot of things.
I wish we could give our apartment to whoever needed it.
I wish we could give it to that lady on the bed and her little girl.
Most of all, I wish I could run up and down the damn stairs, like I used to, for the rest of my life.
Ugh.
Okay.
It's right there.
I got it.
I got it.
Here it is.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, Doctor.
What?
Really?
What?
What?
Really?
She walked.
She walked?
She walked?
Yes.
Dorothy walked!
I knew she would.
High-five.
Yes.
Let me tell you.
What?
Once I give them this check...
Yeah.
... there's no turning back.
I know.
Everything is different.
Good different, honey.
Good different.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Now, wait.
Okay, here it is.
Who is it?
Oh, my husband and I are here with the deposit.
Hello?
Hello, there!
You sure you got the right apartment?
I'm sure.
Yeah.
Hello?
We've come to buy the apartment!
Yes, we're...
Your broker!
We're meeting with your broker!
She told us to meet her here!
I know who you are.
Your agent isn't here yet.
You can wait for her outside.
Oh, that's nice.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am going to call Lily.
'Cause that's rude.
No, no, no.
Here comes somebody.
Oh, good.
That's just...
I'm calling Lily.
Lily!
Oh!
It's show time.
Okay.
I don't want to take it.
I want to wait.
We have to take it.
We can't wait.
Who the hell is that?
That's their agent.
I said not later than 5:00.
I'm coming!
For Christ's sake.
Great.
They've been holding us hostage all afternoon, now they can't wait to get in.
Hi!
Hi.
How did you get in?
Uh...
Gentleman with the dog.
So much for security.
Come on in.
Oh.
Thank you.
This is Mrs. Carver.
Hi.
This is Mr. Carver.
I'm Lily Portman.
Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
I'm Lily Portman.
How are you?
I need to talk to my wife.
This is Mrs. Carver...
Sure.
Let's just go inside then.
Okay.
Thank you.
Great.
I don't want to take the offer.
I don't want to take it.
We don't have to take it.
I know.
Fine.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's get down to business.
Hey, Miriam.
Hello.
So we have the deposit check.
Great.
What if we refuse it?
Why would you refuse it?
Hold on.
'Cause maybe we want to open the bidding back up.
Why would you want to do that?
So we can get better offers.
These two have been holding us hostage all afternoon.
Nobody's been holding you hostage.
Okay.
All right.
Relax, everybody.
They're here now.
And this is the best offer you've gotten.
Especially while all that shit drags on out there.
If you refuse my client's check, it will be up to the courts to decide.
Your kid could be out of college by the time this thing is resolved.
Is that what you want?
Take his damn check.
Okay.
This way.
Do they even know what they're doing?
We know what we're doing.
Who do I make it out to?
Stephen Vincent.
Is that a "P-H" or a "V"?
P-H!
Something's happening.
Oh!
It's the terrorist thing!
What's happening?
It looks like they found him or something.
Logan, what do you see?
Oh, my God!
And the suspect in this terrorism plot, Abdul Pamir...
In fact, there he is right now.
I can see him.
He's coming out.
That's him.
He has his hands over his head.
Yeah.
Wow.
- Uh-oh.
- He appears to be surrendering.
Now police is sending in a canine unit to sniff the suspect, to see if there is actually a bomb or device.
There is a dog checking the suspect now.
Wait a second.
He seems very calm.
That might be a bomb there, though.
The dog has walked off now.
That means there is likely no device, no bomb.
Get him off the streets for good.
- Very, very good news indeed.
- That's his white flag.
Wow.
- It's good they got him.
- Lock him up.
You can hear the choppers up ahead as well.
New York City's Finest is doing their job and they have got their man.
And they are about to put the bracelets on him.
Shoot the son of a bitch.
Right in the balls.
Come on.
Look at him.
Heck, he's just a kid!
Well, what did you expect?
I don't know.
A monster.
Anything but this.
What did he really do?
That little prick cost me 50 grand.
That's what he did.
You need to let it go.
We can all rest easier now, knowing this terrorist is off our streets.
Isn't it a little bit too early to actually convict this young man?
The poor guy.
Poor guy, my ass!
I knew we should have waited.
You are the one that said to take the first decent offer that we got.
I remind you.
You are obligated to take my client's offer.
- Yes?
- Yes.
Just...
All right.
Just sign
- the thing already.
- We're gonna sign.
Just sign where indicated, Mr. Carver.
I'm not signing.
Alex, are you all right?
What do you mean you're not signing it?
I mean I'm not signing the damn thing.
What's he talking about?
Jesus Christ.
Give me a break.
We don't want your apartment.
Alex, what are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing, Lily?
I'm putting an end to this bullshit.
All day long we've been pulled back and forth, back and forth.
Only to come up here and hear these two accuse us of I don't know what!
Nobody is accusing you of anything.
I understand that's what...
No...
Whoa, whoa.
Wait.
Please.
Let him finish, okay?
We don't want your apartment.
Put it back on the market.
I hope they get a billion dollars for it!
You know, when one door closes, another door opens.
Okay.
Thank you, Lily.
Thanks.
Alex?
Alex?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I gotta get out of here.
No...
Wait a second.
Wait.
You can't just storm off like that.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Ruth.
But seeing that young man, kneeling on the ground like that.
It just made me realize that we're just like everybody else today.
Getting all worked up over nothing.
Yeah.
Why are we moving?
What are we chasing?
Haven't we built a good life?
I only meant to help.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I know that.
I know.
I know, Ruth.
You know, you're probably gonna live to be 100.
Mmm-hmm.
I hope so.
I don't want to live without you.
And I really don't care.
You know that, right?
I don't care if we stay in Brooklyn or we move to Moscow.
I just want what's best for you.
And us.
Let's go home.
God, I love you, you silly old man.
I don't know what just went down in there, but it could work for us.
You lost this place.
It doesn't matter.
I've got plenty of others.
The good news is that you didn't accept any of the offers on your apartment.
And what he said is true, things are gonna go up, now that that idiot's off the streets.
And we could hold out for a million dollars.
Maybe more.
No, Lily...
No?
No, what?
Too much?
No.
It's too little!
We're not holding out, Lily.
We're not selling.
What do you mean?
I've got solid offers.
I can get you better ones.
You can't back out now.
Lily, we can do whatever the hell we want.
But...
Selling is the right thing for you.
It's the right thing for you.
You're just acting this way, because you're scared.
We're not scared.
We're doing it, because it's the right thing to do.
And he's right, Lily.
We don't need to sell right now.
Will you just...
Will you just stop for a minute?
What?
Listen, you cannot live in that apartment forever.
We can't live anywhere forever.
No, but we can manage there for a while.
This is ridiculous.
What about all the work I put in, Ruth?
There's just really nothing more to say.
I'm sorry.
Well, then I'm gonna say it.
You're a crazy old man, who doesn't know what's good for you.
Hey, no, you do not speak to him like that!
And you're no better!
Fuck you both!
I guess we won't be going to her place for Thanksgiving this year.
You hate her stuffing, anyway.
It took a while for Dorothy to get back on her feet.
But, by the time winter set in, she and I had returned to our usual routine.
Hi.
I thought that was you two.
Hey.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing, honey?
Look at you.
Did you manage to get any paint on the walls?
Funny.
What?
Didn't that bad man feed you?
Yes.
She ate.
She doesn't think so.
Well, she is either confused or lying.
Here.
How's it going in there?
Oh, thanks.
Well...
Uh, it's going.
Good.
Mmm-hmm.
Can I see?
Mmm-hmm.
See, nobody told me that painting would be this hard.
Oh, jeez.
I'm sorry about that.
Not sorry enough.
What do you think?
Huh?
It's good, huh?
Yeah.
It looks very good.
I like it better than this gray that you chose.
Thanks.
Why are you still painting this old lady?
What old lady?
Ooh.
Good answer.
Look at that.
Those few days were like one big roller coaster ride.
And, like most rides, we ended up where we began.
Still, it reminded us who we are.
What we have.
It was worth it, if only for that.
Maybe one day we'll sell.
Stop climbing the stairs.
But for now we'll just deal with what is.
The important thing is it brought us back here.
Together.
Back to our senses.
And to our home.

ALEX:
When Ruth and I first moved to Brooklyn, it was like an outpost.
To our friends in Manhattan, we might as well have moved to Nebraska.
It was out of fashion, but a good place for a struggling artist like me.
And we liked it, which was good, because it was all we could afford.
Morning, Mr. Rahim.
Good morning, Mr. Carver.
Good morning, Dorothy.
So tomorrow's the big day.
You ready to move?
I don't know.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
I would get out of here in a minute if I could.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Ah.
Where would you go?
Where would I go?
New York is the best city in the world.
(LAUGHING)
Hello.
Hello.
Ruth.
It's like talking to someone in the wreck of the Titanic.
Ruth!
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
Ruth.
Ruth.
Uh...
What am I looking for in here?
The Times.
(STATIC ON PHONE)
Oh.
Um...
I'm losing you.
Alex, stop moving around.
Are you near the door?
Listen to me.
Yeah.
It's in the rack.
Oh!
Mmm-hmm.
Lily's coming, so I got to go.
Yeah, she's here.
So I'll talk to you later.
You'll be fine.
(PANTING) Honestly.
Aunt Ruth, I don't know how you and Alex do it.
I'm 40-whatever.
And look at me.
Jesus, I got to join a gym.
Uh...
Excuse me.
Where is The Times?
Aunt Ruth.
Hide this.
We're gonna see a lot of action tomorrow.
Your mother gave that to me.
Well...
I wish she hadn't smoked so much.
I guess people don't really give ashtrays as gifts anymore, do they?
I don't know if people even make them anymore.
So the shades all have to be up.
Light is money.
Remember that.
How many people will come, do you think?
Who knows?
But what we want are the serious ones.
Oh.
You always get the lookers.
The people who just come to see how other people live.
It makes them feel better about their lives.
Or worse.
Who knows?
So when you're trying to sell, you don't want any clutter.
Uh-huh.
Less is more.
All the books gotta go away.
Chekhov.
The Lady with the Dog.
This was my favorite story to teach.
Uh-huh.
The girls loved it, but I remember the boys not so much.
Did you get Uncle Alex to change his mind?
Oh, he's still on the fence about it, but you know artists.
Too much practicality overwhelms them.
Ah, I'll get him there.
Because you're looking at maybe a million dollars.
Give or take.
Oh.
Two years ago, it would have been even more.
It was a feeding frenzy then.
ALEX:
The neighborhood's changed a lot.
It's cool now, filled with hipsters.
And gentrifiers.
Mothers with baby strollers that cost as much as a Chevy.
And their banker husbands, their heads buried in their smart phones.
Crossing the street while you're trading stocks and bonds doesn't seem that smart to me.
(CAR HORN HONKING)
(BRAKES SCREECHING) DRIVER:
Hey!
Hey!
Watch where you're going.
The neighborhood's just got itself a Whole Foods.
All it needs now is the ultimate sign of modern civilization.
An Apple Store.
But as much as it's changing, I'm gonna miss this place.
(DOROTHY WHINES)
Come on, Dorothy.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Come on, now.
Come on.
That's a good girl.
(SIGHS)
Good morning, Mr. Carver.
Oh, hi, Erica.
Are you all ready for the open house?
I guess so.
It's not the same market it was a few years ago, you know?
Well, we're just testing the waters.
What you're gonna want to do tomorrow, first thing, when you wake up...
Mmm-hmm.
...turn this on and let it simmer.
It gives the whole apartment a homey feel.
Okay.
It works every time.
Let's hope a lot of people are gonna love this apartment tomorrow.
This is a young people's building.
You know?
The stairs.
(PANTING)
(WHINING CONTINUES) Come on.
I know you're tired.
So am I. Come on.
(EXHALES) (WHINING CONTINUES)
I know.
Come on.
YOUNG RUTH:
Here, let me try.
YOUNG ALEX:
I know how to put a key in the door.
Give it here.
I got it.
(SQUEALS)
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm carrying my bride across the threshold.
What bride?
We've been married two years.
You still like it?
Like it?
I love it.
Oh, look at all this light.
Hi.
I'm Alex Carver.
My wife and I, we just moved in.
(WOMEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)
Oh, hey, Alex.
Hey.
Hey, Dorothy.
Did you have a good walk, sweetie?
Big day tomorrow.
You all set?
Yes.
What is that smell?
Oh, that's cinnamon.
It gives the place a homey feel.
It smells like a whorehouse.
Is that a fact?
Yes.
And what does a whorehouse smell like, sir?
Well, it smells like this.
Uh-huh.
So, uh, I'm gonna be bringing the first couple, the Schuylers, by at 9:00 a.m.
9:00 a.m. Why not 6:00?
Oh, come on, Alex, please, you promised.
So we could be getting a lot of people here tomorrow, and if you could tidy up your studio, it would be great.
Because it's such a wonderful room, but it looks smaller than it is with all the clutter.
Anyway.
That's great.
So it's gonna be great.
Good.
Thanks, Lily.
I can hardly wait.
(SAYING GOODBYE IN FRENCH)
Bye, Lily.
You could be nice to her.
She's done a lot of work for us, honey.
She talks too much.
Well, I can't disagree with that.
ALEX:
This room has been my studio for more than 40 years.
What room will I be painting in next year?
Will it have a view?
Will it even have a window?
I think these could go over here, honey.
All right, here, here.
Here, I'll take it.
I'll take it.
All right.
(GROANS)
Are you okay?
Okay.
I got it.
Ruth.
What?
We're making a mistake.
What do you want me to do, Alex?
I mean, it's already in the paper.
I just don't want Lily to railroad us like she did her mother.
That's because Sarah was sick, please.
Where would we go?
Oh, I think...
Well, with a million dollars, frankly, we could go anywhere.
We might get a million dollars.
Anyway, it'll cost a million dollars to get another place like this.
Not to mention the cost of moving and selling.
Well, then we'll go where the houses are cheaper.
There's no way we can leave New York.
We're not going to leave New York.
No.
All we need is a place for you to paint and an elevator.
I handle the stairs better than Lily does.
Sure, you do now, honey, but...
What about later?
I don't know.
You know, I...
I've read about these open houses.
Uh-huh.
People steal things.
(LAUGHS) Okay, I will nail the furniture to the floor.
All right?
I don't like the idea of all those people in here poking through our things.
You don't have to be here.
You do not have to be here.
You can take a walk.
You can go see a movie.
Well, I might do that.
We're just dipping our toes into the water.
That's all.
Nobody's making any commitments.
Nobody.
(DOROTHY WHIMPERING)
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What happened?
What's wrong?
(WHINING LOUDLY)
Alex.
Something's wrong with Dorothy.
What?
What's the matter?
She's shaking.
I don't know.
She's shaking, and then when I picked her up she screamed.
What's the matter, girl?
She screamed.
I don't know, I think she's in pain.
Maybe we should take her to the vet.
It's probably nothing.
No.
Remember last year?
It cost us $700 to find out she had gas.
Don't try to go so fast, Ruth.
You don't want to fall down these steps.
I'm not gonna fall down.
She's shaking, because she's upset.
I think we could use an elevator.
Don't you?
At this point?
Well, I guess we could, but we don't have one.
What happened?
We think it's her back.
You want a cab?
Yeah.
Please, please.
Taxi!
Oh, thank God.
Is there a fire?
They say that there's a gasoline truck stuck on the Williamsburg Bridge.
Always something, isn't it?
Thank you, Mr. Rahim.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Good luck with the dog.
(HORNS HONKING)
(DOROTHY WHINING)
The tanker is blocking two lanes.
That's right, Brian.
(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
All Manhattan-bound traffic is stuck right now...
Are they talking about the bridge?
Could you turn the music down, please?
Yeah.
Please.
Thank you.
...has jackknifed on the Williamsburg Bridge a few minutes ago.
The mayor made a statement urging people to avoid all but essential...
I still don't hear anything.
What?
Did you forget your hearing aid?
Some tanker's stuck on the bridge.
That's all I'm hearing.
Now, the mayor's telling people not to come into the city tonight.
Should we have taken the tunnel?
Nah.
No way.
Everything's a mess.
(WHIMPERS) Hey...
What's with your dog?
You know, actually, we don't know.
Maybe he ate a plastic bag.
You know, my dog did that once.
He got real sick.
Oh, I'm sorry.
RUTH:
Okay, thank you.
There you go.
Keep the change.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
Here we go.
Hey, good luck with the dog.
You'll find out in the morning if she ate a bag.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
You've got it?
Yeah.
Do you want me to carry her?
No, no, I've got her.
It's okay, sweetie.
We're almost there.
Okay, sweetie.
Oh, my God.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I found her on the kitchen floor in her own urine.
And then when I picked her up she screamed.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, Dorothy.
Let's see what's going on here.
It's highly probable it's a ruptured disk, but we'll need to do a CAT scan to know for sure.
Yeah.
CAT scan?
Is that expensive?
Alex.
Alex.
I'm just asking, Ruth.
It's not cheap, Mr. Carver.
How much?
Around $1,000.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah...
Okay.
DR. KRAMER:
We should do this right away.
RUTH:
Yeah.
All right.
Good.
Okay, Dorothy.
Okay.
Okay, Dorothy.
(WHIMPERING)
RUTH:
Do you really think they can fix a ruptured disk?
Who knows?
We just have to be ready for the worst.
Don't say that, please, Alex.
She's 10 years old, Ruth.
I know.
But 10 is not that old.
You're older than her in dog years.
Oh, thanks.
DR. KRAMER:
The rupture is between T-13 and L-1.
It's about two-thirds down her spine.
RUTH:
Okay.
Usually, this type of injury is best with surgery.
What if you can't fix it?
Well, animals adapt very well to new challenges, Mrs. Carver.
I've seen dogs with paralysis live a full life with the use of wheels.
Wheels?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, look, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We'll keep her on the steroids.
And in the meantime, you should go home.
And we'll call you in the morning.
Okay?
Okay.
I just wish we didn't have to leave her here overnight, you know?
Try not to put yourself in her place.
Animals adapt to their fates more easily than we do.
They don't remember what was.
Right?
I...
Okay.
They deal with things as they are now.
Should we tell him how far we're willing to go?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
I mean, we have to be realistic, Ruth.
We can only spend so much.
And you heard what the doctor said.
Animals live in the now.
And it might not even be fair to Dorothy.
You might want to consider this.
Wait.
What?
I'll call you tomorrow.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry, but what is that?
This is a DNR.
Do Not Resuscitate.
What are you talking...
Wait a minute.
Oh!
Ruth.
No.
Why did you sign that form?
We have to be practical, Ruth.
But, Alex, it's not your decision to make.
We have to do everything we can for her.
And we will.
But what if there isn't anything we can do?
There's always something to do, Alex.
I just think it might be the kindest thing for her.
Yeah.
Why do you always assume...
Just let me ask you this.
Why do you always assume everything is gonna go wrong?
Because I plan for the worst and I hope for the best.
Oh, you think I don't know that after 40 years of marriage?
Insane.
We've had this same damn discussion for a thousand times.
It's not a discussion.
Don't tell me that.
It's not a discussion.
This is an argument, Alex.
All right.
Argument, discussion, whatever you want to call it.
I'm just doing what I think is right.
Okay, fine.
All right.
Fine, you do that.
But I'll tell you right now, it doesn't really matter, because I'm sure that Dorothy's gonna be fine.
FEMALE REPORTER ON TV:
There has been no movement at this point.
The driver appears to be missing.
The NYPD, well, they're not saying very much, but...
NYPD has released the identity of the suspect as Abdul Pamir.
We know who he is, but the real questions are, where is he?
What is he up to?
And why did he run away?
Did you take your pill?
Yes, love.
Mmm-hmm.
MALE REPORTER:
Thanks, Julie.
I've already spoken with some of the people who were on the bridge when the tanker jackknifed.
And they said their immediate concern was...
ALEX:
I'm going up to the roof.
Okay.
WOMAN:
Do you see what I'm seeing?
Larry, no!
LARRY:
Happy retirement.
Thanks for nothing.
Yeah.
Wishful thinking.
Oh, my God!
This is embarrassing.
(SINGING) What are you doing, honey?
What is it?
Oh, God.
What is it going to be?
Thank you very much.
I love you.
Uh-oh.
That feels a little...
Wait.
There's something strange about this.
Something doesn't...
I don't know what's going on.
Oh, no, it is!
It's trouble!
It's trouble!
It's trouble!
GUESTS:
Aw!
(SHOUTS)
This is the trouble.
Oh, you're adorable.
What are we gonna name her?
What do you think?
I got it.
I know what.
Dorothy.
Yeah.
Dorothy.
You're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.
Look.
Oh, my God.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
I thought you were watching the news, honey.
Nothing new about it.
It's all the same old stuff over and over.
I know.
But I think people feel safer when they hear things.
Look at these.
What do you think?
Well, they're kind of puny, but we got tomatoes.
How many did we get last year?
Six?
Seven?
Eight.
Eight?
That works out to be about nine dollars apiece.
We could have gone to the Four Seasons for less than that.
(LAUGHS)
I'm gonna go clean up.
Okay?
We can clean up tomorrow.
The people are coming tomorrow at 9:00, and Lily has given me a whole list of stuff that I have to do.
Nobody is going to be house hunting tomorrow.
We don't know that.
Would you buy an apartment this weekend?
You know, you're just as happy as you can be about all this bridge business, aren't you?
Well, of course, I planned this whole thing, so I could thwart Lily's open house tomorrow.
I wouldn't put it past you.
And, oh...
Don't forget you promised Lily you'd clean up your studio.
It looks like a mess, Alex.
Bomb detection unit is being brought on the scene with robots to check for such explosives in the tanker.
(PHONE RINGING)
Now the bridge is swarming with NYPD.
We have unconfirmed reports that there may be some sort of explosive device in the gasoline tank.
So what about this bridge business, anyway?
LILY:
Please, Aunt Ruth, I sold a loft in Tribeca the day after 9/11.
We might not get the usual hordes, but we'll get the serious ones and that'll work in our favor.
I will see you tomorrow at 8:30.
Good, okay, thank you.
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:... missing driver as Abdul Pamir.
MALE NEWS ANCHOR:
Now, we can show you a picture from Pamir's social networking site.
Isn't that a traditional Muslim hat he's wearing?
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
Yeah, Brian.
It's actually referred to as a kufi...
Oh, Lily's coming by with the first couple at 8:30.
Nothing stands in the way of real estate.
ALEX:
What did Lily call this?
Clutter.
Who'd have thought that the whole of my life's work would be worth less than the room I painted it in.
But how can I turn down a million dollars?
I have nothing else to leave Ruth besides all this clutter.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) Oh... (GROANS) Come on.
Okay.
Oh!
There.
(SIGHS)
Yes?
Oh, hello, Doctor.
Yes, this is she.
Dorothy's stabilized, so I'd like to operate on her first thing in the morning to minimize distress.
Honey?
Yeah.
The Doctor wants to operate on her tomorrow morning.
DR. KRAMER:
Yeah, now, she has a heart murmur.
Yes.
Yes.
I see.
Yes, of course.
He says the longer we wait the more stress there is on her heart.
What are the odds if they operate?
What are her odds?
Around 60-40.
60-40?
In her favor?
There's no guarantees, but one can't be certain.
RUTH:
Oh.
So do you want to go ahead with this?
Well, yes, we do.
I should tell you that the operation will be at least $10,000.
$10,000?
Yes.
Oh, well, that's a lot of money.
I don't really know...
Here.
Let me talk to him.
Oh.
Okay.
Doctor?
This is Mr. Carver.
Hello?
Hello?
What's the matter?
Doesn't work.
Hello?
What?
Oh!
Oh.
Is anyone there?
Doctor, this is Mr. Carver.
Yes.
Listen.
I want you to do whatever is necessary to save Dorothy.
Never mind what I signed.
The money doesn't matter.
Okay.
Just do whatever it takes.
Will do.
What?
You know what.
(CHUCKLES)
(MUTTERING SUGGESTIVELY)
(WHIMPERING)
D.J.:
It's a brand new day here at WZRZ.
Your place for New York talk.
Traffic is still snarled up on the Williamsburg Bridge.
We'll go out there with Cynthia Piermont soon.
But first, we have a studio full of newlyweds.
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
So we're learning now that the suspect, police source said,
Abdul Pamir is from Uzbekistan.
Hey.
Look at that.
What?
"Peril on the bridge!"
They make it sound like an amusement park ride or something.
Oh!
Several of Pamir's co-workers have come forward to say that he's a quiet, good-natured young man.
Who's screwing up the real estate market.
We're going now to Queens, where the family is about to make a statement.
Logan is reporting live from the scene.
PAMIR'S UNCLE:
Abdul Pamir is a devout, gentle and caring son.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Yes, he was born in Uzbekistan, but he became a proud American citizen two years ago.
All we want is for him to come home safe.
Hello.
This is Dr. Kramer, Mrs. Carver.
Oh, Dr. Kramer.
Uh...
Honey, honey.
It's Dr. Kramer.
The good news is Dorothy made it through the surgery fine.
But when she was waking up, she had a seizure.
(STAMMERS) A seizure?
It concerns me.
You have to keep in mind she's not a puppy.
Now, the anesthesia should wear off in the next couple of hours.
And I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
All right?
Thank you, Doctor.
(DOORBELL RINGING) Hey...
I mean, that's not good news.
Oh.
Okay.
Turn off the TV, honey.
Okay.
I don't want to see them.
Then go hide.
(SIGHS)
Good morning!
Hello.
Good morning.
These are the Schuylers.
This is Mrs. Carver.
Oh, please.
Call me Ruth.
Ruth.
I'm Jenny.
Well, good.
It's good to see you.
Come on in.
Where's Dorothy?
Well, she's recovering from surgery and...
Well, you know, you can have pets.
We don't do pets.
So do you see how the hallway expands the sense of space?
And would you look at the size of the kitchen.
You've got light coming from both directions.
You practically have to wear sunglasses when you have breakfast in here.
It's so bright.
So the master bedroom is this way.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) Master.
Hello.
Yeah.
Oh, we're looking at some place.
Reminds me of my grandmother's.
I know.
Who's gonna buy a place with the shit that's going on out there now?
So this is the laundry room.
Right.
And this is a really large hall closet.
I love the plank floors.
I always hated the parquet floors in our East Side place.
Uh-huh.
Who came up with the idea of parquet, anyway?
I don't know.
It's like walking on a board game.
RUTH:
I know.
This is the bathroom.
Only one?
I told you that, honey.
Jesus.
Yeah.
I'm listening.
The second bedroom.
Sorry.
Oh, hello.
Oh, this is my husband's studio.
And I'm her husband in his studio.
How do you do?
Yeah, hold on a second.
Oh, isn't this an amazing view, honey?
Yeah, it's good.
It could be a nursery.
Or a screening room.
She's right, honey.
There'd be a lot of room in here once we got all this stuff out.
No, I told you we weren't doing that.
Does anybody listen to me?
My husband is in the financial sector.
Oh.
Was.
Is.
We've had a rough couple of years.
That's why we had to sell our duplex uptown.
It's all right.
'Cause our therapist says we need to lower our expectations.
She said it'll be healthy for us.
It'd be good karma to live in a place like this.
Because we don't really need all that much.
I mean, who does, right?
Right.
You could always go live in a cardboard box under the bridge.
This street is very sought after.
Thank you for letting us see it first.
Please.
My pleasure.
Shall I show you out?
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
That was a good start.
Yeah, well, the others are gonna be better.
(LAUGHING) Couldn't be worse.
Stop.
Honey.
So there's good news, and there's bad news.
RUTH:
Okay.
Um...
They liked the apartment, or at least she does...
Ooh!
...which is usually what matters.
They love the neighborhood...
Mmm-hmm.
...but they're a little worried about the stuff on the bridge.
No.
But it's gonna be over in a week.
Yeah.
That's what I told them, but they said if it happens once...
What's happening?
NEWS ANCHOR:... that there is no bomb in the tanker.
However, police have not yet ruled out the idea that the suspect may be armed.
Are they still saying this guy is a terrorist?
They don't really know.
If you see something, say something today on this day, years after 9/11.
(INTERCOM BUZZING) Ah!
Next couple.
Hi.
Come on up.
Does he have a device with him?
Is he wearing a suicide vest?
We, of course, have more questions than answers.
Great.
My God.
It is true, though, Brian, that nothing is being ruled out until they find the suspect.
Of course, we can't confirm if there is actually a bomb.
Then why do you keep talking about it?
'Cause they make shit up as they go along.
That's why.
(DOORBELL RINGING) Oh!
Okay.
Okay.
Coming, coming, coming.
Okay.
Here we go.
Good news.
There is no bomb in the tanker.
Did they catch the driver?
No, not yet.
Mrs. Carver?
Yes.
And what's the name of your dog?
This is Harold.
Can I pet Harold?
No.
No, no!
He's wearing a vest.
Sorry.
He's in training to be a seeing eye dog.
He's still learning the difference between work and play.
Oh, Mrs. Carver, I'm Annie.
Annie Meyer.
Hello.
Well, you know, we have a dog.
He's not here now.
Well, no.
She's in the hospital.
She's recovering from surgery.
Oh, n...
Oh!
Whoa!
Harold, Harold!
Stop, Harold.
Heel!
Heel!
RUTH:
He must be smelling our dog.
Even so, he shouldn't be doing that.
Oh, he's young, Millicent.
Remember that next time he drags you under a truck.
Harold.
No!
Okay.
LILY:
Isn't this an amazing kitchen?
I mean, look at all the cabinet space, the light.
When you have breakfast in here, you're gonna practically have to wear sunglasses.
Am I right?
Maybe.
I don't know.
So let's go to the...
The living room is right through here.
Can I?
Sure, sure.
Oh, my God.
Don't touch the dog.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This is the living room.
Again, you see amazing light.
Oh, yes, it's beautiful.
And here is what I think is the...
Oh, Hello, there.
No, no, Harold.
No, Harold.
I'm so sorry.
He's not fully trained yet, so...
Oh, wow, what a great room.
Isn't it?
Thank you.
Harold, Harold, off.
Leave the paintings alone.
Oh, no, it's all right.
He might buy something.
Would you like to see the bedroom?
Okay.
Yes.
It's just through here.
Oh, that one is lovely.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Oh!
Sorry.
Oh, sorry.
Everybody's a critic.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Well, what do you think?
Oh, I've seen better.
Yeah.
Are you interested in buying?
Me?
God, no.
I just like to look.
I go to all the open houses.
I'm writing a book about them.
A book.
There you go.
LILY:
Thanks for coming.
(WHISPERS) People are very interested.
Are you sure about that?
Yeah, yeah.
MALE NEWS ANCHOR ON TV:
The search for Abdul Pamir is still underway.
There have been a number of unconfirmed sightings and cell phone photos, but he's still out there somewhere.
More good news from the bridge, though, Brian.
The tanker itself has been moved and all lanes reopened.
Excuse me.
Hmm?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh, please don't do that, sweetheart.
You're gonna break it.
We don't say "no" to Justin.
Well, I can say "no" to him, if you like.
We prefer to explain things to him.
Justin, do you know why it's inappropriate to flick the switch like that?
I don't give a shit.
Adorable.
Thank you.
Replace the French doors with glass.
The crown moldings have to go.
And see if the beams are decorative or actually structural.
Oh, can you tell me if the building association will let me see patients here?
What kind of patients?
I'm a psychotherapist.
You've come to the right place.
And this wall.
What does this wall do?
Hold up the ceiling maybe?
Thanks.
See if we can take down this bedroom wall.
Open it up a bit.
God knows it needs it.
Double pane the windows.
Make sure they get rid of all this crap.
Excuse me.
Oh, yes.
The tub in the bathroom.
What's the deal with the tub?
Oh, well, my husband and I were at Brentfield and we saw this antique...
Thanks.
Make sure that Roberto can take out the fixtures... (LAUGHING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV)
This came off.
Oh, well...
Thanks.
(LAUGHS) I hope you're keeping an eye on things.
I guess.
I wish they would turn the TV off.
Oh, I know.
I told them twice already.
I can't...
Maybe we should make popcorn.
Oh, no.
Not that.
Excuse me.
Did you paint the bathroom that color?
No.
We were out one night and someone broke in and painted the bathroom.
Is there a lot of crime in this neighborhood?
Did you notice that there's a window in the bathroom?
It's really particularly nice.
Come take a look.
(LAUGHS) What are you doing?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I think we should see about how Dorothy's doing.
No, no.
Yes.
The doctor said he would call as soon as he knew anything.
He did.
He...
Oh.
Excuse me.
Oh, yes.
Can I grow plants on the fire escape?
There's a roof.
Really?
Yeah.
And my husband grows plants up there.
Does he?
Yes.
Good for him.
I grow mine for medicinal reasons.
Oh.
Oh, hi.
I hope you don't mind.
I have to lie down in a bedroom before I know what it's like to sleep in it.
I mean, this is the position I'm gonna be in the most in here, isn't it?
I suppose so.
Oh, my God.
This is an awesome apartment.
We like it.
(SIGHS)
Would you mind just turning off that light?
No.
No.
Thank you.
(PIGEONS COOING)
(SIGHS)
(LAUGHS)
They make a lot of noise, don't they?
Well, not usually.
How long have you lived here?
40 years.
Wow.
40 years.
That's an awesome view.
Uh...
Yeah.
Yeah, we like it.
You looking to buy?
My mother is.
And which one is she?
She's probably lying down on your bed right now.
Really?
She always does that.
But don't worry.
She won't buy it.
Oh?
We don't have any money.
Oh, I see.
Why are you selling it?
That's a good question.
You have a dog?
Yeah.
She's in the hospital right now.
What's happened?
She's just old.
What's your name?
Zoe.
Zoe?
Mmm-hmm.
Pretty.
What's this?
(LAUGHING)
This, Zoe, (CLEARS THROAT) is called a turntable.
And it's used to play records.
These records are called LPs.
Stands for (BLOWS) long-playing.
The way it works is you take this stylus, there's a little needle in there, and very carefully place it on the record.
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
I like this song.
So do I.
Who's this?
That's my wife.
I like her glasses.
They were all the rage back then.
YOUNG ALEX:
How much does the school pay you to model?
Um...
Five dollars.
Well, 10, if it's more than three hours.
So take your time.
I could use the money.
I'm not going anywhere.
Not dressed like this, anyway.
You a vet?
Yeah.
Vietnam?
I don't like to talk politics or religion in the studio.
Oh, my God.
In my family, politics is a religion.
You ready?
Wait.
I wanna do something different with you first.
Should I call the cops?
How long have you had those glasses?
Oh, these?
I don't know.
Since I was a girl.
Here.
Put these on.
No.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, I won't be able to see through them.
Well, I'm the only person in the room who needs to see anything.
Yes, sir.
Take yours off.
Give them to me.
You're the first man I ever met who is more interested in getting my glasses off me than my clothes.
Give them to me.
Take them yourself.
Very cool.
That's the woman I wanna paint.
Why did you pick me?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Out of the modeling pool.
Like, why did you choose me?
'Cause Camille is much prettier than I am.
Everybody picks her, because, God, she's beautiful!
Beauty's not what I'm after.
Oh!
Well, that's a relief.
No, I mean, it's not the most important thing.
So what is?
You're real.
Good answer.
Start painting.
You got three hours.
(CHUCKLES)
Thanks so much.
And, again, my number is on the sheet, if you have any questions.
Thank you.
Thanks.
That was worse than I thought it was going to be.
You ought to make it one of the 10 plagues.
First, locusts, then house hunters.
Okay, so the dog ladies are interested.
I'm going for air.
You need anything?
Yeah!
No, we're out of milk.
Milk.
What?
What did you say?
The dog ladies are interested.
Okay.
So are the matching sweaters.
Both have asked for financials on the building.
But, honestly, I don't think we're going to get a real offer, while that madman's on the streets, you know?
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
It's later than I think.
Okay.
I'll be back in an hour.
We did good!
Right?
Did we?
I don't know.
We're with Debbie Hoffman, the 26-year-old bartender who spent several harrowing minutes last evening held hostage by suspected terrorist Abdul Pamir.
What exactly happened, Debbie?
I was about to take stock of the shop, and then this guy comes in.
And I tell him we don't open up for another hour, but he won't leave.
Did you see a bomb?
I don't know.
Could there have been a bomb under his jacket?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Then what happened?
He looks pretty scared.
And he goes up to the register and he takes out all the money.
Nearly 200 bucks.
And I yell at him to put it back.
But he didn't.
No.
He just mumbles something and he runs right out the door.
What was he saying?
You know, who knows?
I don't speak Muslim.
Thank you, Debbie.
She thinks Muslim is a language.
Well, there you have it.
A harrowing experience.
She ought to get a job with the Diplomatic Service.
(LAUGHING) NEWS ANCHOR:
Stay tuned.
We'll be right back...
It's Lily!
The dog ladies made an offer!
Really?
How much?
LILY: 850.
850?
Well...
So low?
It's an offer.
That's all.
Yeah.
I don't know.
What do you think?
Should we take this?
What's the rush?
What's the rush?
We've only been in the market 20 minutes.
Yeah, but I don't know.
I mean, if this guy blows himself up, we might not get a better offer.
Aunt Ruth has a point.
If this guy's a terrorist, I say we wait until this blows over or he blows himself up.
And then the prices go back to where they were.
Okay.
Whatever you want.
It's your call.
Oh, wait!
I'm getting another call!
Hello.
Don't you think we should think about it?
No, I don't.
No?
No.
Why not?
Because it's too low.
Okay.
That was the matching sweaters and they're offering to go as high as 875.
875?
But you have to decide now, because they don't want to get into a bidding war.
So the offer is only good for 15 minutes.
But what should we do?
So I'm gonna call the matching sweaters, and tell them about the dog ladies' offer.
And then I'm gonna call the dog ladies and just stall them.
This is getting confusing.
Relax!
This is what I do.
Mr. Hewitt?
I'm going to call the doctor.
He's gonna say that things are exactly as they were when you called an hour ago.
Ruth, you have got to learn to stop worrying.
But I like to worry.
It keeps me calm.
LILY:
Good news, bad news.
The dog ladies texted, they're thinking of dropping out.
Matching Sweaters said they need more time to discuss it.
What's the good news?
A third party has made a bid.
Who?
The woman with the blue leggings.
Okay, which one was that?
The psychiatrist.
Oh, her.
How much is she offering?
885.
Okay.
Should we take it?
You may have a bidding war on your hands.
And once that starts, reason goes out the window.
I have had couples practically offer me their firstborn.
I am gonna call back Dog Ladies and Matching Sweaters, tell them about our new bid.
Then I'm gonna call Blue Leggings and tell her we are considering her offer.
Oh, God.
LILY:
Hi...
What?
It's like we're talking about Indians in the Old West.
Blue Leggings and Lone Eagle.
Stop it.
Twin Sweaters and Running Trout.
Stop it.
Trout don't run.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) Okay!
Hold on.
Did you get my message?
WOMAN:
Yeah, but here's the thing.
I don't...
I understand.
I will, uh, ask them.
You should pay attention to her.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay!
We've got a...
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(GRUNTS) Hold on.
Um, hello?
WOMAN:
Lily?
Hi.
We'll go up to 886.
Yes.
886.
I will let them know.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
Okay!
Here's where we stand.
Matching Sweaters has offered 886.
See?
You were right.
LILY:
They're bid surfing.
They're trying to ride the crest of the big numbers.
But the first call I got was from the dog ladies.
What'd they say?
They wanna know what number you need in order to stop the bidding.
Well...
No, no, no.
Tell them to make their best offer, and we'll give it to whichever is highest.
That's the way it works.
Sounds good.
Ah!
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Lily Portman and Associates, please hold.
I'm gonna keep you posted.
If you go out, you take your cell phones with you.
Lily Portman.
How can I help?
Yes.
(SIGHS)
(CHUCKLING)
I'm going to miss all of this.
Look at it.
Then why are we moving?
I don't... (GROANS) (CELL PHONE RINGING)
Okay.
Wait.
Hello?
Yes, this is Dr. Kramer.
Dorothy's come around.
She's conscious and she's taking water.
Yeah.
That's wonderful.
But we haven't seen any movement in her legs yet.
That doesn't sound good.
Does it?
Look...
When can we come and see her?
Maybe tomorrow?
It might be good for her.
Why don't you come by tomorrow morning?
Well, that would be wonderful.
Thank you very much, Doctor.
Well?
Well.
She's putting up a fight.
Yeah.
What would you expect from our little girl, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She must be frightened though.
Yeah.
She doesn't know where she is.
She doesn't know where she's going.
Like us.
Mmm-hmm.
Like us.
May said they're gonna bring Jackson.
He's back from Hawaii.
Look at that.
God help us.
He's a nice boy.
He's not a boy.
He's a 49-year-old man living with his parents.
Off his parents.
All right, all right.
I know.
He's struggling, okay?
We're all struggling.
Honey, it might be a good time for you to talk to Larry about your paintings.
My clutter, you mean.
No.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I mean, when we move, we're going to have to do something about it.
Nobody wants that stuff.
Huh?
What?
Nobody wants...
No, you don't know that.
I'm going to throw it away, I think.
They're your life's work.
Oh, my God.
You never change, do you?
Larry said that he landed at 7:00.
So as long as the traffic's not too bad, then he will be there to meet you before he has dinner.
And, this guy, I mean.
He's very influential.
His reviews are...
They're all over the place.
Where are you going?
Home.
What?
Get back here!
You're the artist.
Everyone is expecting you there.
No one gives a shit about my work.
I do.
'Cause you have to.
No.
I don't.
Believe me.
We're gonna get there, the place will be empty.
My work is tedious.
It's derivative.
That was one critic.
Oh, my God.
You're such a baby.
I mean, is this what you're gonna be like every time you have a show?
No, because I won't have another show.
No one cares about my work.
Larry cares.
Only because he's my friend.
No.
He is showing up because he thinks he can make money selling it.
So you should stop whining, and just thank God that you have a friend like Larry.
Should thank May.
She's the one who bought him the gallery.
Oh, yeah?
Maybe you should have married a rich girl yourself.
Maybe I should have.
What did I do instead?
I fell in love with some girl from Brooklyn.
Ah, jeez.
You were right.
Empty.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Alex Carver, everybody!
Hi, Larry!
Thank you, Larry.
Hi.
So, anyway, tell us, how's work going?
He's ghost writing a book for someone.
Really?
Yeah.
It's a self-help book.
How do you ghost write a self-help book?
LARRY:
That's what I said!
It pays.
And that's all I care about.
Okay.
Right?
How did Dorothy's surgery go?
Okay.
Well, she's still not moving her legs.
I don't know what to say.
Oh, don't say that!
Oh, for crying out loud.
Mother!
For crying out loud what?
Mother...
You weren't this upset when Daddy was in the hospital.
Well, because she likes the dog more than she likes me.
Some days that's for sure.
Oh, here we go.
Table's ready.
Come, come.
You should leave something.
Oh, I forgot to tell you!
LARRY:
I'll take care of it.
It's on the bill.
We had the open house this morning.
LARRY:
People came?
They came.
They came in droves.
Small droves.
Okay.
Small droves.
RUTH:
Okay.
I'm sorry.
LARRY:
Should we tell them now?
MAY:
Sure.
Why not?
JACKSON:
Yeah.
Might as well.
Tell us what?
(CLINKING)
Oh.
Uh-oh.
I'm making Jackson my new partner in the gallery.
Really?
Yes.
Fishman and Son.
JACKSON:
Partners.
50-50.
That's terrific.
Thank you.
Isn't that wonderful?
RUTH:
Yeah, it is.
Oh, yes.
Jackson will bring a more youthful take on things.
Anyway, we were talking today about your show.
Well...
You tell him.
We love your stuff, Alex.
Everyone does.
I mean...
You've been successful now, what?
Thirty, 35 years?
Mmm.
But?
But right now your work is a hard sell.
I mean, the market is skewing younger these days.
Portraits are not high on people's shopping lists.
They'll come back.
Sure.
Mmm-hmm.
But right now they are not moving like they used to.
And the bottom line is, you wanna sell your stuff.
Don't you?
I'm sorry, Jackson.
I don't know.
Are we talking about selling art or selling stuff?
Don't shoot the messenger.
No, because artists really don't paint to satisfy "the market."
You see what I mean?
Artists actually paint to satisfy themselves.
And if you're going to run a gallery, you know, it's something you need to know.
Relax, Ruth.
Yeah, I will.
Jackson is running a business.
Don't worry.
Exactly.
Exactly.
See, a gallery is a business.
I get what you're saying.
You're saying that Alex should paint what people want him to paint.
That's right.
That's right.
RUTH:
And then maybe when you have a prospective client lined up, you and Alex can go and you can visit the client's apartment.
And you can see the room where they want to hang the painting.
And you can get some color samples of the wall paint.
Fun.
No, that's not what I meant.
Jackson?
Jackson?
Ruth is pulling your leg.
No, she's not.
No.
I'm not.
I'm not.
You were hard on Jackson.
Well, he better get used to it, if he's going to work with artists.
He's just like Lily.
He just wants us to go away.
Okay.
Well, if they do, then it's up to us to let them know that we're not gonna go anywhere.
I don't wanna move to Florida and play shuffleboard.
Or live on some bullshit golf range, a million miles from everything we know.
Nobody's gonna go live in Florida.
Then where are we gonna go?
We don't wanna wake up and find ourselves out on the street.
Oh, for God's sakes!
Nobody's gonna wake up on the streets.
Alex, why do you always have to be so melodramatic all the time?
I just don't like our lives being in the hands of somebody else.
Well, then fine!
Let's do something about it, all right?
Let's take things into our own hands!
All right.
How do we do that?
Look at us.
We've always done what we wanted to, haven't we?
Yeah.
Right?
We got married when it was still illegal in 30 states.
And people kept staring at us in the other 20.
Right?
So tell me, what's finding an apartment in comparison to that?
So let's just go get ourselves a newspaper and start looking.
And what are you laughing at?
What are you doing?
Why are you laughing at me?
You're reminding me of that girl with the glasses that I painted so long ago.
Yeah?
Yes.
Well, here she is.
And I'll tell you one thing.
You're not gonna get my clothes off so easily this time, mister.
Wanna bet?
RUTH:
Oh, I've got it.
ALEX:
Okay.
All right.
I've got it.
Take this.
I got it, I got it.
Oh.
Wait a minute now.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Where is...
No, no.
Look at this.
No.
No.
Where?
Here.
Here.
Here.
Here.
It says this one's...
Franklin Street?
Mmm-hmm.
"Cute"?
What's that mean?
That means it's small.
Oh.
So wait a minute.
What about over here?
Oh, no.
Here's one.
Here's one.
Here's one.
Look at this one in Brooklyn.
It's in Brooklyn.
Uh...
Two bedrooms, lots of space and light.
Old world charm.
That sounds great, doesn't it?
That's our listing, Alex.
Oh.
Well, in that case, we should be able to get it cheap, right?
You think?
Yeah!
Why not?
(LAUGHING) Don't get smart.
(ALEX SINGING)
YOUNG RUTH:
What did Dad say?
Oh, your father.
He's unsettled.
He's unsettled?
Honey, he thinks you're too young.
I'm older than you were when you got married.
(SIGHS)
And what about you?
What do you think about me marrying Alex?
I don't have an opinion.
Of course you do.
What is it?
I'm satisfied.
You're satisfied that I'm getting married?
What do you want?
I want you to be satisfied with that sundae that you're eating.
You know, I want you to be satisfied with the soda that you're drinking.
But you're my mother.
So I want you to be overjoyed that I'm marrying Alex.
You know, at least, I want you to be happy for me.
I'm trying.
Try harder.
Mom is only trying to say that this marriage is gonna be difficult, Ruth.
And what marriage isn't?
There's still so much prejudice, and...
Oh, really, Sarah?
Thank you for telling me.
Think of your children.
Think of your children.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sweetheart.
You can tell Dad that he doesn't want to make me choose between my family and Alex.
Because if he does, you can tell him that my choice is already made.
(SINGING)
"And foolish though it may seem to me."
This one sounds really nice.
Listen.
"Dazzling sun-filled corner two-bedroom, built-in bookcases,
"window seats, soaks up the morning sunshine."
That's nice.
Yeah.
Where is it?
It's on 73rd and First.
Do we want to live in Manhattan?
Well, I mean, I think it would be a good change for us.
And we'd be close to Larry and May's place, too.
And how much is it?
It's...
Well, it's a lot.
It's one million, one hundred thousand dollars.
Okay, but...
We can't afford that.
Yes, but there's no harm in looking, honey.
No harm in looking.
RUTH:
Oh...
ALEX: (WHISPERING) Look at her.
She recognizes us, honey.
Look at this girl.
Hello.
She hasn't walked yet.
But she's obviously happy to see you.
Of course she is!
Of course she is!
Hey.
Hey.
Look at her.
She's bandaged up.
Can I touch her, Doctor?
Yeah, of course.
Oh, yes.
You're so good.
You hang in there, kiddo.
You hang in there, you hear me?
You're such a good girl.
Hang in there.
Good girl.
That a girl.
I know she's gonna walk.
I know it.
Of course she is.
She's a fighter like you.
Like us.
So what's a junior bedroom?
What do you mean?
Does it have bunk beds?
Well, if it does, you get the top one.
Okay, honey?
This is it.
This is it.
You're kidding.
Yeah.
No, this is it.
It sure sounded better in the paper, didn't it?
We're wasting our time.
No, come on.
We're here.
Well, let's just look.
Okay?
Wait a second.
Which...
(DOOR BUZZING)
It buzzed.
Oh, it did.
Okay.
Got it.
4C. 4C.
Oh, 4C?
Are you sure?
That's what the sign said.
Okay.
That's the...
Come on.
Okay.
All right.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Wow.
Don't even bother.
Let me check this... (ELEVATED TRAIN PASSING)
It's you again.
Hmm.
I'm afraid so.
It's not as nice as your place.
It's not, is it?
Where's your mom?
Where do you think?
Lying down on the bed.
(CHUCKLING)
How's your dog doing?
Well, she survived the operation, but still hasn't moved her hind legs.
She will.
You think so?
Yeah.
I know things like that.
I see.

I'm gonna go get my mom.
MALE NEWS ANCHOR:
...this time in a taxi.
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
We're going now to Logan Crawford, who is reporting from underneath the FDR with the abandoned taxi.
What's going on?
Pamir.
He hijacked a taxi.
When?
This morning.
Really?
REPORTER:... reporting underneath the FDR Drive.
The driver reported that Mr. Pamir seemed very nervous and he kept on asking, "What are the police doing?"
He also asked about his family and seemed to be saying a prayer.
I don't know.
I think that we should take the 885 that Blue Leggings is offering.
No, we don't want to rush into anything.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's them!
Did you see, honey?
Yeah.
They're not interested in our place anymore.
Now, you don't know that.
Yeah, well they're here, aren't they?
They're just hedging their bets.
Wouldn't you?
This whole thing.
Oh, please.
It's just making me so nervous.
(SIGHS)
(ELEVATOR THUMPING)
So do you wanna see this place?
Not if it's as bad as the last one.
Well, don't be discouraged.
We're just looking.
Yes.
I didn't know how bad it could be.
It's in the neighborhood.
Remember?
You remember it.
It's the sunny two-bedroom.
Yes.
It's probably in a basement.
(LAUGHING)
It's in the basement.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think this is it.
Oh!
This looks nice.
And it's on the ninth floor!
We've never lived that high up before.
What's his...
I know what it is.
It said Vincent, right?
Here we go.
Yeah.
I think that's it.
(DOOR BUZZING)
There we go.
There we go.
Oh!
Oh, sorry.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Here's a flyer for you, if you want to take that with you.
Sure.
Oh!
Oh, this is so much nicer.
Really.
Didn't I tell you?
Yup.
I mean, look at this entranceway.
I love this kind of an entranceway, honey.
And what about the light?
Yeah.
Very good.
It's not even that bright out today.
Honey, I'm gonna go find some water and take my pill.
All right, all right, all right.
Hey.
(LAUGHS)
(GRUNTS)
Piece of shit.
Here.
Oh, hey, you.
Why do they make it so hard to open?
Childproof.
Of course.
Do you like this place?
It's the best we've seen so far.
Put that back for me.
But it's still not as nice as yours.
Nothing is.
I hope you find a place you like.
So do I.
And when we do, I'm going to invite you to tea.
How is that?
Cool.
Oh!
Sorry.
Okay, I like this place.
I really do.
I really like it a lot.
Come here.
I want to show you something.
Just see this room.
Look at this, honey.
Look.
Oh!
Yes.
I'm gonna talk to the agent.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm doing it.
Yeah.
ALEX:
Nowhere is going to have a view like our place.
But maybe Ruth and I have seen all the views we need to.
Maybe views are for younger people who still have things to look at.
Okay.
We'll look to hear from you guys this afternoon.
Thank you.
Here she is.
Here she is.
Oh, hi.
Excuse me.
Actually, my husband and I are very interested.
Well, I don't have to tell you, this listing is getting a lot of heat.
Oh, yes.
We can see that.
Let me be frank with you.
Can you afford a place like this?
What do you mean?
I only ask, because no one's gonna give you a 30-year mortgage.
We don't need a mortgage.
Oh!
Well, then make an offer.
The owners are willing to consider anything.
But they're only accepting bids until 3:00.
That's two hours.
Mmm-hmm.
Have your offer here by then.
They'll make their decision right away.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Ma'am?
Yes?
A lot of people include a personal message with their offer.
What kind of personal message?
Something that persuades the seller to give it to you, in case there's a tie.
Just don't be afraid to pull on the heartstrings.
Oh.
Right.
RUTH:
How do you like that one talking to us like we don't know anything?
I bet we've got more real money than all those young hotshots anyway.
But I just want to know.
What did you think of it?
I liked it.
Really?
Yeah.
Let's bid on it.
How?
We haven't sold our own place yet.
No, but we will.
We will.
We had a bunch of offers.
And you heard the real estate broker say that they are very willing to consider anything until 3:00.
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.
Any offer that's, like, until 3:00.
It's a beautiful apartment.
Yeah, it's all right.
It has a lot of light.
Yes.
It has light.
It has an elevator.
And more room.
New paint.
Honey, come on.
Let's do it.
Come on.
It sounds like something you really want.
YOUNG ALEX:
In that case, we'll see another doctor.
What for?
He'll say the same thing the others did.
Maybe not.
Alex, you know he will.
It's the most natural thing in the world and I can't even do it.
My mother, my sisters, they churn them out like machines, one after another.
We don't need children.
No one needs children, Alex.
People want them.
I want them.
You want them.
(YELPS)
Shit!
Shit!
(GROANS)
I am a goddamned failure.
You are not a failure.
I've disappointed you.
You've never disappointed me, Ruth.
I can see it in your face.
Stop saying that.
You have classrooms full of children, those are your kids.
That's not the same thing.
Then me.
I'm your kid.
You're always telling me what a big baby I am.
Well, you are.
(SNIFFLES)
You really like it, don't you?
I do.
And, honey, admit it.
You do, too.
I mean, I know...
I know...
Wait a second.
I know it's not our place, but we're never gonna find another place like our place.
And we won't find anything better than this.
So, Alex, I mean, it's just...
What is it?
It's a bid.
It's not a commitment.
It's like...
You know, we're not going to find...
They're never going to take it.
Trust me, they're never going to take it.
All right, fine.
Let's do it.
Really?
Yeah.
Should we call Lily?
No.
I mean, you said you thought we should do this ourselves.
So I think we should, but be smart.
What do you think we should offer?
Well...
I mean...
Not so low that we have no chance.
I know.
But not so high that we're stuck with something that we can't afford.
So what would be the point of that, right?
Right, yeah.
I don't know.
Look, this is what I think.
I think $900,000.
That's too low. $910,000.
You think?
I don't know.
Well, uh...
You think?
$910,000?
$920,000.
No, $920,000.
No, but that's too much.
That's way too much.
Honey, do you want the place or not?
Yes.
I definitely want the place.
I want to be in the running.
Yes.
So $920,000.
$920,000.
No. $925,000.
It's more impressive.
Whoa!
Listen to you!
What?
You sound like you're some sort of an auctioneer!
Twenty-five?
Okay, do I hear $930,000?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, $930,000.
$930,000?
That's a lot better.
I mean, so what the heck?
It's just money.
RUTH:
This is hard to write, when I don't know exactly what these people are like.
Tell them I'm senile and I want to live by the zoo.
Be serious, please.
How about donating a park bench with their name on it?
(LAUGHS) Okay.
Just tell them we love the place.
Breaking news.
The bartender, Debbie Hoffman, who claimed that Pamir robbed her cash register has now been charged with theft and misleading police after she admitted that she took the money.
Yeah.
I knew there was something wrong with that.
Alex?
Oh, my God.
Alex?
What?
We got the apartment!
What?
Already?
Yeah.
Isn't that wonderful?
Now, they want us to come over with the check right now.
Right now?
That's what they said.
I don't know.
You don't know what?
I mean, I think we should wait.
For what?
Well, we don't wanna be giving our money to somebody with all this going on.
You know what?
We're gonna lose this apartment.
That's what we're gonna do.
We're not gonna lose it.
Well, what am I going to say to the real estate broker?
Just tell them we...
We...
We...
What?
Tell them we can't get there right now.
They're gonna take the next best offer, Alex.
No, they won't.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Yes, they are.
No, they won't.
Uh...
Wait.
Don't pick it up.
Don't!
Don't pick it up.
Why?
MIRIAM ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
The sellers are getting anxious.
If we don't hear from you soon, they're going to open up the bidding again.
You heard what she said.
They're gonna reopen the bidding.
She's bluffing.
She's not bluffing.
Right now we're the only ones that are bluffing.
Come on, honey.
We've gone this far.
We can't back down now.
The last thing we need, Ruth, is for somebody else to be pushing us into something.
Nobody is pushing us into anything.
Take things into our own hands.
That's what you said, honey.
I know what I said.
Will you please look at me?
All day yesterday I heard you complain about being treated like garbage and ending up on the streets.
And then finally last night, we decide to make a move, but only if we have total control.
So we look at a few places.
And then finally...
Finally we get excited about one, we make an offer and Io and behold we get it.
We actually get the place.
And now you wanna back down?
Listen, if you wanna take control, this is how we take control, honey!
All I'm saying, Ruth, is this is a lot of money!
I know!
But if we walk away from this we'll just be acting like a couple of old fools!
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hey?
Oh, my God!
Oh.
Everybody is still crazy out there.
I wish they would go ahead and find this guy already.
Jesus.
All right.
Here's where we are.
Blue Leggings is our last solid bid at 885.
But the dog ladies have called and they wanna come by in a few minutes with a counter bid.
Apparently, they wanna do it in person, because they wanna make some kind of...
What's the matter?
Oh!
Aunt Ruth, what happened?
We saw a place this morning.
What do you mean you saw a place?
We went to an open house this morning and we loved it.
You went to an open house today?
If you knew you were ready to look...
I don't understand.
Why didn't you call me first?
What?
Wait.
We don't need to be asking you for permission.
No, I realize that, but I have listings, too.
I have stacks of listings and I have done a lot of work for you.
This isn't the easiest market.
Why didn't you call me first, Aunt Ruth?
I'm sorry, Lily.
I really am sorry.
I don't know what I was...
It wasn't her idea.
It was mine.
You know, an apartment might not be the best idea for you right now.
There are other...
Bullshit!
Wait a minute now!
We'll decide where we're going to live.
Okay.
Okay.
Have it your way.
Where is it?
This place that you like so much?
It's in Manhattan.
Yeah, it's on 73rd and First.
It's just so beautiful.
And how much is it?
A million, one.
A million, one!
Mmm-hmm.
I don't know.
We made an offer.
I don't believe this.
Well, they accepted it.
Well, what did you offer?
$930,000.
And they took it?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's not bad.
Oh.
So we're not such fools after all, huh?
Okay.
Okay.
Uh...
Let's get real here for a minute.
So nobody buys an apartment nowadays before they sell their own.
Especially not with what's going on out there.
Who's the agent?
I have the card.
Wait, I know where it is.
I know I have it.
I know where it is.
Wait.
A woman, or...
No, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Yeah.
Oh.
Okay.
Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam...
Carswell?
(GASPS) She's a shark!
What?
She's gonna eat you for breakfast!
What did she say?
They want the deposit.
Well, of course they do.
When?
Right now.
What did you tell them?
Well, we haven't called her back yet.
No, but wait a minute.
We want this apartment.
Well, then it is crucial that you sell this place fast!
Okay.
Okay, give me a minute to think this through.
Um...
I'm gonna...
Yeah!
I'm gonna call Miriam.
Okay.
Let me handle her.
RUTH:
Oh, God, she is upset.
LILY:
Hey, Miriam...
I don't know why she couldn't talk to them in front of us.
I hope we haven't stepped on her toes.
I don't want them making deals behind our backs.
I really didn't know the protocol.
We just saw an apartment we liked and...
Well, she'll live.
Okay, here's where we stand.
I convinced Miriam that you're serious, but that you have to rest.
I reminded her how old you are.
I reassured her that we would all be there by 5:00 with the deposit.
Okay.
What time is it, though?
What time do we...
It's 3:30.
And the dog ladies will be here any second, so...
Wait, wait, Lily.
Now, aren't we moving a little quickly here?
May I remind you that you're the ones who want to buy a new apartment.
This is how it works.
Dog eat dog.
You snooze, you lose.
Okay.
(SIGHS) And one more thing,
I told Miriam that I'm the one who steered you to her listing.
So if she asks, back me up.
The least you can do is help me get a piece of the commission on it, right?
Well, sure.
I mean, obviously.
That's only fair, Lily.
(SIGHS) Okay.
So let me know as soon as you hear the dog ladies' offer.
And keep your fingers crossed that it's at least $950,000, because that's what we need to make this work.
9-5-0.
Otherwise we're screwed.
Man!
She really does talk too much.
Authorities may be one step closer to catching the terror suspect Abdul Pamir.
Police have released security camera footage
(DOORBELL RINGING) that appears to show Pamir looking over his shoulder and showing obvious concern.
Oh, God.
Doorbell.
I know.
I know.
Move it.
Move it, handsome.
Why, hello.
Hi.
I hope you don't mind us just stopping by like this.
We were training Harold in the park.
We're here to make an offer.
Oh, well, please come in.
Would you like something to drink?
Anything?
Oh, no.
We don't want to intrude.
Just give them the bid, Annie.
Yes.
So this is as high as we can go.
How is your dog doing?
Mmm...
Well, it's actually kind of touch-and-go, so...
ANNIE:
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Harold's actually not doing so well, either.
In school.
He has a learning disability.
We think.
Oh.
Give her the...
Well, they...
Here you go.
So this is our letter.
In case there's a tie.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh, Harold.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Harold, you concentrate, now.
Do you hear me?
(LAUGHS)
Don't open that letter till you've read their offer.
What?
I said don't open that letter till you read their offer.
No, I won't.
Will you please open it?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Oh.
Hello.
Hi, Lily.
Yep.
The offer is $950,000.
All right.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
That's good.
$950,000.
Mmm-hmm.
Fine.
That's good.
All right.
Bye.
That is absolutely wonderful.
We can make this work.
Is Lily gonna call them and give them the good news?
She's gonna call the others first and see if they wanna make a counter offer.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Yeah?
What?
No.
Tell them they can keep their lousy $1,000.
Hang on.
Hang on.
What?
Lily?
Lily, what happened?
LILY:
The matching sweaters offered $951,000.
But here's the good news.
Dr. Gilbert's gonna e-mail you a counter offer.
Wait.
Okay.
But who is Dr. Gilbert?
Blue Leggings.
Oh, no.
Let me know what it is as soon as you get it.
We have to get over to the other place in half an hour.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay.
Bye.
Will you check the e-mail?
Yeah.
I know how to use the Internet.
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. Carver..."
My partner and I moved to New York only a few years ago.
And as you probably know better than most, it's not always been easy for us.
We've been trying to adopt for nearly six years and it looks like we'll finally have a baby daughter.
A little girl from India.
Your husband's studio would make such a wonderful room for her.
Full of light and love.
Please consider letting us live in your wonderful home.
ALEX:
Shoot.
Honey, what?
Ruth, do this.
Um...
No, let me get it.
Let me get it for you.
Let me get it.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You do it.
You do it.
It's all right.
Got it.
Got it, got it.
Okay, well.
Blue Leggings made an offer.
What is it?
$960,000.
Nine...
That's good!
Uh...
I don't know.
Yeah.
What?
You're disappointed?
No.
It's just...
Honey, I read the dog ladies' letter.
And I just think we should give them a chance to counter offer.
Just...
Ruth, you heard that lady say this was their final offer.
See, I told you not to read that letter.
I know.
But they're adopting a little girl.
These people are offering $10,000 more!
But do we really want someone like that living here?
Honey?
Do we?
I'm just asking.
Ruth?
We're talking 10 grand.
All day we've been throwing numbers back and forth, like they don't mean anything.
850, 900, 950.
Sugar, we're not rich.
We need to get a grip on reality here.
I know.
You're right.
It's just...
I wish we could give it to them.
I wish a lot of things.
I wish we could give our apartment to whoever needed it.
I wish we could give it to that lady on the bed and her little girl.
Most of all, I wish I could run up and down the damn stairs, like I used to, for the rest of my life.
(CHUCKLES)
(CELL PHONE RINGING) Ugh.
Okay.
It's right there.
I got it.
I got it.
Here it is.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, Doctor.
What?
Really?
What?
What?
(SOBS) Really?
She walked.
She walked?
She walked?
Yes.
Dorothy walked!
I knew she would.
High-five.
Yes.
(WHIMPERING)
Let me tell you.
What?
Once I give them this check...
Yeah.
...there's no turning back.
I know.
Everything is different.
Good different, honey.
Good different.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Now, wait.
Okay, here it is.
MRS. VINCENT ON INTERCOM:
Who is it?
Oh, my husband and I are here with the deposit.
Hello?
Hello, there!
You sure you got the right apartment?
I'm sure.
Yeah.
Hello?
We've come to buy the apartment!
Yes, we're...
Your broker!
We're meeting with your broker!
She told us to meet her here!
MRS. VINCENT:
I know who you are.
Your agent isn't here yet.
You can wait for her outside.
Oh, that's nice.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am going to call Lily.
'Cause that's rude.
No, no, no.
Here comes somebody.
Oh, good.
That's just...
I'm calling Lily.
Lily!
Oh!
It's show time.
(GROANS)
Okay.
I don't want to take it.
I want to wait.
We have to take it.
We can't wait.
(DOORBELL RINGING) Who the hell is that?
MIRIAM:
That's their agent.
I said not later than 5:00.
I'm coming!
For Christ's sake.
Great.
They've been holding us hostage all afternoon, now they can't wait to get in.
Hi!
Hi.
How did you get in?
Uh...
Gentleman with the dog.
So much for security.
Come on in.
Oh.
Thank you.
LILY:
This is Mrs. Carver.
Hi.
This is Mr. Carver.
I'm Lily Portman.
Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
I'm Lily Portman.
How are you?
I need to talk to my wife.
This is Mrs. Carver...
Sure.
Let's just go inside then.
Okay.
Thank you.
Great.
I don't want to take the offer.
I don't want to take it.
We don't have to take it.
I know.
Fine.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's get down to business.
Hey, Miriam.
Hello.
So we have the deposit check.
Great.
What if we refuse it?
Why would you refuse it?
Hold on.
'Cause maybe we want to open the bidding back up.
Why would you want to do that?
So we can get better offers.
These two have been holding us hostage all afternoon.
Nobody's been holding you hostage.
Okay.
All right.
Relax, everybody.
They're here now.
And this is the best offer you've gotten.
Especially while all that shit drags on out there.
If you refuse my client's check, it will be up to the courts to decide.
Your kid could be out of college by the time this thing is resolved.
Is that what you want?
Take his damn check.
Okay.
This way.
Do they even know what they're doing?
We know what we're doing.
Who do I make it out to?
Stephen Vincent.
Is that a "P-H" or a "V"?
P-H!
Something's happening.
Oh!
It's the terrorist thing!
MR. VINCENT:
What's happening?
It looks like they found him or something.
NEWS ANCHOR:
Logan, what do you see?
Oh, my God!
And the suspect in this terrorism plot, Abdul Pamir...
In fact, there he is right now.
I can see him.
He's coming out.
That's him.
He has his hands over his head.
Yeah.
Wow.
RUTH:
Uh-oh.
He appears to be surrendering.
Now police is sending in a canine unit to sniff the suspect, to see if there is actually a bomb or device.
There is a dog checking the suspect now.
Wait a second.
He seems very calm.
That might be a bomb there, though.
The dog has walked off now.
That means there is likely no device, no bomb.
MR. VINCENT:
Get him off the streets for good.
Very, very good news indeed.
MRS. VINCENT:
That's his white flag.
Wow.
MIRIAM:
It's good they got him.
MR. VINCENT:
Lock him up.
You can hear the choppers up ahead as well.
New York City's Finest is doing their job and they have got their man.
And they are about to put the bracelets on him.
Shoot the son of a bitch.
Right in the balls.
Come on.
Look at him.
Heck, he's just a kid!
Well, what did you expect?
I don't know.
A monster.
Anything but this.
What did he really do?
That little prick cost me 50 grand.
That's what he did.
MRS. VINCENT:
You need to let it go.
We can all rest easier now, knowing this terrorist is off our streets.
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
Isn't it a little bit too early to actually convict this young man?
RUTH:
The poor guy.
MIRIAM:
Poor guy, my ass!
MR. VINCENT:
I knew we should have waited.
MRS. VINCENT:
You are the one that said to take the first decent offer that we got.
LILY:
I remind you.
You are obligated to take my client's offer.
Yes?
MIRIAM:
Yes.
MR. VINCENT:
Just...
All right.
Just sign the thing already.
LILY:
We're gonna sign.
Just sign where indicated, Mr. Carver.
I'm not signing.
Alex, are you all right?
What do you mean you're not signing it?
I mean I'm not signing the damn thing.
What's he talking about?
Jesus Christ.
Give me a break.
We don't want your apartment.
Alex, what are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing, Lily?
I'm putting an end to this bullshit.
All day long we've been pulled back and forth, back and forth.
Only to come up here and hear these two accuse us of I don't know what!
Nobody is accusing you of anything.
I understand that's what...
No...
Whoa, whoa.
Wait.
Please.
Let him finish, okay?
We don't want your apartment.
Put it back on the market.
I hope they get a billion dollars for it!
You know, when one door closes, another door opens.
Okay.
Thank you, Lily.
Thanks.
(STAMMERS)
Alex?
Alex?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I gotta get out of here.
No...
Wait a second.
Wait.
You can't just storm off like that.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Ruth.
But seeing that young man, kneeling on the ground like that.
It just made me realize that we're just like everybody else today.
Getting all worked up over nothing.
Yeah.
Why are we moving?
What are we chasing?
Haven't we built a good life?
I only meant to help.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I know that.
I know.
I know, Ruth.
You know, you're probably gonna live to be 100.
Mmm-hmm.
I hope so.
I don't want to live without you.
And I really don't care.
You know that, right?
I don't care if we stay in Brooklyn or we move to Moscow.
I just want what's best for you.
And us.
Let's go home.
God, I love you, you silly old man.
(GASPS)
I don't know what just went down in there, but it could work for us.
You lost this place.
It doesn't matter.
I've got plenty of others.
The good news is that you didn't accept any of the offers on your apartment.
And what he said is true, things are gonna go up, now that that idiot's off the streets.
And we could hold out for a million dollars.
Maybe more.
No, Lily...
No?
No, what?
Too much?
No.
It's too little!
We're not holding out, Lily.
We're not selling.
What do you mean?
I've got solid offers.
I can get you better ones.
You can't back out now.
Lily, we can do whatever the hell we want.
But...
Selling is the right thing for you.
It's the right thing for you.
You're just acting this way, because you're scared.
We're not scared.
We're doing it, because it's the right thing to do.
And he's right, Lily.
We don't need to sell right now.
Will you just...
Will you just stop for a minute?
What?
Listen, you cannot live in that apartment forever.
We can't live anywhere forever.
No, but we can manage there for a while.
This is ridiculous.
What about all the work I put in, Ruth?
There's just really nothing more to say.
I'm sorry.
Well, then I'm gonna say it.
You're a crazy old man, who doesn't know what's good for you.
Hey, no, you do not speak to him like that!
And you're no better!
Fuck you both!
I guess we won't be going to her place for Thanksgiving this year.
You hate her stuffing, anyway.
ALEX:
It took a while for Dorothy to get back on her feet.
But, by the time winter set in, she and I had returned to our usual routine.
(WOMAN LAUGHING)
Hi.
I thought that was you two.
Hey.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing, honey?
Look at you.
Did you manage to get any paint on the walls?
Funny.
(BARKS)
What?
Didn't that bad man feed you?
ALEX:
Yes.
She ate.
She doesn't think so.
Well, she is either confused or lying.
Here.
How's it going in there?
Oh, thanks.
Well...
Uh, it's going.
Good.
Mmm-hmm.
Can I see?
Mmm-hmm.
See, nobody told me that painting would be this hard.
Oh, jeez.
I'm sorry about that.
Not sorry enough.
What do you think?
Huh?
It's good, huh?
Yeah.
It looks very good.
I like it better than this gray that you chose.
Thanks.
Why are you still painting this old lady?
What old lady?
Ooh.
Good answer.
Look at that.
ALEX:
Those few days were like one big roller coaster ride.
And, like most rides, we ended up where we began.
Still, it reminded us who we are.
What we have.
It was worth it, if only for that.
Maybe one day we'll sell.
Stop climbing the stairs.
But for now we'll just deal with what is.
The important thing is it brought us back here.
Together.
Back to our senses.
And to our home.
it was like an outpost.
To our friends in Manhattan, we might as well have moved to Nebraska.
It was out of fashion, but a good place for a struggling artist like me.
And we liked it, which was good because-- Good morning.
it was all we could afford.
Morning, Mr. Rahim.
Good morning.
Mr. Carver.
Good morning, Dorothy.
So, tomorrow's the big day.
You ready to move?
I don't know.
I would get out of here in a minute if I could.
Ah.
Where would you go?
Where would I go?
New York is the best city in the world.
Hello?
Hello?
Ruth?
It's like talking to somebody on the wreck of the Titanic.
Ruth?
Hello?
Ruth?
Ruth?
Uh, what am I looking for in here?
Oh-
- Uh, I'm losing you.
Alex, stop moving around.
Are you near the door?
Listen to me.
Yeah.
It's in the rack.
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Lily's coming, so I gotta go.
Yeah, she's here.
So I'll talk to you later.
You'll be fine.
Aunt Ruth, I don't know how you and Alex do it.
I'm 40-whatever, and look at me.
Jesus, I gotta--.
I gotta join a gym.
Thank you.
Uh, excuse me.
Where is the Times?
Aunt Ruth, hide this.
We're gonna see a lot of action tomorrow.
Your mother gave that to me.
Well-- I wish she hadn't smoked so much.
Guess people don't really give ashtrays as gifts anymore, do they?
I don't know if people even make them anymore.
So, the shades all have to be up.
Oh.
Light is money.
Remember that.
How many people will come, do you think?
Who knows.
But what we want are the serious ones.
Oh.
You always get the lookers, the people who just come to see how other people live.
It makes them feel better about their lives.
Or worse.
Who knows.
So, when you're trying to sell, you don't want any clutter.
Uh-huh.
Less is more.
All the books gotta go away.
Chekhov.
The Lady with the Dog.
This was my favorite story to teach.
Uh-huh.
The girls loved it, but I remember the boys.
not so much.
Did you get Uncle Alex to change his mind?
Oh.
He's still on the fence about it.
But you know artists-- too much practicality overwhelms them.
Ah.
I'll get him there.
Because, you know, you're looking at maybe a million dollars.
Give or take.
Yeah.
Two years ago it would've been more.
with the feeding frenzy then.
Neighborhood's changed a lot.
It's cool now, filled with hipsters.
And gentrifiers.
Mothers with baby strollers that cost as much as a Chevy.
And their banker husbands, their heads buried in their smartphones.
Crossing the street while you're trading stocks and bonds doesn't seem that smart to me.
Hey.
Watch where you're goin'.
The neighborhood's just got itself a Whole Foods.
All it needs now is the ultimate sign of modern civilization-- an Apple store.
But as much as it's changing.
I'm gonna miss this place.
Come on, Dorothy.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Come on now.
Come on.
That's a good girl.
Good morning, Mr. Carver.
Oh, hi, Erica.
Are you all ready for the open house?
Uh, I guess so.
It's not the same market it was a few years ago.
you know.
Well, we're just testing the water.
What you're gonna want to do tomorrow first thing, when you wake up-- Mm-hmm?
Turn this on and let it simmer.
Gives the whole apartment a homey feel.
Okay.
Works every time.
Mmm.
Well--.
Let's hope a lot of people are gonna love this apartment tomorrow.
This is a young people's building, you know.
The stairs?
Come on.
I know you're tired.
So am I. Come on.
I know.
Come on.
Here.
Let me try it.
I know how to put a key in the door, but--.
Got it.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Carrying my bride across the threshold.
What bride?
We've been married two years.
You still like it?
Like it?
I love it.
Oh, look at all this light.
Hi.
I'm Alex Carver.
My wife and I, we just moved in.
And you didn't when-
- Oh.
Hey, Alex.
Hey, Dorothy.
Hey.
Did you have a good walk, sweetie?
Big day tomorrow.
You all set?
Yes.
- What is that smell?
- Oh, that's cinnamon.
It gives the place a homey feel.
Smells like a whorehouse.
Is that a fact?
Yes.
And what does a whorehouse smell like, sir?
Well, it smells like this.
So, I'm gonna be bringing the first couple, the Schuylers, by at 9:00 a.m.
9:00 a.m.
Why not 6:00?
Oh, come on, Alex, please.
You promised.
So, we could be getting a lot of people here tomorrow, and if you could tidy up your studio.
it would be great.
It's such a wonderful room, but it looks smaller than it is with all the clutter.
Anyway-
- Clutter.
It's gonna be great.
Good.
Thanks, Lily.
- Can hardly wait.
- I'm the man.
Bye, Lily.
You could be nice to her.
She's done a lot of work for us.
She talks too much.
Well, I can't disagree with that.
This room has been my studio for more than 40 years.
What room will I be painting in next year?
Will it have a view?
Will it even have a window?
I think these could go over here, honey.
All right, here.
Here.
I'll take it.
I'll take it.
All right.
Oh.
You okay?
Okay.
I got it.
Ruth.
What?
We're making a mistake.
What do you want me to do, Alex?
I mean, it's already in the paper.
I just don't want Lily to railroad us like she did her mother.
That's because Sarah was sick.
Please.
Well, where will we go?
Oh, I see.
Well, with a million dollars, frankly, we could go anywhere.
We might get a million dollars.
Anyway, it'll cost a million dollars to get another place like this.
Not to mention the cost of moving and selling.
Then we'll go where the houses are cheaper.
No way we can leave New York.
We're not going to leave New York.
No, all we need is a place for you to paint and an elevator.
I handle the stairs better than Lily does.
Sure, you do now, honey.
But what about later?
Well, I don't know.
You know, I-
- I read about these open houses.
Uh-huh.
People steal things.
Okay, I will nail the furniture to the floor.
All right?
Don't like the idea of all those people in here.
poking through our things.
You do not have to be here.
You can take a walk.
You can go see a movie.
Well, I might do that.
We're just dipping our toes into the water.
That's all.
Nobody's making any commitments.
Nobody.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What happened?
What's wrong?
- Alex--.
Something's wrong with Dorothy.
What?
What's the matter?
She's shaking.
She's shaking, and then when I picked her up she screamed.
What's the matter, girl?
I think she's in pain.
Maybe we should, I don't know, take her to the vet.
It's probably nothing.
No?
Remember last year?
Cost us $700 to find out she had gas.
Don't try to go so fast.
You're gonna fall down these steps.
I'm not gonna fall down.
She's shaking because she's upset.
I think we could use an elevator.
Don't you, at this point?
I guess we could, but we don't have one.
- What happened?
- We think it's her back.
You want a cab?
Yeah, please.
Please.
Taxi.
Is there a fire?
They say that there is a gasoline truck stuck on the Williamsburg Bridge.
Always something, isn't it?
Thank you, Mr. Rahim.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Good luck with the dog.
The tanker is blocking two lanes.
Pop ] That's right, Brian.
All Manhattan-bound traffic is stuck right now--...
Are they talking about the bridge?
- ��.
Could you turn the music down, please?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
...has jackknifed on the Williamsburg Bridge.
A few minutes ago, the mayor made a statement urging people to avoid all but essential traveling--.
I still don't hear anything.
What?
What?
Did you forget your hearing aid?
Some tanker's stuck on the bridge.
That's all I'm hearing.
Now the mayor's telling people not to come into the city tonight.
Shouldn't we have taken the tunnel?
Nah.
No way.
Everything's a mess.
Hey, uh, what's with your dog?
Actually, we don't know.
Maybe he ate a plastic bag.
My dog did that once.
Yeah, he got real sick.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay, thank you.
There you go.
Keep the change.
Oh, God.
Here we go.
Good luck with the dog.
You'll find out in the morning if she ate a bag.
I got it, I got it.
You got it?
Okay.
You want me to carry her?
No, no, I've got her.
It's okay, sweetie.
We're almost there.
Okay, sweetie-
- Oh, my God.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I found her on the kitchen floor in her own urine, and when.
I picked her up, she screamed.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, Dorothy, let's see what's going on here.
It's highly probable it's a ruptured disk, but we'll need to do a CAT scan.
CAT scan?
Yeah.
- Is that expensive?
- Alex.
Alex.
I'm just asking, Ruth.
It's not cheap, Mr. Carver.
How much?
Uh, around $1,000.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah, okay.
We should do this right away.
Yeah.
Fine.
Good.
Okay.
Okay, Dorothy.
It's okay.
Okay, Dorothy.
Do you really think they can fix a ruptured disk?
Who knows.
We just have to be ready for the worst.
Don't s-
- Don't say that.
Please, Alex.
She's 10 years old.
I know.
But 10's not that old.
You're older than her in dog years.
Thanks.
The rupture is between T13 and L1.
It's about two-thirds down her spine.
Usually, this type of injury is best with, uh, surgery.
What if you can't fix it?
Well, animals adapt very well to new challenges.
I've seen dogs with paralysis live a full life with the use of wheels.
Wheels?
Yeah.
But look, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We'll keep her on the steroids.
And in the meantime.
you should go home.
We'll call you in the morning.
I wish we didn't have to leave her overnight.
Try not to put yourself in her place.
Animals adapt to their fates more easily than we do.
They don't remember what was.
Okay.
They deal with things as they are now.
Should we tell him how far we're willing to go?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
I mean, we have to be realistic, Ruth.
We can only spend so much.
And you heard what the doctor said.
Animals live in the now.
And it might not even be fair to Dorothy.
Uh-huh.
You might want to consider this.
Wait-
- What?
I'll call you tomorrow.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry, but what is that?
This is a DNR.
Do Not Resuscitate.
Wh-
- What are you t--.
Wait a min-
- Oh.
Ruth.
No.
Why did you sign that form?
We have to be practical, Ruth.
But it's not your decision to make.
We have to do everything we can for her.
And we will.
But what if there isn't anything we can do?
There's always something to do, Alex.
Just think it might be the kindest thing for her.
Yeah?
Let me ask you this.
Why do you always assume everything is gonna go wrong?
Because I plan for the worst and I hope for the best.
You think I don't know that after 40 years of marriage?
For Pete's sake.
We've had this same damn discussion for a thousand times.
Don't tell me that.
It's not a discussion.
This is an argument, Alex.
Argument, discussion, whatever you want to call it.
I'm doing what I think is right.
Okay, fine.
All right.
You do that.
But it doesn't matter, because I'm sure that Dorothy's gonna be fine.
Woman ] There has been no movement at this point.
The driver appears to be missing.
The NYPD, well, they're not saying very much, but--.
Woman #2 ] NYPD has released the identity of the suspect as Abdul Pamir.
We know who he is, but the real questions are--.
Where is he?
What is he up to?
And why did he run away?
Did you take your pill?
- Yes, love.
- Mm-hmm.
Man ] Thanks, Julie.
I've spoken with people who were on the bridge when the tanker jackknifed, and they said their immediate concern was that the crash--.
I'm going up to the roof.
Okay.
See what I'm saying?
Larry.
Stop.
Happy retirement.
Thanks for nothing.
Yeah.
Wishful thinking.
Oh, my God.
�� What are you doing, honey?
What is it?
Oh, God.
What is it gonna be?
Thank you very much.
I love you.
Uh-oh.
That feels a little--.
Wait.
There's something strange about this.
I don't know what's going on.
Oh, no.
It is.
It's trouble.
It's trouble.
It's trouble.
Aah.
This is the trouble.
Oh, you're adorable.
What are we gonna name her?
What do you think?
I got it.
I know what.
Dorothy.
Yeah.
Dorothy.
You're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.
Look.
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.
I love you.
I love you too.
I thought you were watching the news, honey.
Nothing 'new' about it.
It's all the same old stuff over and over.
I know.
But I think people feel safer when they hear things.
What do you think?
Well, they're kind of puny, but we got tomatoes.
How many did we get last year?
Six?
Seven?
Eight.
Eight?
Well, that works out to be about $9.00 apiece.
We could have gone to the Four Seasons for less than that.
I'm gonna go clean up.
Okay?
We can clean up tomorrow.
The people are coming tomorrow at 9:00, and Lily has given me a whole list of stuff that I have to do.
Nobody is going to be house hunting tomorrow.
We don't know that.
Would you buy an apartment this weekend?
You're as happy as you can be about all this bridge business.
aren't you?
Well, of course.
I planned this whole thing just so I could thwart Lily's open house tomorrow.
I wouldn't put it past you.
Oh, don't forget, you promised Lily you'd clean up your studio.
It looks like a mess, Alex.
Bomb detection unit is being brought on the scene with robots to check for such explosives in the tanker.
Now the bridge is swarming with NYPD.
Hello.
We have unconfirmed reports that there may be... some sort of explosive device--.
It's Lily.
So what about this bridge business?
Please, Aunt Ruth.
I closed on a loft in Tribeca the day after 9/11.
We might not get the usual hordes, but we'll get the serious ones, and that'll work in our favor.
I will see you tomorrow at 8:30.
Good.
Okay.
Thank you.
Woman ] Has identified the missing driver as Abdul Pamir.
Now we can show you a picture from Pamir's social networking site.
Isn't that a traditional Muslim hat he's wearing?
Yeah, Brian.
It's actually referred to as a kufi. Lily's coming by with the first couple at 8:30.
Man ]...of Pamir's.
Islamic faith.
Nothing stands in the way of real estate.
If you see something, say something.
Absolutely.
Vigilance is the--.
What did Lily call this?
Clutter.
Who'd have thought that the whole of my life's work would be worth less than the room I painted it in.
But how can I turn down a million dollars?
I have nothing else to leave Ruth besides all this clutter.
Oh, come on.
�� Okay.
Oh.
There.
Yes?
Yes?
Oh.
Hello, Doctor.
Yes, this is she.
Dorothy's stabilized, so I'd like to operate on her first thing in the morning to minimize distress.
Honey?
Yeah.
The doctor wants to operate on her tomorrow morning.
Yeah, now, she has a heart murmur, so I would-- Yes.
Yes.
I see.
Yes, of course.
He says the longer we wait, the more stress there is on her heart.
What are the odds if they operate?
What are her odds?
Around 60-40.
60-40.
In her favor?
In her favor?
No, there's no guarantees, but one can't be certain.
Oh.
Yes.
So, do you want to go ahead with this?
Well, yes, we do.
Um-- I-I should tell you the operation will be at least $10,000.
$10,000?
Yes.
Oh.
Well, that's a lot of money.
Let me talk to him.
Oh-
- Okay.
I'm sorry?
Uh, Doctor?
This is Mr. Carver.
Hello?
H-
- Hello?
What's the matter?
Doesn't work.
Hello?
Wait-
- Oh.
Is anyone there?
Doctor, this is Mr. Carver.
Yes.
Listen.
I want you to do whatever is necessary to save Dorothy.
Never mind what I signed.
The money doesn't matter.
Okay.
Just do whatever it takes.
Will do.
What?
You know what.
Aww.
Aww.
It's a brand-new day here at WZRZ, your place for New York talk.
Traffic is still snarled up on the Williamsburg Bridge.
We'll go out there with Cynthia Piermont soon.
But first, we have a studio full of newlyweds.
We're learning that the suspect, Abdul Pamir.
is from Uzbekistan.
Hey.
Hi.
Look at that.
What?
'Peril on the bridge.'
They make it sound like an amusement park ride or something.
Oh.
Several of Pamir's co-workers have come forward to say that he's a quiet, good-natured young man.
Who's screwing up the real estate market.
We're going now to Queens where the family is about to make a statement.
Logan is reporting live from the scene.
Abdul Pamir is a devout, gentle and caring son.
Yes, he was born in Uzbekistan, but he became a proud American citizen two years ago.
All we want is for him to come home safe.
Hello.
This is Dr. Kramer.
Mrs. Carver.
Oh, Dr. Kramer.
Uh-
- Honey, honey.
Hmm?
It's Dr. Kramer.
The good news is Dorothy made it through the surgery fine.
But when she was waking up, she had a seizure.
A wh-
- A seizure?
It concerns me.
You have to keep in mind she's not a puppy.
The anesthesia should wear off in the next couple of hours, and I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
Thank you, Doctor.
That's not good news.
Okay.
Turn off the TV.
Shit.
I-I don't want to see them.
Then go hide.
Good morning.
Hello.
Good morning.
These are the Schuylers.
This is Mrs. Carver.
Oh, please.
Call me Ruth.
Ruth, I'm Jenny.
It's good to see you.
Come on in.
Where's Dorothy?
Well, she's recovering from surgery and--.
Oh.
You know, you can have pets.
- We don't do pets.
So, do you see how the hallway expands the sense of space?
And look at the size of the kitchen.
You've got light coming from both directions.
You practically have to wear sunglasses when you have breakfast in here, it's so bright.
The master bedroom is this way.
'Master.'
Hello.
Yeah.
We're looking at some place.
Reminds me of my grandmother's.
I know.
Who's gonna buy a place with the shit that's going on out there now?
So this is the laundry room.
And this is a really large hall closet.
I love the plank floors.
I always hated the parquet floors in our East Side place.
Who came up with the idea of parquet anyway?
I don't know.
It's like walking on a board game.
I know.
This is the bathroom.
Only one?
I told you that, honey.
Jesus.
Yeah.
I'm listening.
The second bedroom.
- Sorry.
Uh, hello.
Oh, this is my husband's studio.
And I'm her husband in his studio.
How do you do?
Yeah, hold on a second.
Oh, isn't this an amazing view, honey?
Yeah, it's good.
It could be a nursery.
Or a screening room.
She's right, honey.
There'd be a lot of room in here once we got all this stuff out.
No, I told you we weren't doing that.
Does anybody listen to me?
My husband is in the financial sector.
Oh.
Was.
Is.
W-We've had a rough couple of years.
That's why we had to sell our duplex uptown.
I-It's all right.
'Cause our therapist says we need to lower our expectations.
She said i-it'll be healthy for us.
Good karma to live in a place like this.
Because we don't-- we don't really need all that much.
- I mean, who does?
Right?
- Right.
You could always go live in a cardboard box under the bridge.
This street is very sought-after.
Thank you for letting us see it first.
Oh, please.
My pleasure.
Shall I show you out?
Okay.
Thanks.
Bye.
All right.
Okay.
That was a good start.
Yeah, well, the others are gonna be better.
Couldn't be worse.
Honey.
So, there's good news and there's bad news.
Okay.
Um, they liked the apartment.
Oh.
Or at least she does, which is usually what matters.
They love the neighborhood.
Mm-hmm.
But they're a little worried about the stuff on the bridge.
It's gonna be over in a week.
That's what I told them, but they said if it happens once--.
Woman Speaking ].
What's happening?
...has now confirmed that there is no bomb in the tanker.
However, police have not yet ruled out the idea that the suspect may be armed.
Are they still saying this guy's a terrorist?
They don't really know.
If you see something, say something.
Today on this day, years after 9/11--.
Next couple.
Hi.
Come on up.
Does he have a device with him?
Is he wearing a suicide vest?
We, of course, have more questions than answers.
Great.
My God.
Nothing is being ruled out until they find the suspect.
Of course, we can't confirm if there is actually a bomb.
Then why keep talking about it?
- 'Cause they make shit up as they go along.
That's why.
Ah.
There they are.
Coming, coming, coming.
Okay, here we go.
Good news.
There is no bomb in the tanker.
They catch the driver?
No, not yet.
Mrs. Carver.
Oh, hi.
And what's the name of your dog?
Harold.
Can I pet Harold?
- No, no, no.
He's wearing the vest.
Sorry.
He's in training to be a seeing-eye dog.
He's still learning the difference between work and play.
Oh, Mrs. Carver, I'm Annie.
Annie Meyer.
Hello.
Well, yeah, we have a dog.
He's not here now.
No.
She's in the hospital.
She's recovering from surgery.
Hey, stop, Harold.
Heel.
Heel.
Heel.
Heel.
He must be smelling our dog.
Even so, he shouldn't be doing that.
Oh, he's young, Millicent.
Remember that next time he drags you under a truck.
No-
- Okay.
Isn't this an amazing kitchen?
Look at all the cabinet space.
the light.
When you have breakfast in here, you're gonna practically have to wear sunglasses.
Am I right?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Let's go to the living room.
It's right through here.
Don't touch the dog.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This is the living room.
Again, you see amazing light.
Oh, yes, it's beautiful.
And here is what I think is the--.
Oh.
Hello there.
Oh, no, no, no.
Harold.
No, Harold.
I'm so sorry.
- He's not fully trained yet.
Oh, wow.
What a great room.
Isn't it?
Thank you.
Harold, off.
Leave the paintings alone.
No, no, he's all right.
He might buy something.
Would you like to see the bedroom?
Okay.
It's through here.
Oh, that one is lovely.
Are you okay?
Ye-
- Oh.
Oops.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Oh, sorry.
Everybody's a critic.
What do you think?
I've seen better.
Are you interested in buying?
Me?
God, no.
I just like to look.
I go to all the open houses.
I'm writing a book about them.
A book.
There you go.
- Thanks for coming.
People are very interested.
Are you sure about that?
Yeah, I am.
Man ] The search for Abdul Pamir is still under way.
There have been a number of unconfirmed sightings and cell phone photos, but he's still out there somewhere.
More good news from the bridge though, Brian.
The tanker itself has been moved and all lanes reopened.
- Excuse me.
- Hmm?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Man, Woman Continue Speaking ].
Please don't do that, sweetheart.
You're gonna break it.
We don't say 'no' to Justin.
Well, I can say 'no' to him if you like.
We prefer to explain things to him.
Justin, do you know why it's inappropriate to flick the switch like that?
I don't give a shit.
Adorable.
Thank you.
Replace the French doors with glass.
The crown moldings have to go.
And see if the beams are decorative or actually structural.
Oh, can you tell me if the building association will let me see patients here?
- What kind of patients?
- I'm a psychotherapist.
You've come to the right place.
And, uh, this wall.
What does this wall do?
Hold up the ceiling maybe?
Thanks.
See if we can take down this bedroom wall, open it up a bit.
God knows it needs it.
Double-pane the windows.
Make sure they get rid of all this crap.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Yes?
The tub in the bathroom.
What's the deal with the tub?
Oh, well, my husband and I, we were at Brentfield and we saw this antique--.
Thanks.
Make sure that Roberto can take out the fixtures.
Put in all-new fixtures.
Man ] Likely get an update from the mayor's office later this afternoon.
This came off.
Oh.
Well... thanks.
Hope you're keeping an eye on things.
I guess.
I wish they would turn that TV off.
I told them twice already.
Maybe we should make popcorn.
I don't know about that.
Excuse me.
Did you paint the bathroom that color?
Uh, no.
We were out one night and someone broke in and painted the bathroom.
Is there a lot of crime in this neighborhood?
Did you notice that there's a window in the bathroom?
It's really particularly nice.
- Come take a look.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I think you should see about how Dorothy's doing.
No, no.
The doctor said he would call as soon as he knew anything.
Uh, excuse me.
Oh, yes?
Can I grow plants on the fire escape?
There's a roof.
Really?
And my husband grows plants up there.
Does he?
Good for him.
I grow mine for medicinal reasons.
Oh.
Oh, hi.
I hope you don't mind.
I have to lie down in a bedroom before I know what it's like to sleep in it.
This is the position I'm gonna be in the most in here, isn't it?
I suppose so.
- Oh, my God.
This is an awesome apartment.
We like it.
Would you mind turning off that light?
No.
No.
Thank you.
They make a lot of noise, don't they?
Well, not usually.
How long have you lived here?
40 years.
Wow.
40 years.
That's an awesome view.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, we like it.
- You looking to buy?
- My mother is.
And which one is she?
She's probably lying down on your bed right now.
Really?
She always does that.
But don't worry.
She won't buy it.
Oh?
We don't have any money.
Oh, I see.
Why are you selling it?
That's a good question.
- You have a dog?
- Yeah.
She's in the hospital right now.
What's happened?
She's just old.
What's your name?
Zoe.
Zoe?
Mm-hmm.
Pretty.
What's this?
This, Zoe--.
It's called a turntable, and it's used to play records.
These records are called LP's.
Stands for 'long-playing.'
The way it works is, you take this stylus--.
There's a little needle in there-- and very carefully place it on the record.
�� � Have I told you lately � � That I love you?
�... ...
- I like this song.
- So do I.
�� Who's this?
� Fill my heart with gladness � � Take away my sadness � That's my wife.
I like her glasses.
� Ease my troubles That's what you do ��.
They were all the rage back then.
How much does the school pay you to model?
Um, five dollars.
Well, 10 if it's more than three hours.
So take your time.
I could use the money.
I'm not going anywhere.
Not dressed like this anyway.
�� You a vet?
Yeah.
Vietnam?
I-I don't like to talk politics or religion in the studio.
Oh, my God.
In my family politics is a religion.
You ready?
Wait.
I-
- I wanna do something different with you first.
Should I call the cops?
How long have you had those glasses?
Oh, these?
I-
- I don't know.
Since I was a girl.
Here.
Put these on.
No.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, I won't be able to see through them.
Well, I'm the only person in the room who needs to see anything.
Yes, sir.
Take yours off.
Give them to me.
You're the first man I ever met who is more interested in getting my glasses off me than my clothes.
Give them to me.
Take 'em yourself.
Very cool.
That's the woman I want to paint.
Why did you pick me?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Out of the modeling pool.
Why did you choose me?
'Cause Camille is much prettier than I am.
Everybody picks her because, God, she's beautiful.
Beauty's not what I'm after.
Oh.
Well, that's a relief.
No.
I mean it's not the most important thing.
- So, what is?
- You're real.
Good answer.
Start painting.
You got three hours.
Thanks so much.
And again, my number is on the sheet if you have any questions.
Thank you.
Thanks.
That was worse than I thought it was going to be.
They ought to make it one of the 10 plagues.
First locusts, then house hunters.
So, the Dog Ladies are interested.
I'm going for air.
You need anything?
Yeah-
- No.
We're out of milk.
Milk.
What?
What'd you say?
The Dog Ladies are interested.
Okay.
So are the Matching Sweaters.
Both have asked for financials on the building.
But honestly, I don't think we're gonna get a real offer while that madman's on the streets.
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
It's later than I think.
Okay.
I'll be back in an hour.
We did good.
Right?
Did we?
I don't know.
We're with Debbie Hoffman, the 26-year-old bartender who spent several harrowing minutes last evening held hostage by suspected terrorist.
Abdul Pamir.
What exactly happened, Debbie?
I was about to take stock of the shop.
Then this guy comes in.
I tell him we don't open up for another hour, but he won't leave.
Did you see a bomb?
I don't know.
Could there have been a bomb under his jacket?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Then what happened?
- He goes up to the register and takes out all the money.
Nearly 200 bucks.
And I yell at him to put it back.
But he didn't.
- No.
He just mumbles something and runs right out the door.
What was he saying?
Who knows?
I don't speak Muslim.
Thank you, Debbie.
She thinks Muslim is a language.
Well, there you have it.
A harrowing experience--.
She ought to get a job with the diplomatic service.
Stay tuned.
We'll be right back-- It's Lily.
The Dog Ladies made an offer.
Really?
How much?
850.
850?
Well, so low?
It's an offer.
That's all.
Yeah-
- I don't know.
What do you think?
Should we take this?
What's the rush?
We've only been in the market 20 minutes.
Yeah, but I don't know.
If this guy blows himself up, we might not get a better offer.
Aunt Ruth has a point.
If this guy's a terrorist,
I say we wait until this blows over or he blows himself up.
Then the prices go back to where they were.
Okay.
It's your call.
Oh.
Wait.
I'm getting another call.
Uh, hello?
Don't you think we should think about it?
No, I don't.
No?
No.
Why not?
Because it's too low.
That was the Matching Sweaters offering to go as high as 875.
875?
But you have to decide now.
Because they don't want to get into a bidding war.
So the offer is only good for 15 minutes.
But what should we do?
I'm gonna call the Matching Sweaters and tell them about the Dog Ladies' offer.
And then I'm gonna call the Dog Ladies and just stall them.
This is getting confusing.
Relax.
This is what I do.
Mr. Hewitt?
Hi.
I'm going to call the doctor.
He's gonna say that things are exactly as they were when you called an hour ago.
Ruth, you have got to learn to stop worrying.
But I like to worry.
It keeps me calm.
Okay.
Good news, bad news.
The Dog Ladies texted.
They're thinking of dropping out.
Matching Sweaters said they need more time to discuss it.
What's the good news?
- A third party has made a bid.
Who?
- The woman with the blue leggings.
- Which one was that?
- The psychiatrist.
- Oh, her.
- How much is she offering?
885.
Okay, should we take it?
You may have a bidding war on your hands.
And once that starts, reason goes out the window.
I have had couples practically offer me their firstborn.
I am gonna call back Dog Ladies and Matching Sweaters, tell them about our new bid.
Then I'm gonna call Blue Leggings and tell her we are considering her offer.
Hi.
This is Lily Portman.
It's like we're talking about Indians in the Old West.
Blue Leggings and Lone Eagle.
Stop it.
Twin Sweaters and Running Trout.
Trout don't run.
Okay, I-- Hold on.
Did you get my message?
Yeah, but.
I don't want this-- I understand.
Uh, I will, uh, ask them.
You should pay attention.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay, we've got-
- Hold on.
Um, hello?
- Lily?
Hi.
Yes.
We'll go up to 886.
- 886.
- Yes.
I will let them know.
Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
Okay.
Here's where we stand.
Matching Sweaters has offered 886.
See?
You were right.
They're bid surfing.
They're trying to ride the crest of the big numbers.
But the first call I got was from the Dog Ladies.
What'd they say?
They wanna know what number you need in order to stop the bidding.
Well-
- No, no, no.
Tell them to make their best offer and we'll give it to whichever is highest.
- That's the way it works.
- Sounds good.
Lily Portman and Associates.
Please hold.
I'm gonna keep you posted.
If you go out, take your cell phones with you.
Lily Portman.
How can I help?
Yes.
I'm going to miss all of this.
Look at it.
Then why are we moving?
I don't--.
Okay.
Okay, here.
Okay.
Hello?
Yes, this is.
Dr. Kramer.
Dorothy's come around.
She's conscious and she's taking water.
That's-
- That's wonderful.
But we haven't seen any movement in her legs yet.
That doesn't sound good.
Does it?
When can we come and see her?
Maybe tomorrow?
It might be good for her.
Why don't you come by tomorrow morning.
Well, that would be wonderful.
Thank you very much, Doctor.
Okay.
Well-
- Well-- She's putting up a fight.
Yeah.
What would you expect from our little girl.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She must be frightened though.
Yeah.
She doesn't know where she is.
She doesn't know where she's going.
Like us.
Mm-hmm.
Like us.
May said they're gonna bring Jackson.
He's back from Hawaii.
Look at that.
God help us.
He's a nice boy.
He's not a boy.
He's a 49-year-old man living with his parents.
Off his parents.
All right, all right.
I know.
He's struggling.
Okay?
We're all struggling.
Honey, it might be a good time to talk to Larry about your paintings.
My clutter, you mean.
No.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I mean, when we move, we're going to have to do something about it.
Nobody wants that stuff.
Huh?
What?
Nobody wants-- No, you don't know that.
Yeah.
I'm gonna throw it away, I think.
They're your life's work.
Oh, my God.
You never change, do you?
I--.
Larry said that he landed at 7:00.
So as long as the traffic's not too bad, he will be there to meet you before he has dinner.
And this guy, he's-- he's very influential.
His reviews are, uh-- they're all over the place.
Where are you going?
Home.
What?
Get back here.
You're the artist.
Everyone is expecting you there.
No one gives a shit about my work.
I do.
'Cause you have to.
No.
I don't.
Believe me.
We're gonna get there, the place will be empty.
My work is tedious.
It's derivative.
That was one critic.
Oh, my God.
You're such a baby.
Is this what you're gonna be like every time you have a show?
No, because I won't have another show.
No one cares about my work.
Larry cares.
Only because he's my friend.
No.
He is showing it because he thinks he can make money selling it.
So you should stop whining and thank God that you have a friend like Larry.
Should thank May.
She's the one who bought him the gallery.
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe you should've married a rich girl yourself.
Maybe I should have.
But what'd I do instead?
I fell in love with some girl from Brooklyn.
Ah, geez.
You were right.
Empty.
Alex Carver, everybody.
Hi, Larry.
- Hi.
So anyway, tell me.
How's work going?
He's ghostwriting a book for someone.
Really?
Yeah, it's a self-help book.
How do you ghostwrite a self-help book?
That's what I said.
It pays.
And that's-- that's all I care about.
How did Dorothy's surgery go?
- Okay.
She's still not moving her legs.
Don't say that.
Oh, for crying out loud.
Mother.
You weren't this upset when Daddy was in the hospital.
Because she likes the dog more than she likes me.
Some days, that's for sure.
Oh, here we go.
Table's ready.
Come.
Come.
You should leave something.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
We had the open house this morning.
People came?
They came.
They came in droves.
Small droves.
Okay.
Small droves.
Should we tell them now?
- Sure.
Might as well.
Tell us what?
Uh-oh.
I'm making Jackson my new partner in the gallery.
Really?
Fishman and Son.
Partners.
That is terrific.
50-50.
Thank you.
Isn't that wonderful?
Yeah, it is.
Jackson will bring a more youthful take on things.
Anyway, we were talking today about your show.
Well, you-- you tell him.
We love your stuff, Alex.
Everyone does.
You've been successful now, what, 30, 35 years?
Hmm.
But--.
But right now your work is a hard sell.
I mean, uh, the market is skewing younger these days.
Portraits are not high on people's shopping lists.
They'll come back.
Sure.
But right now, they are not moving like they used to.
And the bottom line is you wanna sell your stuff.
Don't you?
- I'm sorry, Jackson.
I don't know.
Are we talking about selling art or selling stuff?
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.
No, because artists really don't paint to satisfy the market.
See what I mean?
Artists actually paint to satisfy themselves.
If you're going to run a gallery, you know, it's something you need to know.
Relax, Ruth.
No, I will.
Jackson's running a business.
- Exactly.
Exactly.
See, a gallery is a business.
I get what you're saying.
You're saying that Alex should paint what people want him to paint.
That's right.
That's right.
And then maybe when you have a prospective client lined up, you and Alex can go and you can visit the client's apartment, and you can see the room where they want to hang the painting.
And you can get some color samples of the wall paint.
Fun.
- No, that's not what I meant.
Jackson.
Jackson.
Ruth is pulling your leg.
- No, she's not.
- No.
I'm not.
I'm not.
You were hard on Jackson.
Well, he better get used to it if he's gonna work with artists.
He's just like Lily.
They just wants us to go away.
Okay.
Well, if they do, then it's up to us to let them know that we're not gonna go anywhere.
I don't wanna move to Florida and play shuffleboard.
Oh, my God.
Or live on some bullshit golf range a million miles from everything we know.
Nobody's gonna go live in Florida.
Then where are we gonna go?
We don't wanna wake up and find ourselves out on the street.
Oh, for God's sakes.
Nobody's gonna wake up on the streets.
Alex, why do you always have to be so melodramatic all the time?
I just don't like our lives being in the hands of somebody else.
Well, then fine.
Let's do something about it, all right?
Let's take things into our own hands.
How do we do that?
Look at us.
We've always done what we wanted to, haven't we?
Yeah.
Right?
We got married when it was still illegal in 30 states.
And people kept staring at us in the other 20.
Right?
So tell me, what's finding an apartment in comparison to that?
So let's just go get ourselves a newspaper and start looking.
What are you laughing at?
Why are you laughing at me?
You're reminding me of that girl with the glasses that I painted so long ago.
Yeah?
Yes.
Well, here she is, and I'll tell you one thing.
You're not gonna get my clothes off so easily this time, mister.
Wanna bet?
Oh, I've got it.
Okay.
All right.
Take this.
I got it.
I got it.
Oh, wait a minute now.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Where is--.
No, no.
Look at this.
No?
Where?
Here, here, here.
It says, uh--.
This one's on Franklin Street?
Mm-hmm.
'Cute'?
What's that mean?
That means it's small.
Oh.
So, wait a minute.
What about over here?
Oh, no.
Here's one.
Here's one.
Here's one.
Look at this one in Brooklyn.
It's in Brooklyn.
Uh, 'two bedrooms, lots of space and light.
Old-world charm.'
That sounds great, doesn't it?
That's our listing, Alex.
Oh.
Well, in that case, we should be able to get it cheap, right?
You think?
Yeah.
Why not?
Don't get smart.
�� �� ��.
What did Dad say?
Oh, you know your father.
- He's unsettled.
- He's unsettled?
Honey, he thinks you're too young.
I'm older than you were when you got married.
What about you?
What do you think about me marrying Alex?
I don't have an opinion.
Of course you do.
What is it?
I'm satisfied.
You're satisfied that I'm getting married?
What do you want?
I want you to be satisfied with that sundae that you're eating.
I want you to be satisfied with the soda that you're drinking.
But you're my mother, so I want you to be overjoyed that I'm marrying Alex.
At least, I want you to be happy for me.
- I'm trying.
- Try harder.
Mom is only trying to say that this marriage is gonna be difficult.
And what marriage isn't?
There's still so much prejudice, and--.
Oh, really, Sarah?
Thank you for telling me.
Think of your children.
Think of your children.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sweetheart.
You can tell Dad that he doesn't want to make me choose between my family and Alex, because if he does, you can tell him that my choice is already made.
�� � And foolish though it may seem � � Though it may seem � � To me � � To me �� This one sounds really nice.
Listen.
'Dazzling sun-filled corner two bedroom, built-in bookcases, window seat soaks up the morning sunshine.'
That's nice.
Yeah?
Where is it?
It's on 73rd and First.
Do we want to live in Manhattan?
Well, I think it would be a good change for us.
And we'd be close to Larry and May's place too.
And how much is it?
Well, it's a lot.
It's $1,100,000.
Okay.
We can't afford that.
Yes, but there's no harm in looking, honey.
No harm in looking.
Oh.
She recognizes us, honey.
Look at this.
Hello.
She hasn't walked yet, but she's obviously happy to see you.
Hey.
Of course she is.
Look at her.
She's bandaged up.
Can I touch her, Doctor?
Of course.
Hey.
Oh, yes.
You're so good.
You hang in there, kiddo.
You hang in there.
You hear me?
You're such a good girl.
Hang in there.
Good girl.
That-a-girl.
I know she's gonna walk.
I know it.
Of course she is.
She's a fighter, like you.
Like us.
So, what's a junior bedroom?
Does it have bunk beds?
Well, if it does, you get the top one.
Okay, honey?
No, this is it.
This is it.
You're kidding.
Yeah.
No, this is it.
It sure sounded better in the paper, didn't it?
We're wasting our time.
No, come on.
We're here.
Well, let's just look, okay?
Wait a second.
Which--.
Oh.
It buzzed.
I got in.
Okay, got it.
4C.
Oh, 4C?
Are you sure?
That's what the sign said.
Okay.
That's the-
- Okay.
Come on.
All right.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Let's see.
Oh, wow.
Don't even bother.
Um-
- Let me check this--.
It's you again.
Hmm.
I'm afraid so.
It's not as nice as your place.
It's not, is it?
Where's your mom?
Where do you think?
Lying down on the bed.
How's your dog doing?
She survived the operation, but still hasn't moved her hind legs.
She will.
You think so?
Yeah.
I know things like that.
I see.
I'm gonna go get my mom.
This time in a taxi.
We're going now to Logan Crawford, who is reporting from underneath the FDR with the abandoned taxi.
What's going on?
Pamir.
He hijacked a taxi.
When?
This morning.
Really?
Reporting underneath the FDR Drive.
The driver reported that Mr. Pamir seemed very nervous and he kept on asking, 'What are the police doing?
'.
He also asked about his family and seemed to be saying a prayer.
I think we should take the 885 that Blue Leggings is offering.
No, we don't want to rush into anything.
It's them.
Did you see, honey?
Yes.
They're not interested in our place anymore.
Now, you don't know that.
Yeah, well, they're here, aren't they?
They're just hedging their bets.
Wouldn't you?
Oh, please.
It's just making me so nervous.
So, you wanna see this place?
Not if it's as bad as the last one.
Well, don't be discouraged.
We're just looking.
Yes.
I didn't know how bad it could be.
It's in the neighborhood.
Remember?
You remember it.
It's the sunny two bedroom.
Oh.
Yes.
It's probably in a basement.
It's in the basement.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think this is it.
Oh.
This looks nice, and it's on the ninth floor.
We've never lived that high up before.
What's this?
Oh, I know what it is.
It said Vincent, right?
Here we go.
Yeah.
I think that's it.
There we go.
Oh.
Sorry.
Here's a flyer for you, if you want to take that with you.
Sure.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Oh, this is so much nicer.
Really.
Didn't I tell you?
Look at this entranceway.
I love this kind of an entranceway, honey.
And what about the light?
Yeah.
Very good.
It's not even that bright out today.
Honey, I'm gonna go find some water and take a pill.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Aah.
Piece of shit.
Here.
Oh.
Hey, you.
Why do they make it so hard to open?
Childproof.
Of course.
Do you like this place?
It's the best we've seen so far.
Put that back for me.
But it's still not as nice as yours.
Nothing is.
I hope you find a place you like.
So do I.
And when we do, I'm going to invite you to tea.
- How is that?
- Cool.
Oh.
Sorry.
Okay, I like this place.
I really do.
I really like it a lot.
Come here.
I want to show you something.
Just see this room.
Look at this, honey.
Look.
Oh.
Yes.
I'm going to talk to the agent.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm doing it.
Yeah.
I'm doing it.
Nowhere is going to have a view like our place.
But maybe Ruth and I have seen all the views we need to.
Maybe views are for younger people who still have things to look at.
Okay.
We'll look to hear from you guys this afternoon.
Thank you.
Oh, here she is.
Here she is.
Oh, hi.
Excuse me.
Actually, my husband and I are very interested.
Well, I don't have to tell you, this listing is getting a lot of heat.
Oh, yes.
We can see that.
Let me be frank with you.
Can you afford a place like this?
What do you mean?
I only ask because no one's gonna give you a 30-year mortgage.
We don't need a mortgage.
- Oh.
Well.
Then make an offer.
The owners are willing to consider anything.
But they're only accepting bids until 3:00.
That's two hours.
Mm-hmm.
Have your offer here by then.
They'll make their decision right away.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Oh, God.
Ma'am?
Yes?
A lot of people include a personal message with their offer.
What kind of personal message?
Something that persuades the seller to give it to you in case there's a tie.
Just don't be afraid to pull on the heartstrings.
Oh.
Right.
How do you like that one talking to us like we don't know anything?
I bet we've got more real money than all those young hotshots anyway.
But I just want to know.
What did you think of it?
I liked it.
Really?
Yeah.
Let's bid on it.
How-
- We haven't sold our own place yet.
Yeah, but we will.
We will.
We had a bunch of offers.
And you heard the real estate broker say that they're very willing to consider anything until 3:00.
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.
Any offer.
That's like until 3:00.
It's a beautiful apartment.
Yeah, it's all right.
It has a lot of light.
Yes.
It has light.
It has an elevator and more room.
New paint.
Honey?
Come on.
Let's do it.
Come on.
It sounds like something you really want.
In that case, we'll see another doctor.
What for?
He'll say the same thing the others did.
Maybe not.
Alex, you know he will.
It's the most natural thing in the world, and I can't even do it.
My mother.
My sisters.
They turn 'em out like machines.
one after another.
We don't need children.
No one needs children, Alex.
People want them.
I want them.
You want them.
Shit.
Shit.
God.
I am a goddamned failure.
You are not a failure.
I've disappointed you.
You've never disappointed me, Ruth.
I can see it in your face.
Stop saying that.
You have classrooms full of children.
Those are your kids.
That's not the same thing.
Then me.
I'm your kid.
You're always telling me what a big baby I am.
Well, you are.
You really like it, don't you?
I do.
And, honey, admit it, you do too.
I mean, I know-
- Wait a second.
I know it's not our place, but we're never gonna find another place like our place.
And we won't find anything better than this.
So, Alex, I mean, it's just--.
What is it?
It's a bid.
It's not a commitment.
It's, like-
- You know, we're not going to find-- They're never going to take it.
Trust me.
All right, fine.
Let's do it.
Really?
Yeah.
Should we call Lily?
No.
You said you thought we should do this ourselves, so I think we should, but we have to be smart.
What do you think we should offer?
Well, not so low that we have no chance.
I know.
But not so high that we start with something we can't afford.
So what would be the point of that?
Right?
I don't know.
This is what I think.
I think 900,000.
That's too low.
910.
You think?
I don't know.
Well, uh-
- You think?
910?
920.
No, 920.
No, but that's too much.
That's way too much.
Honey, do you want the place or not?
Yes.
I definitely want the place.
I want to be in the running.
So 920.
920.
No. 925.
It's more impressive.
Whoa.
Listen to you.
What?
You sound like you're some sort of an auctioneer.
Okay.
Do I hear 930?
Yeah.
Yeah, 930.
930?
That's a lot better.
I mean, so, what the heck?
It's just money.
Yeah.
This is hard to write when I don't know exactly what these people are like.
Tell 'em I'm senile and I want to live by the zoo.
Be serious.
Please.
How 'bout donating a park bench with their name on it?
Okay.
Ah, just tell them we love the place.
Breaking news.
The bartender.
Debbie Hoffman, who claimed that Pamir robbed her cash register, has now been charged with theft and misleading police after she admitted that she took the money. .
Yeah.
I knew there was something wrong with that.
Al-
- Alex?
Oh, my God.
Alex?
What?
- We got the apartment.
- What?
Already?
Yeah.
Isn't that wonderful?
Now, they want us to come over with the check right now.
Right now?
That's what they said.
I don't know.
You don't know what?
I mean, I think we should wait.
For what?
We don't wanna be giving our money to somebody with all this going on.
We're gonna lose this apartment.
That's what we're gonna do.
We're not gonna lose it.
What am I going to say to the real estate broker?
Just tell 'em we-- we-- we-- What?
Tell them we can't get there right now.
They're gonna take the next best offer, Alex.
No, they won't.
Yes, they are.
No, they won't.
Oh.
Wait.
Don't pick it up.
Don't-
- Don't-
- Don't-
- I just left a message on your cell.
The sellers are getting anxious.
If we don't hear from you soon, they're gonna open up the bidding again.
You heard what she said?
They're going to reopen the bidding.
She's bluffing.
She's not bluffing.
Right now we're the only ones that are bluffing.
Come on, honey.
We've gone this far.
We can't back down now.
The last thing we need, Ruth, is for somebody else to be pushing us into something.
Nobody is pushing us into anything.
Take things into our own hands.
That's what you said, honey.
I know what I said.
Will you please look at me?
All day yesterday, I heard you complain about being treated like garbage and ending up on the streets.
And then finally last night, we decide to make a move, but only if we have total control.
So, we look at a few places.
And then finally-- finally we get excited about one, we make an offer, and lo and behold, we get it.
We actually get the place.
And now you wanna back down?
Listen, if you wanna take control, this is how we take control, honey.
All I'm saying, Ruth, is this is a lot of money.
I know, but if we walk away from this, we'll just be acting like a couple of old fools.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hey.
Oh.
My God.
Everybody is so crazy out there.
I wish they would go ahead and find this guy already.
Jesus.
All right.
Here's where we are.
Blue Leggings is our last solid bid at 885.
But the Dog Ladies have called and they wanna come by in a few minutes with a counterbid.
Apparently, they wanna do it in person because they wanna make some kind of-- What's the matter?
Aunt Ruth, what happened?
Oh.
We--.
We saw a place this morning.
What do you mean you saw a place?
We went to an open house this morning.
and we loved it.
You went to an open house today?
If you knew you were ready to look--.
I don't understand.
Why didn't you call me first?
- Oh, what?
Wait.
We don't need to be asking you for permission.
No, I-I realize that, but I have listings too.
I have stacks of listings, and I have done a lot of work for you.
This isn't the easiest market.
Why didn't you call me first.
Aunt Ruth?
I'm sorry, Lily.
I really am sorry.
It wasn't her idea.
It was mine.
An apartment might not be the best idea for you right now.
There are other--
- Bullshit.
Wait a minute now.
We'll decide where we're gonna live.
Okay.
Okay.
Have it your way.
Where is it?
This place that you like so much?
It's in Manhattan.
Yeah, it's on 73rd and First.
It's just so beautiful.
- And how much is it?
- A million, one.
- A million, one.
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know.
We made an offer.
- I don't believe this.
- Well, they accepted it.
- What did you offer?
- 930.
And they took it?
Yes.
Yes.
That's not bad.
- Oh?
So we're not such fools after all, huh?
Okay.
Okay.
Uh, let's get real here for a minute.
So, nobody buys an apartment nowadays before they sell their own, especially not with what's going on out there.
- Who's the agent?
- I have the card.
Wait.
I know where it is.
I know I have it.
I know where it is.
Wait.
A woman, or-
- No, no.
Wait.
Wait.
Yeah?
Oh.
Okay.
Miriam.
Miriam.
Carswell?
Yes.
She's a shark.
What?
She's gonna eat you for breakfast.
What did she say?
They want the deposit.
Well, of course they do.
When?
Right now.
What did you tell 'em?
Well, we haven't called her back yet.
No, but wait a minute.
We want this apartment.
Well, then it is crucial that you sell this place fast.
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me a minute to think this through.
Um--.
I'm gonna-
- Yeah, I'm gonna call Miriam.
Okay.
Let me handle her.
Oh, God, she is upset.
I don't know why she couldn't talk to them in front of us.
I hope we haven't stepped on her toes.
I don't want them making deals behind our backs.
I didn't know the protocol.
We just saw an apartment we liked.
I don't-
- It's all right, baby.
She'll live.
Okay, here's where we stand.
I convinced Miriam that you're serious but that you have to rest.
I reminded her how old you are.
I reassured her that we would all be there by 5:00 with the deposit.
Okay.
Uh, what time is it though?
What time do we-
- It's 3:30.
And the Dog Ladies will be here any second, so-- Wait, wait, Lily.
Now, aren't we moving a little quickly here?
May I remind you that you're the ones who want to buy a new apartment.
This is how it works.
Dog eat dog.
- You snooze, you lose.
- Okay.
And one more thing.
I told Miriam that I'm the one who steered you to her listing.
So if she asks, back me up.
The least you can do is help me get a piece of the commission on it.
Well, sure.
I mean, obviously.
That's only fair, Lily.
Okay.
So, let me know as soon as you hear the Dog Ladies' offer.
And keep your fingers crossed that it's at least 950.
Because that's what we need to make this work.
9-5-0.
Otherwise, we're screwed.
Man.
She really does talk too much.
Authorities may be one step closer to catching the terror suspect.
Abdul Pamir.
Police have released security camera footage that appears to show Pamir looking over his shoulder-- and showing obvious concern.
Oh, God.
Doorbell.
I know it is.
Move it.
Move it, handsome.
Why, hello.
I hope you don't mind us just stopping by like this.
We were training Harold in the park.
We're here to make on offer.
Oh, well, please come in.
Would you like something to drink?
Anything.
Oh, no.
We don't want to intrude.
Just give them the bid, Annie.
So, this is as high as we can go.
- How is your dog doing?
- Mmm.
Well, it's actually kind of touch and go, so.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
Harold's actually not doing so well either.
No?
In school.
He has a learning disability.
We think.
Oh.
Wanna give her the-- Will they, uh-
- So this is our letter.
In case there's a tie.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh, Harold.
Sorry.
Harold.
Thank you.
You concentrate, now.
Do you hear me?
Don't open that letter till you've read their offer.
What?
I said don't open that letter till you read their offer.
Oh, no.
I won't.
Will you please open it?
Ho-ho.
Hello.
Hi, Lily.
Yep.
The offer is 950.
All right.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- That's good.
- 950?
Mm-hmm.
Fine.
That's good.
All right.
Bye.
- That is absolutely wonderful.
We can make this work.
Is Lily gonna call them and give them the good news?
She's gonna call the others first and see if they wanna make a counteroffer.
Yeah?
What?
No.
Tell 'em they can keep their lousy thousand dollars.
Hang on.
Hang on.
What?
Lily?
Lily, what happened?
The Matching Sweaters offered 951.
But here's the good news.
Dr. Gilbert's gonna e-mail you a counteroffer.
Okay.
But who is Dr. Gilbert?
Blue Leggings.
Oh, no.
Let me know what it is as soon as you get it.
We have to get over to the other place in half an hour.
Okay.
Thanks.
Bye.
Will you check the e-mail?
Yeah.
I know how to use the Internet.
Ooh.
'Dear Mr. and Mrs. Carver.
My partner and I moved to New York only a few years ago, and as you probably know better than most, it's not always been easy for us.
We've been trying to adopt for nearly six years, and it looks like we'll finally have a baby daughter, a little girl from India.
Your husband's studio would make such a wonderful room for her.
full of light and love.
Please consider letting us live in your wonderful home.'
Shit.
Honey, what?
Ruth, do this.
Um-
- No, let me get it.
Let me get it for you.
Honey, it's okay.
It's okay.
You do it.
You do it.
It's all right.
Got it.
Got it.
Got it.
Okay.
Well, Blue Leggings made an offer.
What is it?
960.
Nine-
- That's good.
Uh-
- I don't know.
Yeah.
What?
You're disappointed?
No.
It's just-- Honey, I read the Dog Ladies' letter, and I just think we should give them a chance to counteroffer.
Just-
- Ruth.
You heard that lady say this was their final offer.
See, I told you not to read that letter.
I know.
But they're adopting a little girl.
I-- These people are offering $10,000 more.
But do we really want someone like that living here?
Honey.
Do we?
I'm just asking.
Ruth, we're talking 10 grand.
All day we've been throwing numbers back and forth like they don't mean anything.
850.900.950.
Sugar, we're not rich.
We need to get a grip on reality here.
I know.
You're right.
It's just-- I wish we could give it to them.
I wish a lot of things.
I wish we could give our apartment to whoever needed it.
I wish we could give it to that lady on the bed and her little girl.
Most of all, I wish I could run up and down the damn stairs, like I used to, for the rest of my life.
Okay.
It's right there.
It's right here.
Where--.
I got it.
I got it.
Oh, here it is.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, Doctor.
What?
What?
Really?
What?
What?
What?
Really?
Oh.
- She walked.
- She walked?
- She walked?
- Yes.
Dorothy walked.
I knew she would.
High five.
Oh.
Yes.
Let me tell you.
What?
Once I give them this check--.
Yeah?
there's no turning back.
I know.
It's all-
- Everything is different.
Good different, honey.
Good different.
We'll see.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Now wait.
It's, uh-
- Okay, here it is.
Who is it?
Oh.
My husband and I are here with the deposit.
Hello?
Hello there.
You sure you got the right apartment?
I'm sure.
Yeah.
Hello?
We've come to buy the apartment.
Yes.
We're-
- Your broker.
We're meeting your broker.
She told us to meet her here.
I know who you are.
Your agent isn't here yet.
You can wait for her outside.
Oh, that's nice.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am going to call Lily.
No, no.
Here comes somebody.
'Cause that's rude.
Oh.
Oh, good.
Oh, God.
That was just--.
I'm calling Lily.
Lily.
Oh.
It's showtime.
Oh.
Okay.
I don't want to take it.
I want to wait.
We can't wait.
Who the hell is that?
That's their agent.
I said not later than 5:00.
I'm coming.
For Christ's sake.
Great.
They've been holding us hostage all afternoon.
Now they can't wait to get in.
Hi.
Hi.
How did you get in?
Uh-
- The-- Gentleman with a dog.
Oh.
So much for security.
Come on in.
Oh.
Thank you, I guess.
This is Mrs. Carver.
This is Mr. Carver.
I'm Lily Portman.
Hi.
How are you?
Oh, hi.
I'm Lily Portman.
How are you?
I need to talk to my wife.
This is Mrs. Carver.
Sure.
Uh, let's just go inside then.
Okay.
Great.
Thank you.
I don't want to take the offer.
We don't have to take it.
I'm telling you.
I know.
Fine.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's get down to business.
Hey, Miriam.
Hello.
So we, uh-
- We have the deposit check.
Great.
- What if we refuse it?
- Why would you refuse it?
Hold on.
- 'Cause maybe we want to open the bidding back up.
Why would you want to do that?
So we can get better offers.
These two have been holding us hostage all afternoon.
Nobody's been holding you hostage.
Okay.
All right.
Relax, everybody.
They're here now, and this is the best offer you've gotten.
Especially while all that shit drags on out there.
If you refuse my clients' check, it will be up to the courts to decide.
Your kid could be out of college by the time this thing is resolved.
Is that what you want?
Take his damn check.
Okay.
This way.
Do they even know what they're doing?
We know what we're doing.
Who do I make it out to?
Stephen Vincent.
Is that 'P-H' or a 'V'?
'P-H.'
Oh, something's happening.
Oh.
It's the terrorist thing.
What's happening?
It looks like they-they-- they found him or something.
Logan, what do you see?
Oh, my God.
...that the suspect in this terrorism plot, Abdul Pamir--.
In fact, there he is right now.
That's him.
He's coming out.
He has his hands over his head.
Wow.
He appears to be surrendering.
Now police are sending in a canine unit to sniff the suspect to see if there is actually a bomb or device.
Wait a second.
He seems very calm.
That might be a bomb there though.
The dog has walked off now.
That means there is likely no device, no bomb.
Get him off the streets for good.
Very, very good news indeed.
- That's his white flag.
Wow.
It's good they got him.
- Lock him up.
Now you can hear the choppers up ahead as well.
New York City's finest is doing their job, and they have got their man and they are about to-- Just shoot the son of a bitch.
Right in the balls.
Oh, come on.
Look at him.
Heck, he's-
- He's just a kid.
Well, what did you expect?
Well, I don't know.
A monster.
Anything but this.
What did he really do?
The little prick cost me 50 grand.
That's what he did.
Just leave it.
You need to let it go.
We can all rest easier now, knowing this terrorist is off our streets.
Isn't it a little bit too early to actually convict this young man?
He's just some poor guy.
Poor guy, my ass.
- I knew we should have waited.
You are the one that said to take the first decent offer we got.
I remind you, you are obligated to take my clients' offer.
Yes?
- Yes.
All right.
Just sign the thing already.
Just sign where indicated, Mr. Carver.
I'm not signing.
Alex-
- Are you all right?
What do you mean, you're not signing it?
I mean I'm not signing the damn thing.
When Ruth and I first moved to Brooklyn, it was like an outpost.
To our friends in Manhattan, we might as well have moved to Nebraska.
It was out of fashion, but a good place for a struggling artist like me.
And we liked it, which was good, because it was all we could afford.
Morning, Mr. Rahim.
Good morning, Mr. Carver.
Good morning, Dorothy.
So tomorrow's the big day.
You ready to move?
I don't know.
I would get out of here in a minute if I could.
Ah.
Where would you go?
Where would I go?
New York is the best city in the world.
Hello.
Hello.
Ruth.
It's like talking to someone in the wreck of the Titanic.
Ruth!
Ruth.
Ruth.
Uh...
What am I looking for in here?
The Times.
Oh.
Um...
I'm losing you.
Alex, stop moving around.
Are you near the door?
Listen to me.
Yeah.
It's in the rack.
Oh!
Mmm-hmm.
Lily's coming, so I got to go.
Yeah, she's here.
So I'll talk to you later.
You'll be fine.
Honestly.
Aunt Ruth, I don't know how you and Alex do it.
I'm 40-whatever.
And look at me.
Jesus, I got to join a gym.
Uh...
Excuse me.
Where is The Times?
Aunt Ruth.
Hide this.
We're gonna see a lot of action tomorrow.
Your mother gave that to me.
Well...
I wish she hadn't smoked so much.
I guess people don't really give ashtrays as gifts anymore, do they?
I don't know if people even make them anymore.
So the shades all have to be up.
Light is money.
Remember that.
How many people will come, do you think?
Who knows?
But what we want are the serious ones.
Oh.
You always get the lookers.
The people who just come to see how other people live.
It makes them feel better about their lives.
Or worse.
Who knows?
So when you're trying to sell, you don't want any clutter.
Uh-huh.
Less is more.
All the books gotta go away.
Chekhov.
The Lady with the Dog.
This was my favorite story to teach.
Uh-huh.
The girls loved it, but I remember the boys not so much.
Did you get Uncle Alex to change his mind?
Oh, he's still on the fence about it, but you know artists.
Too much practicality overwhelms them.
Ah, I'll get him there.
Because you're looking at maybe a million dollars.
Give or take.
Oh.
Two years ago, it would have been even more.
It was a feeding frenzy then.
The neighborhood's changed a lot.
It's cool now, filled with hipsters.
And gentrifiers.
Mothers with baby strollers that cost as much as a Chevy.
And their banker husbands, their heads buried in their smart phones.
Crossing the street while you're trading stocks and bonds doesn't seem that smart to me.
Hey!
Hey!
Watch where you're going.
The neighborhood's just got itself a Whole Foods.
All it needs now is the ultimate sign of modern civilization.
An Apple Store.
But as much as it's changing, I'm gonna miss this place.
Come on, Dorothy.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Come on, now.
Come on.
That's a good girl.
Good morning, Mr. Carver.
Oh, hi, Erica.
Are you all ready for the open house?
I guess so.
It's not the same market it was a few years ago, you know?
Well, we're just testing the waters.
What you're gonna want to do tomorrow, first thing, when you wake up...
Mmm-hmm.
...turn this on and let it simmer.
It gives the whole apartment a homey feel.
Okay.
It works every time.
Let's hope a lot of people are gonna love this apartment tomorrow.
This is a young people's building.
You know?
The stairs.
Come on.
I know you're tired.
So am I. Come on.
I know.
Come on.
Here, let me try.
I know how to put a key in the door.
Give it here.
I got it.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm carrying my bride across the threshold.
What bride?
We've been married two years.
You still like it?
Like it?
I love it.
Oh, look at all this light.
Hi.
I'm Alex Carver.
My wife and I, we just moved in.
Oh, hey, Alex.
Hey.
Hey, Dorothy.
Did you have a good walk, sweetie?
Big day tomorrow.
You all set?
Yes.
What is that smell?
Oh, that's cinnamon.
It gives the place a homey feel.
It smells like a whorehouse.
Is that a fact?
Yes.
And what does a whorehouse smell like, sir?
Well, it smells like this.
Uh-huh.
So, uh, I'm gonna be bringing the first couple, the Schuylers, by at 9:00 a.m.
9:00 a.m. Why not 6:00?
Oh, come on, Alex, please, you promised.
So we could be getting a lot of people here tomorrow, and if you could tidy up your studio, it would be great.
Because it's such a wonderful room, but it looks smaller than it is with all the clutter.
Anyway.
That's great.
So it's gonna be great.
Good.
Thanks, Lily.
I can hardly wait.
Bye, Lily.
You could be nice to her.
She's done a lot of work for us, honey.
She talks too much.
Well, I can't disagree with that.
This room has been my studio for more than 40 years.
What room will I be painting in next year?
Will it have a view?
Will it even have a window?
I think these could go over here, honey.
All right, here, here.
Here, I'll take it.
I'll take it.
All right.
Are you okay?
Okay.
I got it.
Ruth.
What?
We're making a mistake.
What do you want me to do, Alex?
I mean, it's already in the paper.
I just don't want Lily to railroad us like she did her mother.
That's because Sarah was sick, please.
Where would we go?
Oh, I think...
Well, with a million dollars, frankly, we could go anywhere.
We might get a million dollars.
Anyway, it'll cost a million dollars to get another place like this.
Not to mention the cost of moving and selling.
Well, then we'll go where the houses are cheaper.
There's no way we can leave New York.
We're not going to leave New York.
No.
All we need is a place for you to paint and an elevator.
I handle the stairs better than Lily does.
Sure, you do now, honey, but...
What about later?
I don't know.
You know, I...
I've read about these open houses.
Uh-huh.
People steal things.
Okay, I will nail the furniture to the floor.
All right?
I don't like the idea of all those people in here poking through our things.
You don't have to be here.
You do not have to be here.
You can take a walk.
You can go see a movie.
Well, I might do that.
We're just dipping our toes into the water.
That's all.
Nobody's making any commitments.
Nobody.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What happened?
What's wrong?
Alex.
Something's wrong with Dorothy.
What?
What's the matter?
She's shaking.
I don't know.
She's shaking, and then when I picked her up she screamed.
What's the matter, girl?
She screamed.
I don't know, I think she's in pain.
Maybe we should take her to the vet.
It's probably nothing.
No.
Remember last year?
It cost us $700 to find out she had gas.
Don't try to go so fast, Ruth.
You don't want to fall down these steps.
I'm not gonna fall down.
She's shaking, because she's upset.
I think we could use an elevator.
Don't you?
At this point?
Well, I guess we could, but we don't have one.
What happened?
We think it's her back.
You want a cab?
Yeah.
Please, please.
Taxi!
Oh, thank God.
Is there a fire?
They say that there's a gasoline truck stuck on the Williamsburg Bridge.
Always something, isn't it?
Thank you, Mr. Rahim.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Good luck with the dog.
The tanker is blocking two lanes.
That's right, Brian.
All Manhattan-bound traffic is stuck right now...
Are they talking about the bridge?
Could you turn the music down, please?
Yeah.
Please.
Thank you.
...has jackknifed on the Williamsburg Bridge a few minutes ago.
The mayor made a statement urging people to avoid all but essential...
I still don't hear anything.
What?
Did you forget your hearing aid?
Some tanker's stuck on the bridge.
That's all I'm hearing.
Now, the mayor's telling people not to come into the city tonight.
Should we have taken the tunnel?
Nah.
No way.
Everything's a mess.
Hey...
What's with your dog?
You know, actually, we don't know.
Maybe he ate a plastic bag.
You know, my dog did that once.
He got real sick.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay, thank you.
There you go.
Keep the change.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
Here we go.
Hey, good luck with the dog.
You'll find out in the morning if she ate a bag.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
You've got it?
Yeah.
Do you want me to carry her?
No, no, I've got her.
It's okay, sweetie.
We're almost there.
Okay, sweetie.
Oh, my God.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I found her on the kitchen floor in her own urine.
And then when I picked her up she screamed.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, Dorothy.
Let's see what's going on here.
It's highly probable it's a ruptured disk, but we'll need to do a CAT scan to know for sure.
Yeah.
CAT scan?
Is that expensive?
Alex.
Alex.
I'm just asking, Ruth.
It's not cheap, Mr. Carver.
How much?
Around $1,000.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah...
Okay.
We should do this right away.
Yeah.
All right.
Good.
Okay, Dorothy.
Okay.
Okay, Dorothy.
Do you really think they can fix a ruptured disk?
Who knows?
We just have to be ready for the worst.
Don't say that, please, Alex.
She's 10 years old, Ruth.
I know.
But 10 is not that old.
You're older than her in dog years.
Oh, thanks.
The rupture is between T-13 and L-1.
It's about two-thirds down her spine.
Okay.
Usually, this type of injury is best with surgery.
What if you can't fix it?
Well, animals adapt very well to new challenges, Mrs. Carver.
I've seen dogs with paralysis live a full life with the use of wheels.
Wheels?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, look, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We'll keep her on the steroids.
And in the meantime, you should go home.
And we'll call you in the morning.
Okay?
Okay.
I just wish we didn't have to leave her here overnight, you know?
Try not to put yourself in her place.
Animals adapt to their fates more easily than we do.
They don't remember what was.
Right?
I...
Okay.
They deal with things as they are now.
Should we tell him how far we're willing to go?
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
I mean, we have to be realistic, Ruth.
We can only spend so much.
And you heard what the doctor said.
Animals live in the now.
And it might not even be fair to Dorothy.
You might want to consider this.
Wait.
What?
I'll call you tomorrow.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry, but what is that?
This is a DNR.
Do Not Resuscitate.
What are you talking...
Wait a minute.
Oh!
Ruth.
No.
Why did you sign that form?
We have to be practical, Ruth.
But, Alex, it's not your decision to make.
We have to do everything we can for her.
And we will.
But what if there isn't anything we can do?
There's always something to do, Alex.
I just think it might be the kindest thing for her.
Yeah.
Why do you always assume...
Just let me ask you this.
Why do you always assume everything is gonna go wrong?
Because I plan for the worst and I hope for the best.
Oh, you think I don't know that after 40 years of marriage?
Insane.
We've had this same damn discussion for a thousand times.
It's not a discussion.
Don't tell me that.
It's not a discussion.
This is an argument, Alex.
All right.
Argument, discussion, whatever you want to call it.
I'm just doing what I think is right.
Okay, fine.
All right.
Fine, you do that.
But I'll tell you right now, it doesn't really matter, because I'm sure that Dorothy's gonna be fine.
There has been no movement at this point.
The driver appears to be missing.
The NYPD, well, they're not saying very much, but...
NYPD has released the identity of the suspect as Abdul Pamir.
We know who he is, but the real questions are, where is he?
What is he up to?
And why did he run away?
Did you take your pill?
Yes, love.
Mmm-hmm.
- Thanks, Julie.
I've already spoken with some of the people who were on the bridge when the tanker jackknifed.
And they said their immediate concern was...
I'm going up to the roof.
Okay.
Do you see what I'm seeing?
Larry, no!
Happy retirement.
Thanks for nothing.
Yeah.
Wishful thinking.
Oh, my God!
This is embarrassing.
What are you doing, honey?
What is it?
Oh, God.
What is it going to be?
Thank you very much.
I love you.
Uh-oh.
That feels a little...
Wait.
There's something strange about this.
Something doesn't...
I don't know what's going on.
Oh, no, it is!
It's trouble!
It's trouble!
It's trouble!
- Aw!
This is the trouble.
Oh, you're adorable.
What are we gonna name her?
What do you think?
I got it.
I know what.
Dorothy.
Yeah.
Dorothy.
You're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.
Look.
Oh, my God.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
I thought you were watching the news, honey.
Nothing new about it.
It's all the same old stuff over and over.
I know.
But I think people feel safer when they hear things.
Look at these.
What do you think?
Well, they're kind of puny, but we got tomatoes.
How many did we get last year?
Six?
Seven?
Eight.
Eight?
That works out to be about nine dollars apiece.
We could have gone to the Four Seasons for less than that.
I'm gonna go clean up.
Okay?
We can clean up tomorrow.
The people are coming tomorrow at 9:00, and Lily has given me a whole list of stuff that I have to do.
Nobody is going to be house hunting tomorrow.
We don't know that.
Would you buy an apartment this weekend?
You know, you're just as happy as you can be about all this bridge business, aren't you?
Well, of course, I planned this whole thing, so I could thwart Lily's open house tomorrow.
I wouldn't put it past you.
And, oh...
Don't forget you promised Lily you'd clean up your studio.
It looks like a mess, Alex.
Bomb detection unit is being brought on the scene with robots to check for such explosives in the tanker.
Now the bridge is swarming with NYPD.
We have unconfirmed reports that there may be some sort of explosive device in the gasoline tank.
So what about this bridge business, anyway?
Please, Aunt Ruth, I sold a loft in Tribeca the day after 9/11.
We might not get the usual hordes, but we'll get the serious ones and that'll work in our favor.
I will see you tomorrow at 8:30.
Good, okay, thank you.
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:... missing driver as Abdul Pamir.
Now, we can show you a picture from Pamir's social networking site.
Isn't that a traditional Muslim hat he's wearing?
Yeah, Brian.
It's actually referred to as a kufi...
Oh, Lily's coming by with the first couple at 8:30.
Nothing stands in the way of real estate.
What did Lily call this?
Clutter.
Who'd have thought that the whole of my life's work would be worth less than the room I painted it in.
But how can I turn down a million dollars?
I have nothing else to leave Ruth besides all this clutter.
Oh...
Come on.
Okay.
Oh!
There.
Yes?
Oh, hello, Doctor.
Yes, this is she.
Dorothy's stabilized, so I'd like to operate on her first thing in the morning to minimize distress.
Honey?
Yeah.
The Doctor wants to operate on her tomorrow morning.
Yeah, now, she has a heart murmur.
Yes.
Yes.
I see.
Yes, of course.
He says the longer we wait the more stress there is on her heart.
What are the odds if they operate?
What are her odds?
Around 60-40.
60-40?
In her favor?
There's no guarantees, but one can't be certain.
Oh.
So do you want to go ahead with this?
Well, yes, we do.
I should tell you that the operation will be at least $10,000.
$10,000?
Yes.
Oh, well, that's a lot of money.
I don't really know...
Here.
Let me talk to him.
Oh.
Okay.
Doctor?
This is Mr. Carver.
Hello?
Hello?
What's the matter?
Doesn't work.
Hello?
What?
Oh!
Oh.
Is anyone there?
Doctor, this is Mr. Carver.
Yes.
Listen.
I want you to do whatever is necessary to save Dorothy.
Never mind what I signed.
The money doesn't matter.
Okay.
Just do whatever it takes.
Will do.
What?
You know what.
It's a brand new day here at WZRZ.
Your place for New York talk.
Traffic is still snarled up on the Williamsburg Bridge.
We'll go out there with Cynthia Piermont soon.
But first, we have a studio full of newlyweds.
So we're learning now that the suspect, police source said,
Abdul Pamir is from Uzbekistan.
Hey.
Look at that.
What?
"Peril on the bridge!"
They make it sound like an amusement park ride or something.
Oh!
Several of Pamir's co-workers have come forward to say that he's a quiet, good-natured young man.
Who's screwing up the real estate market.
We're going now to Queens, where the family is about to make a statement.
Logan is reporting live from the scene.
Abdul Pamir is a devout, gentle and caring son.
Yes, he was born in Uzbekistan, but he became a proud American citizen two years ago.
All we want is for him to come home safe.
Hello.
This is Dr. Kramer, Mrs. Carver.
Oh, Dr. Kramer.
Uh...
Honey, honey.
It's Dr. Kramer.
The good news is Dorothy made it through the surgery fine.
But when she was waking up, she had a seizure.
A seizure?
It concerns me.
You have to keep in mind she's not a puppy.
Now, the anesthesia should wear off in the next couple of hours.
And I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
All right?
Thank you, Doctor.
Hey...
I mean, that's not good news.
Oh.
Okay.
Turn off the TV, honey.
Okay.
I don't want to see them.
Then go hide.
Good morning!
Hello.
Good morning.
These are the Schuylers.
This is Mrs. Carver.
Oh, please.
Call me Ruth.
Ruth.
I'm Jenny.
Well, good.
It's good to see you.
Come on in.
Where's Dorothy?
Well, she's recovering from surgery and...
Well, you know, you can have pets.
We don't do pets.
So do you see how the hallway expands the sense of space?
And would you look at the size of the kitchen.
You've got light coming from both directions.
You practically have to wear sunglasses when you have breakfast in here.
It's so bright.
So the master bedroom is this way.
Master.
Hello.
Yeah.
Oh, we're looking at some place.
Reminds me of my grandmother's.
I know.
Who's gonna buy a place with the shit that's going on out there now?
So this is the laundry room.
Right.
And this is a really large hall closet.
I love the plank floors.
I always hated the parquet floors in our East Side place.
Uh-huh.
Who came up with the idea of parquet, anyway?
I don't know.
It's like walking on a board game.
I know.
This is the bathroom.
Only one?
I told you that, honey.
Jesus.
Yeah.
I'm listening.
The second bedroom.
Sorry.
Oh, hello.
Oh, this is my husband's studio.
And I'm her husband in his studio.
How do you do?
Yeah, hold on a second.
Oh, isn't this an amazing view, honey?
Yeah, it's good.
It could be a nursery.
Or a screening room.
She's right, honey.
There'd be a lot of room in here once we got all this stuff out.
No, I told you we weren't doing that.
Does anybody listen to me?
My husband is in the financial sector.
Oh.
Was.
Is.
We've had a rough couple of years.
That's why we had to sell our duplex uptown.
It's all right.
'Cause our therapist says we need to lower our expectations.
She said it'll be healthy for us.
It'd be good karma to live in a place like this.
Because we don't really need all that much.
I mean, who does, right?
Right.
You could always go live in a cardboard box under the bridge.
This street is very sought after.
Thank you for letting us see it first.
Please.
My pleasure.
Shall I show you out?
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
That was a good start.
Yeah, well, the others are gonna be better.
Couldn't be worse.
Stop.
Honey.
So there's good news, and there's bad news.
Okay.
Um...
They liked the apartment, or at least she does...
Ooh!
...which is usually what matters.
They love the neighborhood...
Mmm-hmm.
...but they're a little worried about the stuff on the bridge.
No.
But it's gonna be over in a week.
Yeah.
That's what I told them, but they said if it happens once...
What's happening?
NEWS ANCHOR:... that there is no bomb in the tanker.
However, police have not yet ruled out the idea that the suspect may be armed.
Are they still saying this guy is a terrorist?
They don't really know.
If you see something, say something today on this day, years after 9/11.
Ah!
Next couple.
Hi.
Come on up.
Does he have a device with him?
Is he wearing a suicide vest?
We, of course, have more questions than answers.
Great.
My God.
It is true, though, Brian, that nothing is being ruled out until they find the suspect.
Of course, we can't confirm if there is actually a bomb.
Then why do you keep talking about it?
'Cause they make shit up as they go along.
That's why.
Oh!
Okay.
Okay.
Coming, coming, coming.
Okay.
Here we go.
Good news.
There is no bomb in the tanker.
Did they catch the driver?
No, not yet.
Mrs. Carver?
Yes.
And what's the name of your dog?
This is Harold.
Can I pet Harold?
No.
No, no!
He's wearing a vest.
Sorry.
He's in training to be a seeing eye dog.
He's still learning the difference between work and play.
Oh, Mrs. Carver, I'm Annie.
Annie Meyer.
Hello.
Well, you know, we have a dog.
He's not here now.
Well, no.
She's in the hospital.
She's recovering from surgery.
Oh, n...
Oh!
Whoa!
Harold, Harold!
Stop, Harold.
Heel!
Heel!
He must be smelling our dog.
Even so, he shouldn't be doing that.
Oh, he's young, Millicent.
Remember that next time he drags you under a truck.
Harold.
No!
Okay.
Isn't this an amazing kitchen?
I mean, look at all the cabinet space, the light.
When you have breakfast in here, you're gonna practically have to wear sunglasses.
Am I right?
Maybe.
I don't know.
So let's go to the...
The living room is right through here.
Can I?
Sure, sure.
Oh, my God.
Don't touch the dog.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This is the living room.
Again, you see amazing light.
Oh, yes, it's beautiful.
And here is what I think is the...
Oh, Hello, there.
No, no, Harold.
No, Harold.
I'm so sorry.
He's not fully trained yet, so...
Oh, wow, what a great room.
Isn't it?
Thank you.
Harold, Harold, off.
Leave the paintings alone.
Oh, no, it's all right.
He might buy something.
Would you like to see the bedroom?
Okay.
Yes.
It's just through here.
Oh, that one is lovely.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Oh!
Sorry.
Oh, sorry.
Everybody's a critic.
Well, what do you think?
Oh, I've seen better.
Yeah.
Are you interested in buying?
Me?
God, no.
I just like to look.
I go to all the open houses.
I'm writing a book about them.
A book.
There you go.
Thanks for coming.
People are very interested.
Are you sure about that?
Yeah, yeah.
The search for Abdul Pamir is still underway.
There have been a number of unconfirmed sightings and cell phone photos, but he's still out there somewhere.
More good news from the bridge, though, Brian.
The tanker itself has been moved and all lanes reopened.
Excuse me.
Hmm?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh, please don't do that, sweetheart.
You're gonna break it.
We don't say "no" to Justin.
Well, I can say "no" to him, if you like.
We prefer to explain things to him.
Justin, do you know why it's inappropriate to flick the switch like that?
I don't give a shit.
Adorable.
Thank you.
Replace the French doors with glass.
The crown moldings have to go.
And see if the beams are decorative or actually structural.
Oh, can you tell me if the building association will let me see patients here?
What kind of patients?
I'm a psychotherapist.
You've come to the right place.
And this wall.
What does this wall do?
Hold up the ceiling maybe?
Thanks.
See if we can take down this bedroom wall.
Open it up a bit.
God knows it needs it.
Double pane the windows.
Make sure they get rid of all this crap.
Excuse me.
Oh, yes.
The tub in the bathroom.
What's the deal with the tub?
Oh, well, my husband and I were at Brentfield and we saw this antique...
Thanks.
Make sure that Roberto can take out the fixtures...
This came off.
Oh, well...
Thanks.
I hope you're keeping an eye on things.
I guess.
I wish they would turn the TV off.
Oh, I know.
I told them twice already.
I can't...
Maybe we should make popcorn.
Oh, no.
Not that.
Excuse me.
Did you paint the bathroom that color?
No.
We were out one night and someone broke in and painted the bathroom.
Is there a lot of crime in this neighborhood?
Did you notice that there's a window in the bathroom?
It's really particularly nice.
Come take a look.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I think we should see about how Dorothy's doing.
No, no.
Yes.
The doctor said he would call as soon as he knew anything.
He did.
He...
Oh.
Excuse me.
Oh, yes.
Can I grow plants on the fire escape?
There's a roof.
Really?
Yeah.
And my husband grows plants up there.
Does he?
Yes.
Good for him.
I grow mine for medicinal reasons.
Oh.
Oh, hi.
I hope you don't mind.
I have to lie down in a bedroom before I know what it's like to sleep in it.
I mean, this is the position I'm gonna be in the most in here, isn't it?
I suppose so.
Oh, my God.
This is an awesome apartment.
We like it.
Would you mind just turning off that light?
No.
No.
Thank you.
They make a lot of noise, don't they?
Well, not usually.
How long have you lived here?
40 years.
Wow.
40 years.
That's an awesome view.
Uh...
Yeah.
Yeah, we like it.
You looking to buy?
My mother is.
And which one is she?
She's probably lying down on your bed right now.
Really?
She always does that.
But don't worry.
She won't buy it.
Oh?
We don't have any money.
Oh, I see.
Why are you selling it?
That's a good question.
You have a dog?
Yeah.
She's in the hospital right now.
What's happened?
She's just old.
What's your name?
Zoe.
Zoe?
Mmm-hmm.
Pretty.
What's this?
This, Zoe, is called a turntable.
And it's used to play records.
These records are called LPs.
Stands for long-playing.
The way it works is you take this stylus, there's a little needle in there, and very carefully place it on the record.
I like this song.
So do I.
Who's this?
That's my wife.
I like her glasses.
They were all the rage back then.
How much does the school pay you to model?
Um...
Five dollars.
Well, 10, if it's more than three hours.
So take your time.
I could use the money.
I'm not going anywhere.
Not dressed like this, anyway.
You a vet?
Yeah.
Vietnam?
I don't like to talk politics or religion in the studio.
Oh, my God.
In my family, politics is a religion.
You ready?
Wait.
I wanna do something different with you first.
Should I call the cops?
How long have you had those glasses?
Oh, these?
I don't know.
Since I was a girl.
Here.
Put these on.
No.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, I won't be able to see through them.
Well, I'm the only person in the room who needs to see anything.
Yes, sir.
Take yours off.
Give them to me.
You're the first man I ever met who is more interested in getting my glasses off me than my clothes.
Give them to me.
Take them yourself.
Very cool.
That's the woman I wanna paint.
Why did you pick me?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Out of the modeling pool.
Like, why did you choose me?
'Cause Camille is much prettier than I am.
Everybody picks her, because, God, she's beautiful!
Beauty's not what I'm after.
Oh!
Well, that's a relief.
No, I mean, it's not the most important thing.
So what is?
You're real.
Good answer.
Start painting.
You got three hours.
Thanks so much.
And, again, my number is on the sheet, if you have any questions.
Thank you.
Thanks.
That was worse than I thought it was going to be.
You ought to make it one of the 10 plagues.
First, locusts, then house hunters.
Okay, so the dog ladies are interested.
I'm going for air.
You need anything?
Yeah!
No, we're out of milk.
Milk.
What?
What did you say?
The dog ladies are interested.
Okay.
So are the matching sweaters.
Both have asked for financials on the building.
But, honestly, I don't think we're going to get a real offer, while that madman's on the streets, you know?
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
It's later than I think.
Okay.
I'll be back in an hour.
We did good!
Right?
Did we?
I don't know.
We're with Debbie Hoffman, the 26-year-old bartender who spent several harrowing minutes last evening held hostage by suspected terrorist Abdul Pamir.
What exactly happened, Debbie?
I was about to take stock of the shop, and then this guy comes in.
And I tell him we don't open up for another hour, but he won't leave.
Did you see a bomb?
I don't know.
Could there have been a bomb under his jacket?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe.
Then what happened?
He looks pretty scared.
And he goes up to the register and he takes out all the money.
Nearly 200 bucks.
And I yell at him to put it back.
But he didn't.
No.
He just mumbles something and he runs right out the door.
What was he saying?
You know, who knows?
I don't speak Muslim.
Thank you, Debbie.
She thinks Muslim is a language.
Well, there you have it.
A harrowing experience.
She ought to get a job with the Diplomatic Service.
Stay tuned.
We'll be right back...
It's Lily!
The dog ladies made an offer!
Really?
How much?
850.
850?
Well...
So low?
It's an offer.
That's all.
Yeah.
I don't know.
What do you think?
Should we take this?
What's the rush?
What's the rush?
We've only been in the market 20 minutes.
Yeah, but I don't know.
I mean, if this guy blows himself up, we might not get a better offer.
Aunt Ruth has a point.
If this guy's a terrorist, I say we wait until this blows over or he blows himself up.
And then the prices go back to where they were.
Okay.
Whatever you want.
It's your call.
Oh, wait!
I'm getting another call!
Hello.
Don't you think we should think about it?
No, I don't.
No?
No.
Why not?
Because it's too low.
Okay.
That was the matching sweaters and they're offering to go as high as 875.
875?
But you have to decide now, because they don't want to get into a bidding war.
So the offer is only good for 15 minutes.
But what should we do?
So I'm gonna call the matching sweaters, and tell them about the dog ladies' offer.
And then I'm gonna call the dog ladies and just stall them.
This is getting confusing.
Relax!
This is what I do.
Mr. Hewitt?
I'm going to call the doctor.
He's gonna say that things are exactly as they were when you called an hour ago.
Ruth, you have got to learn to stop worrying.
But I like to worry.
It keeps me calm.
Good news, bad news.
The dog ladies texted, they're thinking of dropping out.
Matching Sweaters said they need more time to discuss it.
What's the good news?
A third party has made a bid.
Who?
The woman with the blue leggings.
Okay, which one was that?
The psychiatrist.
Oh, her.
How much is she offering?
885.
Okay.
Should we take it?
You may have a bidding war on your hands.
And once that starts, reason goes out the window.
I have had couples practically offer me their firstborn.
I am gonna call back Dog Ladies and Matching Sweaters, tell them about our new bid.
Then I'm gonna call Blue Leggings and tell her we are considering her offer.
Oh, God.
- Hi...
What?
It's like we're talking about Indians in the Old West.
Blue Leggings and Lone Eagle.
Stop it.
Twin Sweaters and Running Trout.
Stop it.
Trout don't run.
Okay!
Hold on.
Did you get my message?
Yeah, but here's the thing.
I don't...
I understand.
I will, uh, ask them.
You should pay attention to her.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay!
We've got a...
Hold on.
Um, hello?
Lily?
Hi.
We'll go up to 886.
Yes.
886.
I will let them know.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
Okay!
Here's where we stand.
Matching Sweaters has offered 886.
See?
You were right.
They're bid surfing.
They're trying to ride the crest of the big numbers.
But the first call I got was from the dog ladies.
What'd they say?
They wanna know what number you need in order to stop the bidding.
Well...
No, no, no.
Tell them to make their best offer, and we'll give it to whichever is highest.
That's the way it works.
Sounds good.
Ah!
Lily Portman and Associates, please hold.
I'm gonna keep you posted.
If you go out, you take your cell phones with you.
Lily Portman.
How can I help?
Yes.
I'm going to miss all of this.
Look at it.
Then why are we moving?
I don't...
Okay.
Wait.
Hello?
Yes, this is Dr. Kramer.
Dorothy's come around.
She's conscious and she's taking water.
Yeah.
That's wonderful.
But we haven't seen any movement in her legs yet.
That doesn't sound good.
Does it?
Look...
When can we come and see her?
Maybe tomorrow?
It might be good for her.
Why don't you come by tomorrow morning?
Well, that would be wonderful.
Thank you very much, Doctor.
Well?
Well.
She's putting up a fight.
Yeah.
What would you expect from our little girl, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She must be frightened though.
Yeah.
She doesn't know where she is.
She doesn't know where she's going.
Like us.
Mmm-hmm.
Like us.
May said they're gonna bring Jackson.
He's back from Hawaii.
Look at that.
God help us.
He's a nice boy.
He's not a boy.
He's a 49-year-old man living with his parents.
Off his parents.
All right, all right.
I know.
He's struggling, okay?
We're all struggling.
Honey, it might be a good time for you to talk to Larry about your paintings.
My clutter, you mean.
No.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I mean, when we move, we're going to have to do something about it.
Nobody wants that stuff.
Huh?
What?
Nobody wants...
No, you don't know that.
I'm going to throw it away, I think.
They're your life's work.
Oh, my God.
You never change, do you?
Larry said that he landed at 7:00.
So as long as the traffic's not too bad, then he will be there to meet you before he has dinner.
And, this guy, I mean.
He's very influential.
His reviews are...
They're all over the place.
Where are you going?
Home.
What?
Get back here!
You're the artist.
Everyone is expecting you there.
No one gives a shit about my work.
I do.
'Cause you have to.
No.
I don't.
Believe me.
We're gonna get there, the place will be empty.
My work is tedious.
It's derivative.
That was one critic.
Oh, my God.
You're such a baby.
I mean, is this what you're gonna be like every time you have a show?
No, because I won't have another show.
No one cares about my work.
Larry cares.
Only because he's my friend.
No.
He is showing up because he thinks he can make money selling it.
So you should stop whining, and just thank God that you have a friend like Larry.
Should thank May.
She's the one who bought him the gallery.
Oh, yeah?
Maybe you should have married a rich girl yourself.
Maybe I should have.
What did I do instead?
I fell in love with some girl from Brooklyn.
Ah, jeez.
You were right.
Empty.
Alex Carver, everybody!
Hi, Larry!
Thank you, Larry.
Hi.
So, anyway, tell us, how's work going?
He's ghost writing a book for someone.
Really?
Yeah.
It's a self-help book.
How do you ghost write a self-help book?
That's what I said!
It pays.
And that's all I care about.
Okay.
Right?
How did Dorothy's surgery go?
Okay.
Well, she's still not moving her legs.
I don't know what to say.
Oh, don't say that!
Oh, for crying out loud.
Mother!
For crying out loud what?
Mother...
You weren't this upset when Daddy was in the hospital.
Well, because she likes the dog more than she likes me.
Some days that's for sure.
Oh, here we go.
Table's ready.
Come, come.
You should leave something.
Oh, I forgot to tell you!
I'll take care of it.
It's on the bill.
We had the open house this morning.
People came?
They came.
They came in droves.
Small droves.
Okay.
Small droves.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
- Should we tell them now?
- Sure.
Why not?
- Yeah.
Might as well.
Tell us what?
Oh.
Uh-oh.
I'm making Jackson my new partner in the gallery.
Really?
Yes.
Fishman and Son.
Partners.
50-50.
That's terrific.
Thank you.
Isn't that wonderful?
- Yeah, it is.
Oh, yes.
Jackson will bring a more youthful take on things.
Anyway, we were talking today about your show.
Well...
You tell him.
We love your stuff, Alex.
Everyone does.
I mean...
You've been successful now, what?
Thirty, 35 years?
Mmm.
But?
But right now your work is a hard sell.
I mean, the market is skewing younger these days.
Portraits are not high on people's shopping lists.
They'll come back.
Sure.
Mmm-hmm.
But right now they are not moving like they used to.
And the bottom line is, you wanna sell your stuff.
Don't you?
I'm sorry, Jackson.
I don't know.
Are we talking about selling art or selling stuff?
Don't shoot the messenger.
No, because artists really don't paint to satisfy "the market."
You see what I mean?
Artists actually paint to satisfy themselves.
And if you're going to run a gallery, you know, it's something you need to know.
Relax, Ruth.
Yeah, I will.
Jackson is running a business.
Don't worry.
Exactly.
Exactly.
See, a gallery is a business.
I get what you're saying.
You're saying that Alex should paint what people want him to paint.
That's right.
That's right.
And then maybe when you have a prospective client lined up, you and Alex can go and you can visit the client's apartment.
And you can see the room where they want to hang the painting.
And you can get some color samples of the wall paint.
Fun.
No, that's not what I meant.
Jackson?
Jackson?
Ruth is pulling your leg.
No, she's not.
No.
I'm not.
I'm not.
You were hard on Jackson.
Well, he better get used to it, if he's going to work with artists.
He's just like Lily.
He just wants us to go away.
Okay.
Well, if they do, then it's up to us to let them know that we're not gonna go anywhere.
I don't wanna move to Florida and play shuffleboard.
Or live on some bullshit golf range, a million miles from everything we know.
Nobody's gonna go live in Florida.
Then where are we gonna go?
We don't wanna wake up and find ourselves out on the street.
Oh, for God's sakes!
Nobody's gonna wake up on the streets.
Alex, why do you always have to be so melodramatic all the time?
I just don't like our lives being in the hands of somebody else.
Well, then fine!
Let's do something about it, all right?
Let's take things into our own hands!
All right.
How do we do that?
Look at us.
We've always done what we wanted to, haven't we?
Yeah.
Right?
We got married when it was still illegal in 30 states.
And people kept staring at us in the other 20.
Right?
So tell me, what's finding an apartment in comparison to that?
So let's just go get ourselves a newspaper and start looking.
And what are you laughing at?
What are you doing?
Why are you laughing at me?
You're reminding me of that girl with the glasses that I painted so long ago.
Yeah?
Yes.
Well, here she is.
And I'll tell you one thing.
You're not gonna get my clothes off so easily this time, mister.
Wanna bet?
- Oh, I've got it.
- Okay.
All right.
I've got it.
Take this.
I got it, I got it.
Oh.
Wait a minute now.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Where is...
No, no.
Look at this.
No.
No.
Where?
Here.
Here.
Here.
Here.
It says this one's...
Franklin Street?
Mmm-hmm.
"Cute"?
What's that mean?
That means it's small.
Oh.
So wait a minute.
What about over here?
Oh, no.
Here's one.
Here's one.
Here's one.
Look at this one in Brooklyn.
It's in Brooklyn.
Uh...
Two bedrooms, lots of space and light.
Old world charm.
That sounds great, doesn't it?
That's our listing, Alex.
Oh.
Well, in that case, we should be able to get it cheap, right?
You think?
Yeah!
Why not?
Don't get smart.
What did Dad say?
Oh, your father.
He's unsettled.
He's unsettled?
Honey, he thinks you're too young.
I'm older than you were when you got married.
And what about you?
What do you think about me marrying Alex?
I don't have an opinion.
Of course you do.
What is it?
I'm satisfied.
You're satisfied that I'm getting married?
What do you want?
I want you to be satisfied with that sundae that you're eating.
You know, I want you to be satisfied with the soda that you're drinking.
But you're my mother.
So I want you to be overjoyed that I'm marrying Alex.
You know, at least, I want you to be happy for me.
I'm trying.
Try harder.
Mom is only trying to say that this marriage is gonna be difficult, Ruth.
And what marriage isn't?
There's still so much prejudice, and...
Oh, really, Sarah?
Thank you for telling me.
Think of your children.
Think of your children.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sweetheart.
You can tell Dad that he doesn't want to make me choose between my family and Alex.
Because if he does, you can tell him that my choice is already made.
"And foolish though it may seem to me."
This one sounds really nice.
Listen.
"Dazzling sun-filled corner two-bedroom, built-in bookcases,
"window seats, soaks up the morning sunshine."
That's nice.
Yeah.
Where is it?
It's on 73rd and First.
Do we want to live in Manhattan?
Well, I mean, I think it would be a good change for us.
And we'd be close to Larry and May's place, too.
And how much is it?
It's...
Well, it's a lot.
It's one million, one hundred thousand dollars.
Okay, but...
We can't afford that.
Yes, but there's no harm in looking, honey.
No harm in looking.
Oh...
Look at her.
She recognizes us, honey.
Look at this girl.
Hello.
She hasn't walked yet.
But she's obviously happy to see you.
Of course she is!
Of course she is!
Hey.
Hey.
Look at her.
She's bandaged up.
Can I touch her, Doctor?
Yeah, of course.
Oh, yes.
You're so good.
You hang in there, kiddo.
You hang in there, you hear me?
You're such a good girl.
Hang in there.
Good girl.
That a girl.
I know she's gonna walk.
I know it.
Of course she is.
She's a fighter like you.
Like us.
So what's a junior bedroom?
What do you mean?
Does it have bunk beds?
Well, if it does, you get the top one.
Okay, honey?
This is it.
This is it.
You're kidding.
Yeah.
No, this is it.
It sure sounded better in the paper, didn't it?
We're wasting our time.
No, come on.
We're here.
Well, let's just look.
Okay?
Wait a second.
Which...
It buzzed.
Oh, it did.
Okay.
Got it.
4C. 4C.
Oh, 4C?
Are you sure?
That's what the sign said.
Okay.
That's the...
Come on.
Okay.
All right.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Wow.
Don't even bother.
Let me check this...
It's you again.
Hmm.
I'm afraid so.
It's not as nice as your place.
It's not, is it?
Where's your mom?
Where do you think?
Lying down on the bed.
How's your dog doing?
Well, she survived the operation, but still hasn't moved her hind legs.
She will.
You think so?
Yeah.
I know things like that.
I see.
I'm gonna go get my mom.
...this time in a taxi.
We're going now to Logan Crawford, who is reporting from underneath the FDR with the abandoned taxi.
What's going on?
Pamir.
He hijacked a taxi.
When?
This morning.
Really?
REPORTER:... reporting underneath the FDR Drive.
The driver reported that Mr. Pamir seemed very nervous and he kept on asking, "What are the police doing?"
He also asked about his family and seemed to be saying a prayer.
I don't know.
I think that we should take the 885 that Blue Leggings is offering.
No, we don't want to rush into anything.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's them!
Did you see, honey?
Yeah.
They're not interested in our place anymore.
Now, you don't know that.
Yeah, well they're here, aren't they?
They're just hedging their bets.
Wouldn't you?
This whole thing.
Oh, please.
It's just making me so nervous.
So do you wanna see this place?
Not if it's as bad as the last one.
Well, don't be discouraged.
We're just looking.
Yes.
I didn't know how bad it could be.
It's in the neighborhood.
Remember?
You remember it.
It's the sunny two-bedroom.
Yes.
It's probably in a basement.
It's in the basement.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think this is it.
Oh!
This looks nice.
And it's on the ninth floor!
We've never lived that high up before.
What's his...
I know what it is.
It said Vincent, right?
Here we go.
Yeah.
I think that's it.
There we go.
There we go.
Oh!
Oh, sorry.
Here's a flyer for you, if you want to take that with you.
Sure.
Oh!
Oh, this is so much nicer.
Really.
Didn't I tell you?
Yup.
I mean, look at this entranceway.
I love this kind of an entranceway, honey.
And what about the light?
Yeah.
Very good.
It's not even that bright out today.
Honey, I'm gonna go find some water and take my pill.
All right, all right, all right.
Hey.
Piece of shit.
Here.
Oh, hey, you.
Why do they make it so hard to open?
Childproof.
Of course.
Do you like this place?
It's the best we've seen so far.
Put that back for me.
But it's still not as nice as yours.
Nothing is.
I hope you find a place you like.
So do I.
And when we do, I'm going to invite you to tea.
How is that?
Cool.
Oh!
Sorry.
Okay, I like this place.
I really do.
I really like it a lot.
Come here.
I want to show you something.
Just see this room.
Look at this, honey.
Look.
Oh!
Yes.
I'm gonna talk to the agent.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm doing it.
Yeah.
Nowhere is going to have a view like our place.
But maybe Ruth and I have seen all the views we need to.
Maybe views are for younger people who still have things to look at.
Okay.
We'll look to hear from you guys this afternoon.
Thank you.
Here she is.
Here she is.
Oh, hi.
Excuse me.
Actually, my husband and I are very interested.
Well, I don't have to tell you, this listing is getting a lot of heat.
Oh, yes.
We can see that.
Let me be frank with you.
Can you afford a place like this?
What do you mean?
I only ask, because no one's gonna give you a 30-year mortgage.
We don't need a mortgage.
Oh!
Well, then make an offer.
The owners are willing to consider anything.
But they're only accepting bids until 3:00.
That's two hours.
Mmm-hmm.
Have your offer here by then.
They'll make their decision right away.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Ma'am?
Yes?
A lot of people include a personal message with their offer.
What kind of personal message?
Something that persuades the seller to give it to you, in case there's a tie.
Just don't be afraid to pull on the heartstrings.
Oh.
Right.
How do you like that one talking to us like we don't know anything?
I bet we've got more real money than all those young hotshots anyway.
But I just want to know.
What did you think of it?
I liked it.
Really?
Yeah.
Let's bid on it.
How?
We haven't sold our own place yet.
No, but we will.
We will.
We had a bunch of offers.
And you heard the real estate broker say that they are very willing to consider anything until 3:00.
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.
Any offer that's, like, until 3:00.
It's a beautiful apartment.
Yeah, it's all right.
It has a lot of light.
Yes.
It has light.
It has an elevator.
And more room.
New paint.
Honey, come on.
Let's do it.
Come on.
It sounds like something you really want.
In that case, we'll see another doctor.
What for?
He'll say the same thing the others did.
Maybe not.
Alex, you know he will.
It's the most natural thing in the world and I can't even do it.
My mother, my sisters, they churn them out like machines, one after another.
We don't need children.
No one needs children, Alex.
People want them.
I want them.
You want them.
Shit!
Shit!
I am a goddamned failure.
You are not a failure.
I've disappointed you.
You've never disappointed me, Ruth.
I can see it in your face.
Stop saying that.
You have classrooms full of children, those are your kids.
That's not the same thing.
Then me.
I'm your kid.
You're always telling me what a big baby I am.
Well, you are.
You really like it, don't you?
I do.
And, honey, admit it.
You do, too.
I mean, I know...
I know...
Wait a second.
I know it's not our place, but we're never gonna find another place like our place.
And we won't find anything better than this.
So, Alex, I mean, it's just...
What is it?
It's a bid.
It's not a commitment.
It's like...
You know, we're not going to find...
They're never going to take it.
Trust me, they're never going to take it.
All right, fine.
Let's do it.
Really?
Yeah.
Should we call Lily?
No.
I mean, you said you thought we should do this ourselves.
So I think we should, but be smart.
What do you think we should offer?
Well...
I mean...
Not so low that we have no chance.
I know.
But not so high that we're stuck with something that we can't afford.
So what would be the point of that, right?
Right, yeah.
I don't know.
Look, this is what I think.
I think $900,000.
That's too low. $910,000.
You think?
I don't know.
Well, uh...
You think?
$910,000?
$920,000.
No, $920,000.
No, but that's too much.
That's way too much.
Honey, do you want the place or not?
Yes.
I definitely want the place.
I want to be in the running.
Yes.
So $920,000.
$920,000.
No. $925,000.
It's more impressive.
Whoa!
Listen to you!
What?
You sound like you're some sort of an auctioneer!
Twenty-five?
Okay, do I hear $930,000?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, $930,000.
$930,000?
That's a lot better.
I mean, so what the heck?
It's just money.
This is hard to write, when I don't know exactly what these people are like.
Tell them I'm senile and I want to live by the zoo.
Be serious, please.
How about donating a park bench with their name on it?
Okay.
Just tell them we love the place.
Breaking news.
The bartender, Debbie Hoffman, who claimed that Pamir robbed her cash register has now been charged with theft and misleading police after she admitted that she took the money.
Yeah.
I knew there was something wrong with that.
Alex?
Oh, my God.
Alex?
What?
We got the apartment!
What?
Already?
Yeah.
Isn't that wonderful?
Now, they want us to come over with the check right now.
Right now?
That's what they said.
I don't know.
You don't know what?
I mean, I think we should wait.
For what?
Well, we don't wanna be giving our money to somebody with all this going on.
You know what?
We're gonna lose this apartment.
That's what we're gonna do.
We're not gonna lose it.
Well, what am I going to say to the real estate broker?
Just tell them we...
We...
We...
What?
Tell them we can't get there right now.
They're gonna take the next best offer, Alex.
No, they won't.
Yes, they are.
No, they won't.
Uh...
Wait.
Don't pick it up.
Don't!
Don't pick it up.
Why?
The sellers are getting anxious.
If we don't hear from you soon, they're going to open up the bidding again.
You heard what she said.
They're gonna reopen the bidding.
She's bluffing.
She's not bluffing.
Right now we're the only ones that are bluffing.
Come on, honey.
We've gone this far.
We can't back down now.
The last thing we need, Ruth, is for somebody else to be pushing us into something.
Nobody is pushing us into anything.
Take things into our own hands.
That's what you said, honey.
I know what I said.
Will you please look at me?
All day yesterday I heard you complain about being treated like garbage and ending up on the streets.
And then finally last night, we decide to make a move, but only if we have total control.
So we look at a few places.
And then finally...
Finally we get excited about one, we make an offer and Io and behold we get it.
We actually get the place.
And now you wanna back down?
Listen, if you wanna take control, this is how we take control, honey!
All I'm saying, Ruth, is this is a lot of money!
I know!
But if we walk away from this we'll just be acting like a couple of old fools!
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hey?
Oh, my God!
Oh.
Everybody is still crazy out there.
I wish they would go ahead and find this guy already.
Jesus.
All right.
Here's where we are.
Blue Leggings is our last solid bid at 885.
But the dog ladies have called and they wanna come by in a few minutes with a counter bid.
Apparently, they wanna do it in person, because they wanna make some kind of...
What's the matter?
Oh!
Aunt Ruth, what happened?
We saw a place this morning.
What do you mean you saw a place?
We went to an open house this morning and we loved it.
You went to an open house today?
If you knew you were ready to look...
I don't understand.
Why didn't you call me first?
What?
Wait.
We don't need to be asking you for permission.
No, I realize that, but I have listings, too.
I have stacks of listings and I have done a lot of work for you.
This isn't the easiest market.
Why didn't you call me first, Aunt Ruth?
I'm sorry, Lily.
I really am sorry.
I don't know what I was...
It wasn't her idea.
It was mine.
You know, an apartment might not be the best idea for you right now.
There are other...
Bullshit!
Wait a minute now!
We'll decide where we're going to live.
Okay.
Okay.
Have it your way.
Where is it?
This place that you like so much?
It's in Manhattan.
Yeah, it's on 73rd and First.
It's just so beautiful.
And how much is it?
A million, one.
A million, one!
Mmm-hmm.
I don't know.
We made an offer.
I don't believe this.
Well, they accepted it.
Well, what did you offer?
$930,000.
And they took it?
Yeah.
Yes.
That's not bad.
Oh.
So we're not such fools after all, huh?
Okay.
Okay.
Uh...
Let's get real here for a minute.
So nobody buys an apartment nowadays before they sell their own.
Especially not with what's going on out there.
Who's the agent?
I have the card.
Wait, I know where it is.
I know I have it.
I know where it is.
Wait.
A woman, or...
No, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Yeah.
Oh.
Okay.
Miriam.
Miriam.
Miriam...
Carswell?
She's a shark!
What?
She's gonna eat you for breakfast!
What did she say?
They want the deposit.
Well, of course they do.
When?
Right now.
What did you tell them?
Well, we haven't called her back yet.
No, but wait a minute.
We want this apartment.
Well, then it is crucial that you sell this place fast!
Okay.
Okay, give me a minute to think this through.
Um...
I'm gonna...
Yeah!
I'm gonna call Miriam.
Okay.
Let me handle her.
Oh, God, she is upset.
Hey, Miriam...
I don't know why she couldn't talk to them in front of us.
I hope we haven't stepped on her toes.
I don't want them making deals behind our backs.
I really didn't know the protocol.
We just saw an apartment we liked and...
Well, she'll live.
Okay, here's where we stand.
I convinced Miriam that you're serious, but that you have to rest.
I reminded her how old you are.
I reassured her that we would all be there by 5:00 with the deposit.
Okay.
What time is it, though?
What time do we...
It's 3:30.
And the dog ladies will be here any second, so...
Wait, wait, Lily.
Now, aren't we moving a little quickly here?
May I remind you that you're the ones who want to buy a new apartment.
This is how it works.
Dog eat dog.
You snooze, you lose.
Okay.
And one more thing,
I told Miriam that I'm the one who steered you to her listing.
So if she asks, back me up.
The least you can do is help me get a piece of the commission on it, right?
Well, sure.
I mean, obviously.
That's only fair, Lily.
Okay.
So let me know as soon as you hear the dog ladies' offer.
And keep your fingers crossed that it's at least $950,000, because that's what we need to make this work.
9-5-0.
Otherwise we're screwed.
Man!
She really does talk too much.
Authorities may be one step closer to catching the terror suspect Abdul Pamir.
Police have released security camera footage that appears to show Pamir looking over his shoulder and showing obvious concern.
Oh, God.
Doorbell.
I know.
I know.
Move it.
Move it, handsome.
Why, hello.
Hi.
I hope you don't mind us just stopping by like this.
We were training Harold in the park.
We're here to make an offer.
Oh, well, please come in.
Would you like something to drink?
Anything?
Oh, no.
We don't want to intrude.
Just give them the bid, Annie.
Yes.
So this is as high as we can go.
How is your dog doing?
Mmm...
Well, it's actually kind of touch-and-go, so...
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Harold's actually not doing so well, either.
In school.
He has a learning disability.
We think.
Oh.
Give her the...
Well, they...
Here you go.
So this is our letter.
In case there's a tie.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh, Harold.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Harold, you concentrate, now.
Do you hear me?
Don't open that letter till you've read their offer.
What?
I said don't open that letter till you read their offer.
No, I won't.
Will you please open it?
Oh.
Hello.
Hi, Lily.
Yep.
The offer is $950,000.
All right.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
That's good.
$950,000.
Mmm-hmm.
Fine.
That's good.
All right.
Bye.
That is absolutely wonderful.
We can make this work.
Is Lily gonna call them and give them the good news?
She's gonna call the others first and see if they wanna make a counter offer.
Yeah?
What?
No.
Tell them they can keep their lousy $1,000.
Hang on.
Hang on.
What?
Lily?
Lily, what happened?
The matching sweaters offered $951,000.
But here's the good news.
Dr. Gilbert's gonna e-mail you a counter offer.
Wait.
Okay.
But who is Dr. Gilbert?
Blue Leggings.
Oh, no.
Let me know what it is as soon as you get it.
We have to get over to the other place in half an hour.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay.
Bye.
Will you check the e-mail?
Yeah.
I know how to use the Internet.
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. Carver..."
My partner and I moved to New York only a few years ago.
And as you probably know better than most, it's not always been easy for us.
We've been trying to adopt for nearly six years and it looks like we'll finally have a baby daughter.
A little girl from India.
Your husband's studio would make such a wonderful room for her.
Full of light and love.
Please consider letting us live in your wonderful home.
Shoot.
Honey, what?
Ruth, do this.
Um...
No, let me get it.
Let me get it for you.
Let me get it.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You do it.
You do it.
It's all right.
Got it.
Got it, got it.
Okay, well.
Blue Leggings made an offer.
What is it?
$960,000.
Nine...
That's good!
Uh...
I don't know.
Yeah.
What?
You're disappointed?
No.
It's just...
Honey, I read the dog ladies' letter.
And I just think we should give them a chance to counter offer.
Just...
Ruth, you heard that lady say this was their final offer.
See, I told you not to read that letter.
I know.
But they're adopting a little girl.
These people are offering $10,000 more!
But do we really want someone like that living here?
Honey?
Do we?
I'm just asking.
Ruth?
We're talking 10 grand.
All day we've been throwing numbers back and forth, like they don't mean anything.
850, 900, 950.
Sugar, we're not rich.
We need to get a grip on reality here.
I know.
You're right.
It's just...
I wish we could give it to them.
I wish a lot of things.
I wish we could give our apartment to whoever needed it.
I wish we could give it to that lady on the bed and her little girl.
Most of all, I wish I could run up and down the damn stairs, like I used to, for the rest of my life.
Ugh.
Okay.
It's right there.
I got it.
I got it.
Here it is.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, Doctor.
What?
Really?
What?
What?
Really?
She walked.
She walked?
She walked?
Yes.
Dorothy walked!
I knew she would.
High-five.
Yes.
Let me tell you.
What?
Once I give them this check...
Yeah.
...there's no turning back.
I know.
Everything is different.
Good different, honey.
Good different.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Now, wait.
Okay, here it is.
Who is it?
Oh, my husband and I are here with the deposit.
Hello?
Hello, there!
You sure you got the right apartment?
I'm sure.
Yeah.
Hello?
We've come to buy the apartment!
Yes, we're...
Your broker!
We're meeting with your broker!
She told us to meet her here!
I know who you are.
Your agent isn't here yet.
You can wait for her outside.
Oh, that's nice.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am going to call Lily.
'Cause that's rude.
No, no, no.
Here comes somebody.
Oh, good.
That's just...
I'm calling Lily.
Lily!
Oh!
It's show time.
Okay.
I don't want to take it.
I want to wait.
We have to take it.
We can't wait.
Who the hell is that?
That's their agent.
I said not later than 5:00.
I'm coming!
For Christ's sake.
Great.
They've been holding us hostage all afternoon, now they can't wait to get in.
Hi!
Hi.
How did you get in?
Uh...
Gentleman with the dog.
So much for security.
Come on in.
Oh.
Thank you.
This is Mrs. Carver.
Hi.
This is Mr. Carver.
I'm Lily Portman.
Hi.
How are you?
Hi.
I'm Lily Portman.
How are you?
I need to talk to my wife.
This is Mrs. Carver...
Sure.
Let's just go inside then.
Okay.
Thank you.
Great.
I don't want to take the offer.
I don't want to take it.
We don't have to take it.
I know.
Fine.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's get down to business.
Hey, Miriam.
Hello.
So we have the deposit check.
Great.
What if we refuse it?
Why would you refuse it?
Hold on.
'Cause maybe we want to open the bidding back up.
Why would you want to do that?
So we can get better offers.
These two have been holding us hostage all afternoon.
Nobody's been holding you hostage.
Okay.
All right.
Relax, everybody.
They're here now.
And this is the best offer you've gotten.
Especially while all that shit drags on out there.
If you refuse my client's check, it will be up to the courts to decide.
Your kid could be out of college by the time this thing is resolved.
Is that what you want?
Take his damn check.
Okay.
This way.
Do they even know what they're doing?
We know what we're doing.
Who do I make it out to?
Stephen Vincent.
Is that a "P-H" or a "V"?
P-H!
Something's happening.
Oh!
It's the terrorist thing!
What's happening?
It looks like they found him or something.
Logan, what do you see?
Oh, my God!
And the suspect in this terrorism plot, Abdul Pamir...
In fact, there he is right now.
I can see him.
He's coming out.
That's him.
He has his hands over his head.
Yeah.
Wow.
Uh-oh.
He appears to be surrendering.
Now police is sending in a canine unit to sniff the suspect, to see if there is actually a bomb or device.
There is a dog checking the suspect now.
Wait a second.
He seems very calm.
That might be a bomb there, though.
The dog has walked off now.
That means there is likely no device, no bomb.
Get him off the streets for good.
Very, very good news indeed.
MRS.
- That's his white flag.
Wow.
- It's good they got him.
- Lock him up.
You can hear the choppers up ahead as well.
New York City's Finest is doing their job and they have got their man.
And they are about to put the bracelets on him.
Shoot the son of a bitch.
Right in the balls.
Come on.
Look at him.
Heck, he's just a kid!
Well, what did you expect?
I don't know.
A monster.
Anything but this.
What did he really do?
That little prick cost me 50 grand.
That's what he did.
You need to let it go.
We can all rest easier now, knowing this terrorist is off our streets.
Isn't it a little bit too early to actually convict this young man?
The poor guy.
Poor guy, my ass!
I knew we should have waited.
You are the one that said to take the first decent offer that we got.
I remind you.
You are obligated to take my client's offer.
Yes?
- Yes.
Just...
All right.
Just sign the thing already.
- We're gonna sign.
Just sign where indicated, Mr. Carver.
I'm not signing.
Alex, are you all right?
What do you mean you're not signing it?
I mean I'm not signing the damn thing.
What's he talking about?
Jesus Christ.
Give me a break.
We don't want your apartment.
Alex, what are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing, Lily?
I'm putting an end to this bullshit.
All day long we've been pulled back and forth, back and forth.
Only to come up here and hear these two accuse us of I don't know what!
Nobody is accusing you of anything.
I understand that's what...
No...
Whoa, whoa.
Wait.
Please.
Let him finish, okay?
We don't want your apartment.
Put it back on the market.
I hope they get a billion dollars for it!
You know, when one door closes, another door opens.
Okay.
Thank you, Lily.
Thanks.
Alex?
Alex?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I gotta get out of here.
No...
Wait a second.
Wait.
You can't just storm off like that.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Ruth.
But seeing that young man, kneeling on the ground like that.
It just made me realize that we're just like everybody else today.
Getting all worked up over nothing.
Yeah.
Why are we moving?
What are we chasing?
Haven't we built a good life?
I only meant to help.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I know that.
I know.
I know, Ruth.
You know, you're probably gonna live to be 100.
Mmm-hmm.
I hope so.
I don't want to live without you.
And I really don't care.
You know that, right?
I don't care if we stay in Brooklyn or we move to Moscow.
I just want what's best for you.
And us.
Let's go home.
God, I love you, you silly old man.
I don't know what just went down in there, but it could work for us.
You lost this place.
It doesn't matter.
I've got plenty of others.
The good news is that you didn't accept any of the offers on your apartment.
And what he said is true, things are gonna go up, now that that idiot's off the streets.
And we could hold out for a million dollars.
Maybe more.
No, Lily...
No?
No, what?
Too much?
No.
It's too little!
We're not holding out, Lily.
We're not selling.
What do you mean?
I've got solid offers.
I can get you better ones.
You can't back out now.
Lily, we can do whatever the hell we want.
But...
Selling is the right thing for you.
It's the right thing for you.
You're just acting this way, because you're scared.
We're not scared.
We're doing it, because it's the right thing to do.
And he's right, Lily.
We don't need to sell right now.
Will you just...
Will you just stop for a minute?
What?
Listen, you cannot live in that apartment forever.
We can't live anywhere forever.
No, but we can manage there for a while.
This is ridiculous.
What about all the work I put in, Ruth?
There's just really nothing more to say.
I'm sorry.
Well, then I'm gonna say it.
You're a crazy old man, who doesn't know what's good for you.
Hey, no, you do not speak to him like that!
And you're no better!
Fuck you both!
I guess we won't be going to her place for Thanksgiving this year.
You hate her stuffing, anyway.
It took a while for Dorothy to get back on her feet.
But, by the time winter set in, she and I had returned to our usual routine.
Hi.
I thought that was you two.
Hey.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing, honey?
Look at you.
Did you manage to get any paint on the walls?
Funny.
What?
Didn't that bad man feed you?
Yes.
She ate.
She doesn't think so.
Well, she is either confused or lying.
Here.
How's it going in there?
Oh, thanks.
Well...
Uh, it's going.
Good.
Mmm-hmm.
Can I see?
Mmm-hmm.
See, nobody told me that painting would be this hard.
Oh, jeez.
I'm sorry about that.
Not sorry enough.
What do you think?
Huh?
It's good, huh?
Yeah.
It looks very good.
I like it better than this gray that you chose.
Thanks.
Why are you still painting this old lady?
What old lady?
Ooh.
Good answer.
Look at that.
Those few days were like one big roller coaster ride.
And, like most rides, we ended up where we began.
Still, it reminded us who we are.
What we have.
It was worth it, if only for that.
Maybe one day we'll sell.
Stop climbing the stairs.
But for now we'll just deal with what is.
The important thing is it brought us back here.
Together.
Back to our senses.
And to our home.
So good to meet you.
Mwah.
Mwah!
You're adorable, you fucking peanut.
(indistinct chattering)
I love it.
You guys.
Oh, God bless.
So good.
Guys, take it easy!
So love you.
Obsessed with you.
Ew.
What the fuck, man?
Faggot convention over here.
How did Peter end up with that total fucking troll?
What in the gay hell?
He kept cornering me all night.
Oh!
And his breath-- it, like, smelled like old pennies.
Yes!
That's exactly what it was.
Hey, man, can I get a cigarette and a light for a dollar, please?
Here, hand me those so you can--
What was that about?
It was like, skin tags, take them off your face.
They're called tags for a reason.
Thank you.
You know what I mean?
Thank you!
Just, like, all over his face.
Just on and on-- you know?
Oh, I don't have a dollar.
Anyway, did you notice too how his Adam's apple literally looked like he had swallowed an arrowhead or--
So sharp, so gross.
So sharp!
Fucking Olivia-- unbelievable.
You can't just not wear a bra.
You did not wear a bra.
She's looking good since she did Blue Print, you must admit.
Oh my God, do not even say that.
This tastes like spunk.
But it's like, how am I supposed to express my creativity and, like, really stretch my wings if they don't give me a budget?
Like, I'm a bird in a cage, literally, right now.
And I have to shit and I'm in Meatpacking--
Can you-- can you stop by the Duane Reade and get me some tampons?
It's like Nicole Simpson up in here.
This is your selection, isn't it?
I can tell this is yours because it's really well curated.
Woke up this morning, made me an exquisite breakfast--
So hot.
But I had plans with Benjamin and I made him pick me up at Jonathan's house.
You're such a slut.
I'm obsessed with you.
Uh, why do you keep making me do this?
I'm a bad friend.
Oh, my god, hide me, hide me.
Please just, like, help me.
You're being so dramatic.
No, you don't understand.
You're such a queen sometimes.
No, he fisted me at Kanye's secret show in the Boom Boom Room at The Standard.
You've got to stop letting people put their fist up there.
Just put your face in front of mine.
Ah, this is ridiculous.
(laughs) Hi.
I gotta say, originally I was kind of upset that you guys had a kid, 'cause he was kind of screwing up my income stream, but he's really cute!
I would have had you here every week for the last two years if she wasn't breastfeeding.
I still really want it, though.
Are you guys doing anything fun tonight?
Well, not tonight.
But tomorrow night, my mom is taking him and we're gonna go up to Beacon and stay with friends and... (whispers) get fucked up
(speaks normally) and just sleep.
(phone chirping)
Ah, sorry, one second.
I want this one!
Hi.
You still at the same address?
Max:
Yeah, and I don't really have a lot of time.
No, okay, that's fine.
I'll be in like an hour.
Okay, can you get here sooner than that, though?
I pressed X!
"I pressed X!" We'll see.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, and also the one device in the entire world that doesn't have Black Book on it.
So, thanks, Dad.
Merry Christmas, faggot.
Lainey:
Oh my God, kill yourself, Olivia.
Just fucking kill yourself.
Have you seen her Facebook profile?
She's listing herself as an artist.
Listen, you dumb bitch, just cutting up a Klimt coffee table book and making collages does not make you an artist.
Her Tumblr is actually beautiful, though.
Oh my God!
Do not even say that.
You're just enabling her mediocrity.
Hey, hey, dumb bitch, your boyfriend tried to sleep with me after the Ginger and Rosa screening.
Idiot.
Hey, man, are you going to give us a discount since you were actually two hours late for us?
No.
It's Friday night.
I'm very busy.
Okay, calm down.
Okay, so it's $50?
All right, so, babe, money.
No, I didn't take out any cash today.
I have $63 in my account.
I'm waiting on a paycheck.
Are you serious right now?
I don't even smoke.
I'm not paying for this.
We got this weed because we told Erika-- you told Erika that we would trade her for coke.
Okay, you're gonna smoke half the bag before we even give it to her.
So I'll shit out $50 right now?
Where am I going to get $50?
Just-
- Max, just go down to the bodega.
It's literally a 45-second walk--
No-- no bodega.
Because bodega takes $2, Chase takes $3.
Go into overdraft immediately.
You are so ghetto.
You guys need to have this shit figured out before I get here.
No, no, it's fine.
We'll just-- we'll all go to the Chase
No.
No, no, no, no.
or the Duane Reade together.
That's not how it works, dude.
Listen, why don't I just stay here with her and you can go down to the Duane Reade?
Are you fucking serious right now?
I am not staying here alone with a shady drug dealer.
Man:
Where are you?
Hey, man.
Need to leave soon.
Yeah, it's taking a little while.
I'll be there.
About fucking time.
Oh, I can't--
Um, no!
Bumped right into us!
Are you fucking kidding me?
Max:
Oh, my god!
Hey!
Hey!
Okay.
Are we doing this?
Okay!
Sorry, that's our drug deal--
Like an angel!
Max:
You are so cute!
(indistinct) Bye!
(indistinct) He was at Bonnaroo and he had a drug trip and it, like, changed him.
Is that rose gold?
Yeah.
Ugh!
I love rose gold.
When I get married, I'm gonna get a rose-gold band with, like, black diamonds.
Good.
Thank you so much.
A-plus customer service from you.
I wish I could tip you.
Uh, I have got to rally!
I am so not feeling this tonight.
I know, I feel like poop.
(singing softly)
Not cool, man.
What?
You're gonna give me 50 more dollars?
Why would I do that?
You know why.
Oh my God, you guys.
Drama!
What's going on?
Your friend knows what's going on.
I really-
- I don't know what you're talking about.
I came here with nine bags and now I only have seven.
So you either give me back the one you took or you give me another $50.
Well, I took one from you, which I literally just paid you for.
So I think our transaction is over and you should be walking out of my door right now.
Just give it back.
I'm not gonna do anything.
Just give it back or--
Or what?
You're going to call the police?
File a report?
You know what?
Fuck it.
You can have it.
And I hope you enjoy it because you're blacklisted now.
Have a good night, assholes.
Yeah, you smell like dick cheese.
You were molested as a kid.
I like this, so I'm gonna take it.
Thanks for the tip, chuckleheads.
(door closes)
It's okay, I took three bags.
That stupid stoner doesn't even know how to count.
How do you think he knew you were molested?

Previously on Project Runway...
Here is to season 13 of Project Runway.
The fans of the show voted to bring back a former project runway designer.
It's Amanda Valentine from season 11.
I'm back.
For this first challenge, you're going to give the judges one look for spring.
Sandhya's look, it's kind of weird.
Angela is running around the workroom like a mad woman.
Excuse me.
You took something and made it into a fantasy.
You have the creativity to make it in this show.
Sandhya, you are the winner of this challenge.
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
I was the only one that called that.
Everyone else thought you were in the bottom.
I'm confused.
I have no clue anymore what the judges are looking for.
I thought this was terrible.
It looks like she's wearing some big diaper.
Jefferson, I'm sorry.
That means you're out.
[Sniffs] Wake up.
Wake up.
Oh, snap.
Popcorn?
Breakfast, what's up?
This morning there's popcorn on our kitchen counter.
We're a little bit confused at what this next challenge is gonna be.
We've got a note.
"Good morning, designers.
"We are sending you out for a little morning matinee.
"We've arranged a private screening for you at the village east cinema.
"Hugs and kisses, Heidi and
Tim." Oh, ho.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
I'm thinking we're gonna design for a particular movie?
Okay, we'll have to dress a movie star.
Like something to go into the movie?
Something three-dimensional.
Not just two-dimensional.
Or is it about popcorn.
Is it red carpet?
I'm into that.
Exciting.
That's so cool.
The first runway show was exciting.
Seeing Sandhya win was a shocker.
Only because the design wasn't my favorite.
We all thought Sandhya was in the bottom and that she was gonna go home.
I think it's getting late, guys.
We should start getting ready.
Movie day.
I love movies.
Walking into the theater today is so exciting.
Enjoy the show.
Wow.
Cool.
Oh, my God.
We're walking through the door and it's insane.
Like there's gonna be something so crazy to this because there clearly not sending us to the movie theater just to go watch a movie.
You know it's gonna be a kick-ass challenge.
In a world where fashion has forever ruled the silver screen.
Looking at the trailer, my heart starts racing, like, oh, this is so cool.
The movie experience has been enjoyed by everyone, big and small, for over 100 years.
Hello, designers.
You didn't think I would just let you kick back and have a day at the movies, did you?
No.
You're here because your next challenge is all about the movies.
You will be incorporating your movie experience into your fashion designs, because this is an unconventional challenge.
Ugh.
It's an unconventional challenge.
Honestly, I'm a little bit scared.
I can't believe that they put it this soon in the competition.
Woot!
I am excited for an unconventional challenge.
I'm here to prove I can adjust to whatever direction I have because I am a great designer.
You will be using the array of movie and movie experience items found in this theater as materials for your challenge.
You'll have access to items like the camera and lighting department materials, the art department props, costume and wardrobe, and even the concession items you'd find in a movie theater like this.
Action!
Yea.
Hi.
Hi.
I love the unconventional challenges, I have to tell you.
I also love this particular challenge because it really is about fashion in film.
And I have another twist.
[Nervous chuckle] You're each sitting in a group of three, and each of the five groups of three comprise our five teams.
The designers you are sitting with are your teammates.
I can't get away from it.
Teams?
Come on.
I remember this feeling.
I hope this isn't the only one.
I'm like, second challenge?
I see a mixed range of emotions.
Sitting next to my team is
Hernan, Carrie, and Sandhya.
That's probably the worst team possible, and I would not want to be on that team.
I am very surprised that Sandhya won the first challenge, and I do wish that she didn't have immunity.
Each team must create three cohesive unconventional looks.
You will have 15 minutes to assemble as much of the unconventional materials as you like.
There's a ton of additional product at the concession stand in the lobby.
Furthermore, you'll only be able to leave the theater with what you can physically carry.
Oh, jeez.
You have one day for this challenge.
All right.
Design teams.
Action!
Boom!
I'm out, and I'm the first one down there so I can get all these sparkly, beautiful blue iridescents.
So many different colors.
Angela was freaking out.
Everyone's claws are out.
Everyone's crashing into each other.
I think it's really hard because it's such a tight space.
Is everyone checking in with their teammates?
Yes.
Okay.
We decide we're gonna grab all of the same color palate, and I took every single white straw.
You good, Mitch?
Yeah.
And look at all this.
I got probably the last two.
Shredded.
Everything is done.
All right, designers.
Time is up.
Let's head back to the workroom.
It looks like you're taking the cinema with you.
Hey, there's popcorn over there too.
We have chain?
Yeah, she got chain.
Whoo.
I think we can cut it up.
Unconventional really gets to show your creative side.
Be funny.
Be quirky.
Make something that looks really wearable or you can do something over the top.
That smell of popcorn is intoxicating.
Wow.
Some business at hand.
There will be a winning team.
One designer from that team will win this challenge.
There will be a losing team, and one designer from that team will be eliminated.
There are no team leaders.
You're each responsible for the work of the team.
However, don't sit in the back seat and let two other designers drive you.
And, Sandhya, be very happy that you have immunity.
All right, I will see you later.
Have fun.
Thank you.
Oh, wow.
I've got a [Bleep]
Plan that I'm so stoked on.
We should talk about the colors, like, the green would be really interesting with the black and white.
Totally.
You know, we all feel like the futurism, right?
Yeah.
Like the 1960s future.
Yeah.
We're so stoked.
We immediately think science fiction.
We all kind of have that little bit of vintage vibe, but we're going into the future.
Fifth element'one of my favorite movies, so...
I kind of want to keep it obviously sleek, like we all are.
More structured, nothing droopy.
You'll go more fifth element, you'll go more like 2001, and I'll go more barbarella.
Ooh.
By a stroke of pure luck, we're all kind of feeling the same vibe.
I don't know how that happened.
The only thing, this is where you'll get [Bleep] from the judges, because anytime you use something that is so close to fabric, like you have to-- what they respond to is when you
make your own textile.
I'm literally the only person that's done this before.
What do you guys have?
I have, like, a million ideas, and I don't know how to condense them in one.
Everything I got is, like, very futuristic.
Sandhya, come on, baby.
What?
Do you have something to cut this?
I have a lot of people who work with me.
I do a lot of freelancers so, for me, it is easy to work with team.
Get the site on a sheet and then-- we can't figure out the change until we see the material.
Let's do whatever we want to, and then look at it, and then, like, try and bring it together so that there's cohesion, because otherwise we won't even start and it would be like a clash.
Yeah, yeah.
We're on the same page.
Obviously when there are three people in the team that have very different aesthetics, if you try to force things, you know, it breaks.
You know, our materials are very industrial, and I really like that idea of, like, doing the headpieces.
Yeah, take them apart.
Maybe, like, take them apart, and maybe we can do, like, shoes.
The overall vision for us is more of a high fashion, avant-garde vibe.
I like all your ideas.
Good job.
We should have, like, a blue collection.
And kind of just do, like, do a sexy number with this.
I like that.
Yes.
We took each other's styles and kind of meshed it all together, and we honed in on cocktail dresses in a blue tint.
Perfect.
Yeah.
How do we tie this to the movies?
Maybe if we just try to make a woman like a strong, dark femme fatal, or like villains of the cinema.
My garment is going to be a textural coat of cut straws.
Like a Cruella de vil, dalmatian fur jacket.
It ties in so well.
I don't know what it is.
Does it have to be villain?
Can it be, like, fairy or, like, angel, villain.
I just feel like that angels has nothing kind of to do with the movies.
Last year I had my wedding.
I filled it with white paper flowers to create this really beautiful texture.
So I just want to work with that.
In the movies there's always a good guy, a bad guy, like, this is kind of-- right, I just want to play the good guy.
Ari can be mystery creepy.
All right.
Try to make it as evil as you can.
Angela's seems to be not very flexible in her design process.
Do your thing, what you do best, hon.
I go back to gluing.
Are you good?
Are you stressed out?
Yeah.
No.
That's good.
Okay.
I feel nervous.
I get intimidated, so I don't know if I'll be able to make it, pull it through.
I know I might be in trouble.
Today's unconventional material challenge is taking movie-inspired items and turning them into fabulous garments.
We're in groups of three, and we make three pieces, and they all have to be cohesive.
Today's challenge is a one day challenge, so it's gonna be like, eekh!
And when you put skirts on and that's it.
You're just slipping it in?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
So when I took these numbers on transparencies, they reminded me of how when a movie starts, you know, it goes, five, four, three, two, one.
It has its own meaning of speed, motion, of this anticipation of waiting for things to happen.
Sandhya, you're not doing those numbers and letters, are you?
I am.
I am.
But how does that correspond?
Exactly.
So the thing is, if we are using the same materials and similar techniques, it will end up looking like three same looks, just done differently.
Okay.
In my experience designing collections and what they want to see, they're gonna say something about that, and I'm not sure it's gonna be a positive thing.
I want to do what I believe in and what I am as a designer.
Right, mm-hmm.
If I go home for that, I-- well, you won't.
Sandhya is kind of confusing me, because she says, "you guys just tell me what you're doing and
I'll just follow along." But then sometimes she'll be like, "oh, well, I'm gonna do this because I feel strong about this, because it's me as a designer." We need to have one
story of a girl that can wear three looks.
Exactly.
That's what I was trying to tell you.
It needs to look like a collection, not the same materials made three different ways.
I am going to be as open as possible, but when one person strays, everything else can fall apart.
I talked to Sandhya because I don't like the number thing on her skirt.
We have to be in the same idea.
Right.
Like, I came in with a fresh perspective and it, like, stood out right away.
I was like, "what?
Is she doing that?" After, like, two hours into the challenge, I had a feeling this was a sinking Titanic.
Hernan and Carrie just started bitching about me as soon as I left the room.
Too different.
It just doesn't go.
I was very surprised she did that, though.
I was not expecting her to just stray like that.
If you look like a cheerleader.
Cheerleader skirt.
Hernan, Carrie, and Sandhya are a mess.
Sandhya is not agreeing with their ideas.
They're not agreeing with her idea.
They need to focus on making it cohesive.
Yes, girl.
My dress.
Who would have thunk?
It's a mermaid.
Want me to make you a tail?
I'm missing my scissors, my favorite scissors.
Oh.
Somebody took it.
I have been in fashion week twice before.
I have my own brand since 2009, because my grandfather is my investor.
2012 my grandfather pass away.
Is somebody who believes so much in me that it's impossible for me to talk without crying.
Hey, girl.
Oh.
Thanks.
I was born in moscow, Russia.
It was at the end of the whole communist regime.
We basically escaped here with almost nothing.
I started sewing when I was about ten years old.
I applied to my dream college,
Otis college of art and design, and I got in and it really honed my skills.
So it's a nice evolution.
That's cute.
That's some darth vader chic going on.
[Imitates darth vader breathing]
I'm originally from east Germany.
I escaped to the west before the wall came down.
I got into fashion because I couldn't find anything for myself, and I slowly expanded it into women's fashion.
And I am self-taught.
And naturally talented.
Maybe it would be even interesting to have the print showing?
Because it's movies script.
I like it the white.
Okay.
Because it gives some texture, and it's not too busy.
I was born in Hong Kong, and I wanted to be a fashion designer ever since I was young, but money was tight when we were growing up, so I decided to go into computer engineering.
After graduation, I started full time job, but I still had this yearning to do fashion design, so I quit my job, and now I'm starting my fashion design career.
I'm good?
Like, right there.
Like a lot, right?
Yeah.
My model is going to be a sweaty assed you know what.
How is everyone?
[Laughs]
A lot of meaningful eye glances and no words.
All right.
Well, I'm going to check in with each of our teams.
So talk to me.
What are you doing?
What is that?
This is the cd.
Oh, they're cds.
Yeah.
So once this gets picked up it kind of does its little shape thing.
They're like fish scales.
Yes.
Yeah, fish scales.
You know what I love about this?
I didn't know what it was.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I used the hats at the hips.
What are they?
They're the yellow hats.
Oh.
Yeah.
So I stitched them into the muslin, and then I've been, like, hot gluing all the tape here.
Emily's look I just don't get.
I don't see any woman wanting two big hips on the side of them.
That big like that.
I just--I didn't get it.
We kind of just went with a theme.
With cocktail dresses.
This is made out of the popcorn bags.
The braiding detail, is it going to be a big braiding pu pu platter?
Um...
Charketa and Mitchell, what do you think?
I think it's going in the right direction.
Yeah, I like it.
I'm happy I had Mitchell and charketa with me getting our ideas out there and making sure that it's cohesive.
Well, we kind of started with this idea of maybe the villains on the screen.
Villains?
So it's like villains in fashion and film.
So I, kind of, started with maybe, like, a bit of a Cruella de vil.
So this is where the black and white started.
Mine is the front one here.
I mean, I have to tell you it's extraordinary.
Yeah.
It's all straws?
It's all straws and I'm thinking of, I added these little dashes of black and white stripes to tie it in.
I would never dream that those were straws.
Okay.
That's good.
You really transformed them.
Thank you.
Is this you, Fade?
Yeah, but I'm still trying to keep the straw theme going somehow, to tie it all in.
Okay.
So I was thinking, maybe adding a second row of straws.
I thought, also, maybe, like, ending it with black, like, having this all dangling with black.
Just some movement.
When she walks to have a little, not just like, you know.
Got it.
This is all going to be covered in white.
This is just for the underneath.
What is that white?
The scripts.
Oh, you're using the scripts?
Yeah.
So it, I'm going to play around and, like, drape these, and it's going to come up to create a higher collar to give that villain effect.
And then I wanted to incorporate these, like, flower textures on the bottom.
I don't understand the flowers at all.
I just think the flowers are, what?
The thing is, okay, i didn't really originally want to do this villain thing.
I wanted to play with textures.
But if there are two looks that offer cohesion and one look that's a "what,"
then that's not gonna be good for the team.
Yeah, you're right.
Angela seems to be unable to incorporate a different thought into her design and make it work as a collection.
I hope it will not bring us down as a group.
Just keep talking to each other.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Thank you.
Carry on.
Okay.
Angela, I feel like her confidence is really low right now.
I mean, that poor girl is broken.
We saw these movie reels and we just went for them.
So as a team we've decided we'll have a little futuristic look.
Okay.
So I'm doing an asymmetrical top where I'll do a little exaggerated shoulder with the movie reels.
But then I'm doing a skirt and keep my skirt a little basic and wearable.
Hernan, Carrie, how are you feeling about what Sandhya's doing?
We talk about already a couple of things.
Earlier.
Earlier.
To the idea that everybody has to be the same.
The question I always have when I look for cohesion is, "would the same customer wear it?" Well, I think if we get a chance to explain our designs a little differently, maybe-- no, I'm giving you the chance;
Explain.
It's for a futuristic feel, like, we all really love.
Well, for me, right now, it feels costumey.
I'm doing--by using all this film.
I'm making a very kind of sexy and very kind of futuristic piece.
I'm not hearing "team" in any of this.
I'm hearing three individual designers who happen to be together, and they're doing their own thing.
And that's exactly how this looks.
Can I be honest?
Just what I see now?
No cohesion.
Right.
A team's gonna be on the bottom, and a designer from that team is going to go home.
And it's not going to be Sandhya.
Yeah.
That's right.
I'm feeling very, like--very down.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
The way things look to me right now, Hernan, Carrie, one of you will be packing your bags tomorrow.
And I don't want that to happen.
So how are you all?
The first thing that we saw when we saw everything was kind of bright colors.
Like futuristic, but-- futuristic but from the '60s.
Oh, that's great.
So I'm going to do the dress.
It's going to be covered in the tape and the film.
This is actually the back of a jacket.
Oh.
You're doing a jacket too?
Yeah.
Are you biting off too much?
Amanda, Kristine, what are your thoughts?
Looking at the time now, I feel the same way about everyone.
I think we're all-- you do?
I think we need to narrow it down to one piece.
Right.
I was gonna do the whole dress in cording.
That's not gonna happen.
My usual aesthetic is more flattering for all body types, just because I struggle with that, but I feel let's push it forward and show them really what more I can do.
Maybe I can just make this into just more of a shift and then have the lettering, because I love the lettering.
I do too.
So Amanda, you're using the letters too?
Yes.
I want to keep filling it in as much as I can.
Do it in a way that doesn't over commit you to one section, because then you're safe time-wise.
Right.
I know we're taking a huge, huge risk by spending all this time and energy creating our own textiles, but I really have a feeling that, if we can pull it off, the judges will appreciate
it.
Well, design teams, this was a very wonderful session.
I'm incredibly excited about what you're doing.
Your models will be in in an hour.
You will have until 10:30 tonight.
I will see you in the morning.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
We should incorporate like some kind of black.
Oh, how about that?
Shut up.
I definitely think coming from
New Zealand shapes my aesthetics coming from a country where you're so far away from the main fashion capitals, maybe it's a pure way of thinking.
Look, it's the perfect length.
Use the gold here.
Gold?
Gold.
You also going to use-- I have gold in my skirt.
That top, it doesn't work.
We don't have more time to mess around so I decide for the team what are we going to do.
Baby, I told you so many times, that doesn't work.
I told you, like, four times already, and you are safe, you know?
Cornering me and saying all that to me, will not help you.
What will help us is--
I mean, listen to me.
Listen to me.
I mean it doesn't work and she can do something right now, but you have to follow with what are we doing right now.
Okay.
I feel bad because there is no respect for a team member's voice.
We got this.
It's gonna be okay.
Sandhya, are you all right?
I'm fine.
I don't want to cry.
I know.
It's all right.
I feel so bad.
I'm stronger than this.
I know you are.
It's fine.
I'm trying to, like, listen because Sandhya was getting upset, because I wanted to know why she was upset.
I'm, like, standing by the door and I hear him yelling.
He just humiliated her.
I mean, that is a very good critique.
I mean, she is safe.
I know, but she's not gonna do, though?
She doesn't seem like she would sabotage them?
No.
I mean, yeah.
Just because she's safe, she's not going to, and I think that's why she's getting upset, is because she doesn't want to be seen that way.
That makes sense.
Come here.
Come here.
Just give me a hug.
You got this.
Calm down.
You'll get through it, okay?
I didn't realize so early in the competition people are going to be so nasty, so I asked Tim if he could sit with me in the designers' lounge to talk.
So what would you like to talk about?
I wanted to ask about, in the previous challenge, I know the construction was bad, but what feedback did you have?
Did you really feel it was?
I mean, you won.
What am I saying?
You won the whole challenge.
Why are you concerned?
I'm being picked on really bad.
Oh, dear.
I don't want to cry.
I want to tell my stories in a way in a way that I believe in, so I just wanted your feedback because you have such good experience, such great expertise.
So I just wanted to know what you felt.
Well, I believe in your work 1,000%.
Incredibly proud of what you've achieved, and I'm so excited to have you here because you have such a strong voice as a designer.
You could win this entire season.
You make me so humble.
Oh, please.
After talking to Tim, I feel really confident.
His support and his kindness gives me strength.
Oh, yes.
Better.
Yep.
All right.
Love that.
A lot of my designs are inspired by my background.
I'm part American Indian so it's kind of ingrained in just my visual memory of growing up in the powwow circuit.
It's always kind of present in my work.
What now, Angela?
What?
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
What's up?
You come in here always looking worried.
How are you looking for a time;
Are you going to have something to put on a model?
Yeah.
I mean, I already have something to put on a model.
Angela still has only a basic form.
It's worrying, but I can't do anything to help her.
Guys, I want you guys to do this too.
You know?
I'm doing that.
Using that too.
I'm just copying essentially to start off with so there's something cohesive.
Yeah, it looks very nice.
Thanks.
I'll just do this technique as well.
Okay.
If they think in their technique we will get cohesion, then let me go with it.
How many lines are we doing?
I'm doing five at a time, and then I plan on stacking the five.
Okay.
They thought I couldn't be sophisticated, so I wanted to show then that I could be sophisticated.
My team loves it.
It's not going to go over, I don't think.
I think I might have just tightened it a little bit too much.
Okay.
Just let me.
I don't want to rip it when I take this off.
Yeah.
Oh.
You know?
Okay.
My garment looks amazing.
I'm pleasantly surprised in
Fade's as well.
Angela's dress doesn't even fit the model.
I'm gonna cut this.
Okay.
And add a piece with snaps.
Okay.
I just have to pray that she figures out a way to make it work.
It actually fits you, like, really perfectly, so that's good.
Listen, listen.
You know what is the concept is?
The gold era of Hollywood.
We have film.
We have gold.
And we have everything, okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yes.
That's it.
You know, all the best ideas happen in the last minute.
Okay, let me make some marks because I'm gonna have to add a lot more on the side, just because I don't want side boob.
Kristine and Amanda's looks appear to be floating objects around the model and neither of them constructed a base dress at this point.
So there's gonna be a whole lot of nippy slippies on the runway tomorrow if that's not fixed.
Amanda, you're quiet.
Are you okay?
I'm just trying to figure out now to not make it the worst.
It's just rough.
I'm a little worried because we're all a little uncertain of how to finish or if we're going in the right direction.
Maybe you just need to see something underneath.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Blah.
Five minutes more.
At this point I am worried about Angela.
Hopefully we find a way to make it a cohesive collection.
All right, guys.
It's time to head out.
Oh.
C dum, dum, dum, da.
Runway day do you need those little blue ones?
No, please take them.
Here you go.
There was some tension between Sandhya and I, but I'm feeling a lot better and she's feeling a lot better, and I think that's gonna help our attitude to finishing our garment and not being on the bottom.
Quick question.
Tell me.
Should I do the fringe at the bottom?
Should I do that right now?
I think it would be a good time.
Okay.
Sean used straws, and it looks like real fabric.
Like you can buy them by the roll.
I love Sean's look.
Good morning design teams.
Good morning.
How is everybody?
Awesome.
Yeah?
Excellent.
Your models will be coming in shortly.
You will have two hours to send them to the Philip b.
Hair studio and the Mary Kay color design studio.
The Aldo styling wall is to my right.
You, of course, will all be using it.
And I want to tell you something.
Looking around this room, there is some spectacular work.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Keep it up, everyone.
Your models will be in soon, and i will be back later.
Thank you.
No [Bleep].
My hands are, like, shaking today.
It's that kind of day.
Because we're nervous.
Because we're nervous.
Did we come in at eight?
I'm hoping for today that
Sean and I will be able to incorporate Angela's design.
It is very apparent now that it will be an issue, and we're trying to think of ways to make it cohesive.
Do you want me to cut anything for you?
Like, cut more of these shapes?
I don't know.
I don't think you'll match.
It's not that you're doing bad, it's just-- no, I just don't know what you've been doing-- it's one person's hand, you know?
You can't do it.
Like, you know what I mean?
It's fine.
Angela ends up cutting paper and kind of trickles it and I'm like, ohmy God.
Compared to Sean and Fade's look, it's kind of pulling them down.
Hey, girlie.
Hey.
Hi.
What's up?
Nothing.
Just let me know if I poke you.
I will scream.
[Laughter]
Hello.
Welcome to the Philip b.
Salon.
How are you?
We want, like, a square head.
Straight from here and then flat on the top.
We'll take these panels.
We'll slick them back really, really tight and gel them.
So we can just straighten it out and make it look really neat and clean.
Okay.
Sounds good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What if we did, like a gel and then a wave pump?
As long as they're all the same from the front.
Right.
Okay, we'll gauge it according to the model.
Hello, team.
Hi.
Slight cat eye, peachy cheeks and then a soft pink lip.
The color of tickets.
Okay.
I'm excited.
We're going for a smokey eye.
Okay.
It's an avant-garde challenge.
Right.
So maybe we go a little geometric with them?
I think I'm actually on the softer side.
Okay.
I heard you when you talked to her.
You want to be a little bit edgy, and not just show like the usual smoky eye, so I wouldn't get too soft.
And that would be for all three.
Did you do smoky eye, but not soft?
Not geometric?
It's like, come on, you haven't finished your garment.
You cannot be fussy about what your makeup's gonna look like.
You're lucky that we did this for you.
[Bleep].
You're adding the crystals here?
Yes.
This is awesome.
Good job.
We're pretty much finished.
So I'm just doing final touches.
We're feeling good.
I love it.
They have a super Barbie prom thing going on.
I just don't even know how to judge them.
Ooh!
You'll be strapped in a little better.
I know it's kind of hanging.
Just wondering if this should be shorter too.
Kristine, Korina, and Amanda's collection belongs in the bottom.
I don't get it.
No, maybe it's okay.
I just don't have any words for them.
We'll see if they appreciate the risk.
Do you feel like it's too loose now?
Emily's look is really weird, but it is still really fun.
I love her look.
Oh, it's so scary underneath there.
I'm really confident.
Me too.
You look very coin, conf...
What is that word?
Cohesive.
Cohesive.
The first few challenges are the time to show exactly who you are and exactly what you came here to do.
So I'm not really sure what Carrie and Sandhya have come here to say.
It's just following Hernan.
Designers, in ten minutes you and your models and I are going down to the runway, all right?
I'll be back.
Hernan, I just called ten minutes.
Yeah.
You going to be finished?
Yeah, it's already finished.
All right.
And you are such a trouper.
You're always willing to walk around half naked.
Thank you very much.
I am definitely looking forward to the runway.
I feel like I made a very beautiful dress and I hope the judges acknowledge that as an individual within the team.
It feels good, yeah?
I'm feeling nervous.
I'm just hoping nothing falls off on the runway.
Turn it out, girl.
I'm hoping the judges will see our point of view, but I am worried about Angela's look.
Yeah.
That's good.
Mine is the best and the other models should be scared because it's sharp.
If they get too close, they might get cut.
Uh, uh, uh.
Where's my thread?
Where's my thread?
I just hope it doesn't fall apart or anything.
I think it's a very cohesive collection, but they all do look like the same garment.
I'll do whatever you need me to do.
Just don't move.
You walk down the runway.
Thank you.
I feel pretty good about the three looks together, but I'm worried that we're a little rough around the edges.
My brain is fried.
Design teams and models, we are going down to the runway.
Let's go, everyone.
Let's go, girl.
Let's go.
Fantastic.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

Hello, designers.
Welcome to the runway.
As you know, in fashion, one day you're in, and the next day you're out.
There are 15 of you here, and after tonight there will be 14.
We sent you on a movie date, but that didn't last very long now, did it?
No.
Because Tim Gunn interrupted your movie to tell you about your next challenge-- an unconventional materials team challenge.
You were to create a cohesive mini collection using materials related to movie making and movie watching.
One member from the winning team will be the winner, and one member from the losing team will be out.
Sandhya, you have immunity, so you cannot be eliminated today.
Thank you.
The winner of this challenge will have immunity for the next challenge.
All right.
Let's say hello to our judges.
First we have acclaimed fashion designer, Zack Posen.
Hello, designers.
Hi.
Creative director for Marie Claire magazine, Nina Garcia.
Hi, everyone.
And guest judge, top fashion blogger, garance dore.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Hi.
Hi.
We're also very excited to have Tim Gunn here for the runway show.
As you know, he is your mentor and he will not be judging your looks.
He does get one Tim Gunn save during the season, which allows him to bring back an eliminated designer if he disagrees with the judges, which does happen.
Yes, it does.
And we have an anonymous runway show.
We, the judges, will not know which of you designed which look.
Okay, let's start the show.
[Thumping techno music] For how we started and for how bad the team dynamics were, the clothes look well done.
Sparkly.
I'm feeling more hopeful about not being in the bottom.
When the lights hit the film strips on my garment, it is so pretty.
I think that the fact that ours are wearable could work in our favor.
She looks so chic and sophisticated, and the dress fit perfectly.
I'm really glad we used that, you know?
I knew it from the beginning.
I don't think we are going to be in the bottom.
We're going to be safe.
Top team.
I think it's edgy and it's dramatic, but yet so kind of fantasy with a high end taste level.
I think that we, hands down, have this.
It is definitely what I wanted to say.
I loved that we picked the green, and we went graphic.
The back looks so good.
I can't believe we pulled it off.
I love our team's vibe.
'60s, but modern.
We took such a great risk.
It is so cool because it actually looks like you can wear it.
It looks like something that could be bought in a store.
Good job.
Thank you.
I definitely feel that we're gonna be on top for this challenge.
I think that it's really well executed.
It has a lot of movement.
It's really dramatic.
I'm ke, yes, this is what I wanted it to look like, and she looks great in it.
My dress is moving perfectly.
It's tempting the light the way that I was dreaming it would.
Alexander, that looks amazing.
Out of everyone's looks, my team looked the most cohesive.
Everything is spot on.
I think this look represents me as a designer.
It's got that delicate touch.
It's gorgeous.
Given the situation that I had to collaborate, I am happy with the look.
Watch out.
Fade showed up.
I'm hoping it doesn't look too stiff, and I think I pulled it off with the film strips on the bottom.
Good job.
It commands attention.
You cannot tell that it is straws and it's intriguing.
I feel like we created a strong, cohesive collection.
Nobody has anything else like it.
The light hits my dress, it's a breathtaking moment.
If I had to pick a favorite piece in my entire history of making clothes, the discs dress.
I'm thinking, all the trouble I went through getting these tickets to work and it turned out amazing.
The fit on the model is good.
I'm loving it.
Love it.
I'm like, boom.
It's there.
It's perfect.
Seeing the looks, we're super excited, and we're thinking we got this.
Designers, what a fun and fabulous fashion show.
Really.
Congratulations.
There will be a winning team and a losing team.
One member from the winning team will be the winner, and one member from the losing team will be out.
Before we move forward, I just want to say something.
Sean and Fade, we really loved your looks.
Angela, we did not like your look, and that brought your whole team down.
If yours would have been up to snuff, you could have been in the winning team.
Okay, if I call your name, please step forward.
Carrie, Sandhya, Hernan, please step forward.
Kristine, Amanda, Korina, please step forward.
If I have not called your name, congratulations, your scores have qualified you to move on to the next round.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you.
Hmm.
I just think they kind of hate me and hate what I do.
I thought I at least redeemed myself in showing my delicate touch.
Don't beat yourself up.
Yeah, don't.
No.
Don't.
I can see you doing it right now;
Please don't.
Yeah, let it go.
I am safe, but still it didn't feel so good to be the only one picked on.
Sucks.
The six of you represent the teams with the highest and the lowest scores.
Kristine, Amanda, and Korina, your team has the higher scores.
Yes.
Congratulations, you're the winning team.
That's awesome.
That means, Hernan, Sandhya, and Carrie, you have the lower scores.
We're going to talk to the team with the higher scores first, and we're gonna bring you back in a little bit.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you.
Hello.
Wow, you guys are already back.
Wow, that was fast.
You guys are bottom?
Yeah.
I don't agree with the decision.
I feel very in shock, and I feel I'm confused.
I thought ours was at least interesting because we made a cool textured textile, and we made something wearable.
Actually thought, maybe my team will be on the top.
So it's between you two.
I don't think Hernan or I should be going home.
I don't think that we're the right choices.
Kristine, Amanda, and Korina, tell us about your mini collection.
We started talking about movies.
She mentioned 2001:
A space odyssey.
She mentioned fifth element.
I mentioned barbarella, and we just thought, "oh, my gosh.
We're totally in the same vein." And I think that kept us on track.
We kind of gravitated towards space age, but bringing it forward and, kind of, melding it with bright vibrant colors, but also mixing it with, like, the classics, black, white, and neutrals.
Our communication was really good throughout the entire thing.
I think that's why it was successful.
What are the materials in the movie theater that you used to make this happen?
So I'll talk about mine on Alexandria.
It's all duct tape, masking tape, vhs tape and also, this lettering is what's making the front of her bodice.
Oh.
Amanda, what did you use?
Everything ever created.
A lot of zip line, a lot of cording, tons of speaker wire, nuts and bolts.
Those straws are the kind of traditional red and white striped straws, but I just put black tape over the red.
For my look, for the outer part, it's cording, and then for the bottom half of the dress, it's the marquee letters, and then underneath it's cellophane, and then also duct tape as well
for some cleaner lines.
This was great.
I mean, you're using text and font.
Something that immediately says movie kiosk, but you've taken it, you know, into a new place and you used transparency in a really interesting way.
You treat something really cool.
Thank you.
I'm gonna expect really big things from you now.
Oh, goodness.
Your collection felt like the most original.
It is cohesive.
We have three completely different dresses, but they look like they belong in the same fashion show.
It's really, really special.
My favorite is the middle one.
It is so unusual, but also the other two dresses are stunning too.
I think you did a fantastic job.
Thank you.
The most exciting part of this is the color.
Because right there you notice them.
What I also appreciate is that you gave me three different shapes.
You have an a-line.
You have a flapper and then there's this body-con silhouette.
I could see Heidi wearing that.
So yeah, they look like they're together, but they're very different.
I think it was very stunning when the second dress started walking on the catwalk because the letters float, so I thought it was very smart because you really create an effect, you know, like, people are like,
"whoa, what is that?" And, yeah.
The green really takes the collection all together.
I want to see them very close, and I still can't believe you did that all in one day.
You can tell that you guys vibed nicely together, I think.
Yeah.
Really easy to work with each other.
We kind of just vibed off of each other's ideas.
There's no, like, stepping over one another, and we're very open to each other.
Kristine, one person in your team will be the winner.
Who do you think that is?
I would say Amanda.
She took on a ton of different elements and made it look fashion forward, without making it look like elements that you found at the movie set.
What do you think, Amanda?
We all worked just as hard as anyone else.
And so you guys should pick whatever dress was your favorite.
Korina, what about you?
Again, it's about which dress I think you guys had the biggest response to and that was obviously Amanda's dress, so I would say Amanda.
Okay.
We've heard what you had to say.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you, girls.
Hi, guys.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
What'd they say?
Whew!
So what happened?
They loved the color.
They thought it was cohesive without everything looking the same.
And that everything was made out of different material.
That kind of gives you a glimpse into what they didn't like about the other collection, then, because it was all the same material.
They were almost all the same silhouette.
Oh, yeah.
So tell us about your mini collection.
We tried to interpretate the golden age of Hollywood, but very literate.
I mean, like, we used the gold and the film to represent that era.
At no point someone thought, "dude, they all look the same?"
They looked like three identical dresses.
These are different looks than what we started with and all our designs were as different as you saw everyone else's, but when we had our critique with Tim, it was very scary because it was hard for him to imagine the cohesion, so
we just decided to regroup and think about, the main priority is cohesion at this point.
I mean, we're complex designers, so maybe that's what clashed, but other than that-- right.
But this doesn't look complex.
I mean the shapes are, like, a mess.
Okay.
That's rough.
Well, the pieces are rough.
To me they look like three girls out of a music video.
It doesn't look like a fashion show.
Hmm.
That's interesting.
So, for us, obviously, now we have to see which one is the worst one here, taking yours out because you're not in the running anymore.
I feel like the one on the right, which is yours, Hernan, at least it is a bit more fashion with the piece around the neck, you know, the bustier top, even though it doesn't fit
great.
This is definitely not all I can do.
Definitely.
I mean, given if we had 10 1/2 hours from the beginning--
I mean, you all had the same time.
Sure, sure, but if we didn't have to start over, is what I'm saying, I'm sure it would have been different, but--
I still don't understand why you guys had to start over.
When Tim come, he was like, whoosh!
We have the utmost respect for Tim.
He just reminded us about cohesion, and we listened to him, and we thought maybe he has a point here, you know?
Of course.
He came in.
He saw what you guys did and said, "where's the cohesion?"
And what you did, you make three of the same dresses, and that's what we have in front us right now, unfortunately.
If any other team had as bad of a critique as we had, I don't think they would have pulled this out, what we did.
I agree.
We did this in the last four hours.
Stop.
No more excuses.
We're looking at what we have in front of us.
It's fine.
Sandhya, you are very lucky that you are immune because yours is the worst out of all three.
It's awful.
It looks sloppy.
It looks ugly.
It just looks bad and it brings your other two down.
How do you really feel about it, Nina?
I just--I am angry because I do think that we expect a lot from you, and you won the last episode.
You know what, also.
What I love about this challenge is that the designers manipulate the materials.
You guys just put the film roll on it.
It looks like the editing room floor.
I think it was way too literal.
Like, why try to go glamorous with such a material that doesn't move with the body?
Like it doesn't work together, and I think that's one of the mistakes.
We totally had movement, too, in the other one.
I had a train.
She had, like, a circle skirt.
I'm so sorry it's not here, but this is what came out of the oven.
Sandhya, who do you think should go home on your team today, because it's not you?
Honestly, both of them tried their best, but we just lost our way.
I'm a believer in both of them and myself.
Carrie?
I don't think Hernan or I should be going home at all.
Who do you think should go home?
Not us because-- who?
Can I say it?
Yeah.
I'm completely disappointing about the group that win in the group.
I agree.
We thought ours was, in comparison, other than the fact that the materials are very similar, we thought it was at least more sophisticated.
We thought sophistication versus something that looks d.I.Y. Was more fashion.
Well, you feel so strongly, who do you think from the other team should have gone home then?
For example, Angela, I don't want to point it-- well, you just did.
But I don't see why we need to explain our decision to them.
You asked what are we think, and we tell you what do you think.
It's our becoming also opinion.
I strongly feel it is the wrong decision.
I have so much to show you guys.
Like, it's stupid.
I don't see you and I, we two go home.
I hear what you say.
Unfortunately, you guys are the losing team.
We're gonna take a closer look at your outfits, and we do have to pick a loser today.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What do you guys know?
Nina Garcia says it's
Sandhya.
They were kind of disappointing on her because they know she can have a lot of potential more, and she can create something much better.
She say that Sandhya look make our team come more down because she was the worst of the three.
They wouldn't have picked
Hernan or I, is all I'll say.
I'm just sitting and thinking that I will not talk against my team.
I will not stoop down to their levels and put them down.
I will just try and be calm and take the fall as respectfully as
I can.
I just really hope they don't eliminate both of us.
Whatever they decided it's whatever, you know?
I'm not ready to go home.
It's absolutely not my time.
Hi, Tim.
What a challenge.
I can't wait to hear.
Thank God for Tim.
May we begin with the team on the bottom?
Yes.
Please.
I call this team dysfunction.
When I came in this morning,
I was flabbergasted that they would execute the same film treatment in all three looks.
For me, the first thing I see, it's okay, we get the idea that it's cinema.
You have this film material, the last thing I was expecting to see from young creatives, and that's why I think we picked it as, you know, our least favorite.
It's so disappointing.
At the end of the hour, they just panicked and did an iteration of Hernan's look.
Yes.
But at least he had an idea.
It seems to me that these two did not have an idea and then they scrambled.
Well, he was so intractable that they decided, if you can't beat him, join him, just for the sake of something that's cohesive.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, does he go because he messed up the whole team because he wouldn't budge?
In a way, this collection was really his vision because the two of them had to follow his lead.
So in a subliminal way, he was the inspiration.
Carrie, for me it feels like there's a lot of immaturity.
Also in the way she defends her work.
Yeah.
Well, the truth does come out, and this was a very weak team.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
It's clear.
From the beginning.
It is between Carrie and Hernan.
We can always get rid of both of them.
All right.
The winning looks.
They had in some ways just as many issues.
There just wasn't resolution.
I said to them, "look.
I trust your talents.
I trust your ability to communicate.
Do it!"
And they did it.
They used a lot of unconventional materials.
In new ways.
And they used color.
I do think that it works together.
It makes nice story, and I said before, my favorite is that one.
That's great.
It's great runway effect.
Absolutely.
Definitely.
And you can imagine it many ways, with a pair of jeans.
And that's what I like.
It's very versatile.
They each did a really great job.
They were ambitious.
They worked well together as a team.
And it shows.
Okay?
Good.
Ladies, thank you so much.
Bye.
I made up my mind who was the worst one too.
Me too.
I think we're all clear.
All right.
Let's bring them back out.
Designers, one member from the winning team will be the winner, and from the losing team one or more of you will be out.
Designers, with team challenges, we often see your true colors, and today definitely proved that.
Some of you worked together beautifully.
And some of you crashed.
Korina, Amanda, Kristine, your collection was stunning.
Both as a group and also as individual looks.
Amanda, you are the winner of this challenge.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
I can't believe I won a team challenge.
That was a couple of years coming, so thank you.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations.
That also means you have immunity for the next challenge and cannot be eliminated.
Fantastic.
You are all in.
You can leave the runway.
I can't believe it took me a couple different seasons to finally win a challenge.
And I really can't believe that it was a team challenge.
And it was an unconventional challenge.
That was probably the last one I ever thought I would have won.
Winner?
Yeah.
Ahh!
I never won a challenge,
I always wanted to.
Feels really good.
Good job.
Thanks.
Phew.
Sandhya, as we said.
You are very, very lucky that you have immunity.
You're in.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you.
I will definitely not disappoint you.
Thank you.
Hernan, Carrie, at least one of you will be out.
Carrie...
You're out.
Mm.
Hernan...
You're in.
You can leave the runway.
Thank you, guys.
I think you guys made the wrong choice, but thank you for the experience.
I really appreciate it.
I'm sorry.
Auf wiedersehen.
Good luck to you.
I'm extremely baffled.
I'm astounded.
I'm angry.
I'm frustrated.
This is bull[Bleep].
I'm sorry, but it's bull[Bleep].
That's straight up how I feel.
I'm supposed to be going to fashion week, and, like, no offense, but we know who would have been going home, and that's what I think is unfair.
Because one person wasn't allowed to be eliminated, I didn't get to show myself at all.
That is what I just can't get over.
I can't help but cry.
So whatever, shoot me.
Well, this is a quiet room.
Any words?
She didn't deserve that.
Would you have taken the bullet?
I'm not even thinking right now.
Well, it was going to be one of the two of you.
So, Carrie, I have to send you to the workroom to clean up your space, all right?
It was a pleasure, Tim.
Persevere.
Okay?
I will.
That's what I'm good at.
I'm not ready to go home.
I did really want to win, and I know in my heart I could have.
I'm proud of myself for coming out and doing what I did, but I like to believe everything happens for a reason, so I'll have to figure out what that reason was when I go home.
Next time on Project Runway...
What we want to see is what the future of fashion looks like as filtered through your design aesthetic.
What does the future look like to you?
Really cold and dark.
That's sad.
This looks like she's going ice skating.
Too gimmicky.
Go at it.
Ugh!
Unfortunately, it didn't really work.
Houston, we have a problem.
What is this?
It's weird.
Whatever it is, I don't want wear it now, and I don't want to wear it 20 years from now.
She looks like she's coming from the planet of the apes.
You've gotta step it up, because that is unacceptable.
It's crazy looking. the fashion you've seen on tonight's show.
This film is based on one of France's strangest criminal cases.
Its depiction oi events draws greatly on interviews, and official documents and reports.
Considering it a work of fiction, the filmmakers have called on their imagination to deliver their interpretation of a true story.
Winter 1978
Move it, Jér6me'll be there at 9.
You said you're just friends.
So?
Is that a problem?
Sounds like you got knocked off your feet yesterday.
Something like that.
Guess what, he had Vannier in Economics last year.
Apparently, the exam's the same every year.
He'll give me the questions.
I'll ace it.
He's just sweet-talking you.
Even if he does, you're happy to cheat?
You don't care, you'll pass.
His class is horrible.
I have nightmares about it.
Got any cigarettes?
A few.
We can bum more there.
C'mon, let's go!
Watch out, don't go too fast!
You wanna be there for 9?
You maniac!
NEXT TIME I'LL AIM FOR THE HEART
White Renault 5, license plate, 1890 AZ 62.
Attack on a young woman in Crépy.
Could be the Maxence gunman.
Here we go...
The nut must've got dumped and gone apeshit.
We won't catch him with that philosophy.
How come?
What's philosophy got to do with it?
Damn cold!
Lose the mustache.
Breeding-ground for germs.
My little thigh-tickler?
Dream on, my friend.
Tonton, turn up the heating in here.
My fridge is warmer than this car.
Why this way?
Why not?
On the map, left was quicker.
I map therefore I am?
Without a point of reference, there is no order.
What if maps lie?
Thought of that?
If you don't challenge maps, you'll never challenge anything.
You're on medication, right?
It's better we know now.
That one over there.
Let's take a look.
Looks in good condition.
License plate?
7503 RC 60.
Not on our list, that one.
So how'd it get here?
What do we do?
Call HQ?
And waste a half-hour?
The time it takes them to check the data bank...
We do it and split.
I'm freezing.
We'll say it'd been hot wired.
Okay. guys?
Driver's door is locked.
Blanket!
Throw it!
Get on the ground!
Lie down!
Call it in.
Call it in, Tonton!
Don't touch it.
Well...
He has first degree burns.
I don't have a crystal ball, but it doesn't sound too serious.
Luckily.
I'm going to get a hell of an earful.
I'm shocked.
You don't ask an Auxiliary to take such risks.
It's against the rules to take shortcuts instead of consulting a computer.
You should've called HQ.
Security regulations are not optional extras!
Franck...
Next time you see instructions ignored, take command of the patrol.
You have my permission.
Sir,
This letter is intended to provide details concerning the Renault 18, with license plates 7503 RC 60, which exploded due to the gendarmes' recklessness.
At the wheel of said vehicle, I fired 3 shots at Sonia Favreau on Thursday 13th at midnight.
Using the same vehicle, I missed Alice Jonquet on her moped on Saturday 15th.
Alice knows me, will see me again, but won't make the connection.
Next time, PH aim for the heart.
Not the legs.
Organize your manhunts, watch {he railroads, increase nighttime patrols on rainy nights...
I like working alone.
I despise recklessness.
A 19-year-old girl walking provocatively at night is a target I particularly appreciate.
I am a killer.
As such, I shall kill.
"I despise recklessness.
"A 19-year-old girl walking provocatively at night
"is a target I particularly appreciate.
"I am a killer.
"As such,
"I shall kill."
The Police Department sent me this because it concerns our territory and our wounded colleague.
The cops are focusing on known sex offenders.
You think he's one'!
No idea.
I just hope we haven't got a psycho on our hands, like Barbeault.
We have nothing.
Hazy descriptions, vague recollections...
Our weddings?
It's the Crime Squad's case, but the attacks took place on our territory, so we're working with the Police.
I know you don't like it, but we'll help them set up roadblocks.
Neuhart and Tonton, go see Alice.
Question her, see if she knows anything.
Okay, gentlemen.
Damn cops, always taking the best cases!
One second, Franck.
I have to tell you...
The top brass called.
You'll get a letter but I should warn you, your request for posting overseas has been refused.
It happens.
I know you're disappointed, but I'd rather not lose the best man I have.
Sometimes I'm tired, sir.
A gendarme's life!
Look at them.
Pigs are like rats.
For one you see, there are fifty hiding.
Look at that!
As discreet as open-air patties!
We sit here freezing our nuts off, and they swagger around.
What do you expect?
The Police have priority on this lunatic.
Bastards!
Why can't we investigate?
Seriously, you feel useful here?
We're nothing.
Zilch.
Nobodies.
Let's haul out.
Too right.
As if the guy's out wearing a neon sign!
Let's spook 'em.
Drive by, up close.
Hey.
Piggies!
Wasn't a total waste of time.
Morning, Mr. Neuhart.
Morning, Sophie.
You had a good weekend'!
It was boring.
How can a weekend be boring?
Let me make the coffee.
Same as last time?
You liked it?
Very much.
Same again, then.
Go get dressed, I'll fix breakfast.
Thank you.
How's your brother?
Fine.
Mom wishes he'd write more often.
He's in Provence now.
You'd think the army could keep him close by.
This shirt's lost its buttons.
Should I throw it out?
No, I'll keep it.
I can use it to polish shoes.
Here.
I know you like pop music.
Franck, that's very nice of you.
A woman shouldn't call a man nice.
Even so, it's very nice of you.
Okay, it's nice.
Just a few minutes.
As I said, she has trouble talking.
Please, follow me.
Hello, Alice.
How do you feel?
We want to know if you can describe your attacker for us.
You don't have to talk, just move your head.
You'd seen him before?
What was he like?
Old?
Young?
You remember if he had a mustache?
We need something to go on.
You want us to come back later?
I don't understand...
I promise you, we'll catch him.
Okay?
Get some rest.
Your brother's getting married.
So young?
Not me.
Paul!
He'll tell you when he comes.
When are you going to wed'!
I don't know.
Nobody lined up?
No girlfriend?
No fiancée?
Stop pestering him with that.
Hold on...
Look.
No more lonely nights for these two soulmates
Are you kidding?
No, why?
Leave him alone.
Don't bother looking.
Your laundry girl, Sophie, she's keen on you.
She's not keen on me.
You don't see it, but it's true.
You're so innocent, a woman would have to strip you before you suspect anything.
Damn!
Hey, not till I say so.
Listen!
I say when, okay?
Wait for my command, okay?
We'll go again.
There...
The tip like that, and when I say so, fire.
My turn.
Look what you had in your gut.
Great, empty it all out.
Why march on these?
10 v1'!
-
Pay for what?
Who cares what you pay for, you pay.
Isn't this great here?
It's the real thing.
You suffocate in houses but here...
Let's run some more.
Are you sure?
Puking helped, right?
It did.
It cleaned you out.
- Can you do it?
- No.
You dummy.
You'll have to learn to go faster.
They don't wait in the army.
- Really?
- No way.
You'll get dumped on.
Come on.
Move it.
Aim for the pond and I have to catch you.
Faster, before I kick your ass!
You don't eat them?
I don't eat what'!
The eggs.
You shell them and don't eat them.
No, I don't.
I shell them and don't eat them.
But I pay for them.
Sir?
A half.
Not too much head.
Your half.
No trouble, okay.
Same again.
Not so frothy.
Can you manage that?
With the eggs, that's 9 francs.
We have to wait till Christmas?
In there an hour!
Down in the dumps?
Call Paulina.
All ages and genders.
What are you staring at?
Fuck off, you coon!
Good evening.
May I speak to Paulina, please?
I wanted to see her.
I could be there pretty fast.
Yes, go ahead.
Okay.
Thanks.
Evening.
I'm here to see Paulina.
Was it you I spoke to?
Sorry, I'm a bit early.
Sorry, sir.
Come on in.
Where's Paulina?
Don't worry, my dear sir.
She won't be long.
Don't be so impatient.
She's in the bathroom there.
Can't be disturbed.
Sit down, please.
The film will pass the time.
You want a scotch?
I want to see Paulina.
What's she doing in there?
Are you deaf?
What is Paulina doing?
However often I see it,
I always applaud when she brings him back to life.
I can't help it.
Let's open a bottle of champagne to celebrate.
You're shitting me?
Lying right from the start?
There is no Paulina?
Let go of me, please.
- There is no Paulina!
- I lied to you.
There's nobody in the bathroom, there's no Paulina.
Don't be angry with me.
I was so happy to have someone come to see me.
My first visitor in ages.
You have no idea...
Why is there no Paulina?
You enjoy fucking with me?
Do you?
The Nogenl-sur-Oise killer still unidentified
More infamy from the Killer in the Shadows?
Will Barbeault confess to being the Killer in the Shadows?
Can you wait here a minute, please?
I'll go see if you can come in.
Alright.
I won't be long.
Smells funny.
You never open the windows?
It must be the cat.
I'll introduce you.
This is Tom.
He likes you.
I don't like cats.
How about a drink?
Coming right up.
Franck, not so loud, please.
Mom maybe asleep.
Is it you or your mom who bores into the chairs'?
You have something to celebrate?
You could have offered me...
Honey!
You don't drink usually.
It's a special occasion.
- Franck, anything?
- No, thanks.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Me too, ma'am.
- Sophie talks so much about you.
- I hope so.
Although it depends what she says.
You have no worries on that score.
Sophie tells me you're a gendarme.
And I really should be going.
Do you have to, so soon?
Yes.
I get up at 1:30 tomorrow.
Goodbye, ma'am.
Sorry about my mother barging in.
That's okay.
She's charming.
Sometimes, I'd happily sedate her.
Let's have dinner sometime.
I don't eat dinner.
Really?
Only lunch.
I'm always hungry, but I pile on weight when I eat, so I stay hungry.
Won't you make an exception for me?
If you insist.
I insist.
Chantilly?
Sure, gel in.
Thanks.
I have to hitch because I just failed my test.
For the fourth time.
My name's Melissa.
Paul.
What do you do?
- I'm with the police.
- You're a cop?
You're kidding me?
No.
What are you investigating?
You've heard about the nut shooting random girls?
Shit, you're working on that?
Amazing!
It's just a job.
You'll catch him soon?
Soon.
You know who it is?
We have a list of suspects.
Look.
You carry a gun on you?
Can I see it?
It's against the rules.
I'd love to see it.
Have you ever shot anyone?
Three times.
Is it okay through the forest?
Less traffic.
Sure.
Do you feel safer now?
Feels weird, just holding it.
Want one?
What are you doing?
Going to hurt you.
- Hold on...
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Don't scream.
Please, don't scream.
Don't look at me.
Fear Grips Oise County
He kills girls without touching them.
What's he get out of it?
Maybe he hates women.
Blow a gendarme to bits because you hate women?
Don't expect these loonies to be logical.
He's a perv.
Get me a list of escapees from mental hospitals.
Sure.
You think he's one'!
It's worth a try.
If I catch the sicko, he won't see the asylum again.
Pisses me off.
What?
Chasing these guys like hunting dogs.
You've lost me.
The bastards always call or write in, but we never nail them before the next killing.
You want the cops to beat us to him?
I didn't say that.
Just it's a pain in the ass.
Anyway...
I need a leak.
Who wants to hold it?
- You want to destroy morale?
- What do you mean?
Listen up.
Doing your job pisses you off, fine, but don't demoralize the guys.
I was kidding.
So shut the fuck up.
- Cool down.
- You sap our energy.
We'll collar this guy before the cops but not with you.
I've had my fill of you.
You don't want me as an enemy.
Fuck!
You nutcase!
I prefer rental cars.
I can change whenever I want.
Pull over here, please.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
Thank you, Franck, for the lift.
Sophie, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's the matter?
You don't like me, so let's forget it.
What makes you say that?
Why would you like me?
I'm so boring.
No, it's not that...
I'm just a bit tired.
I'll sleep like a baby.
Babies wake up howling every 2 hours.
So I'll wake up howling every 2 hours.
I'll pick you up one night.
Not from home.
It depresses me.
- After I finish at your house?
- Okay.
Only if you want to.
I want to.
Thanks again.
Fm not seeking to be understood.
My acts are the fruit of a different mindset, engendered by mature reflection.
I am not of unsound mind,
I am perfectly aware and in control of my actions.
I know my acts seem monstrous to a public settled in lethargy.
Hypocrisy, selfishness, indifference, cruelty form an amalgam typical of mankind.
And I hate mankind.
That hatred turned a calm, sensitive individual into an unstoppable monster thirsty for revenge and blood.
I want to destroy and kill at random, until I am killed.
I am free, truly freer than any man can be.
Your police and gendarmes aren't warriors.
I am.
HI kill other girls.
I aim for the heart.
If I hold onto a girl's body,
PH chop it up and sow the bits around cities.
Soon PH unleash he".
Shit!
Morning.
Another attack.
We nearly got him.
Know what?
The cops think he's a gendarme.
Ora cop, but most likely a gendarme.
Could be me, why not!
- Where'd the bastards get that?
- The letters.
One of the cops, Giraud, says a gendarme wrote them.
Our way of describing cars, license plates and so on.
He even asked HQ for access to the schedules of every gendarme, to see if they coincide with the attacks.
Niel was furious he suggested it and refused.
They're scared we'll gel the killer and the glory.
The girl?
In a bad way.
She survived but...
I'd love to go there.
Shitty places.
Shitty food.
Come in.
I just received an artist's impression.
Look...
Take it and go door-to-door.
Then check out gay cruising areas.
The cops think he's a gendarme and a fag, too!
You need your revolver door-to-door?
Who's the prime suspect?
A gendarme.
I'm being careful.
Afternoon, sir.
National Gendarmerie.
Do you recognize this man?
Should I?
Take a good look.
No, sorry.
Never seen him before.
Never?
Afternoon, ma'am.
National Gendarmerie.
Do you recognize this man?
Thank you, goodbye.
No?
Are you sure?
Thank you, goodbye.
I know, you weren't expecting me.
Because of the car.
When I saw a maroon one, I didn't think it was you.
I told you, I prefer rental cars.
That way, I lake my pick.
You're not happy to see me.
You can't come in.
I am in.
I told you, not here.
Leave now.
Leave, please!
Calm down, Sophie.
I wasn't allowed in and now I'm in.
Where are the glasses'!
I don't care if your mother's here.
You need to relax.
Want one?
No, drink yours and leave.
I'll explain tomorrow.
Here's to you, Sophie!
Woman of mystery.
Mr. Neuhart, may I introduce my husband, Olivier?
How do you do?
The gentleman I work for.
I'm watching TV.
That's good.
- You hoped to hide that?
- I don't know.
I wouldn't have played a trick like that on a dog.
It's a rotten trick.
I'm sorry.
That solves everything?
Being sorry?
He was here last time I came'!
I took the risk.
He was in bed, and he sleeps like a dead man.
I am sorry.
I couldn't bear to see you go.
I think I'm in love with you.
I know I love you.
Olivier, he's lost his marbles, right?
Two years ago.
We didn't live here, we had our own place.
One evening, he sat down on the couch and stayed there for 24 hours.
A whole day staring in silence at the wall.
The hospital did tests.
- Paresis.
- Syphilis?
Very advanced.
The doctors said it was too late for him.
Why not have him interned?
We're trying but it's...
It's not easy.
Don't worry, we'll find a solution.
I love you, Franck.
I think you're wonderful.
We could go out one night.
If your mother looks after him.
She often does.
Or we leave him at the movies while we go out.
Have a good evening.
Sophie, it's Franck.
I was asleep.
Look...
Are you...
Are you infected?
Did you get tests when you found out what he had?
You mean, did I catch anything?
it's nice oi you to ask.
Well, did you?
No.
I don't know why, but no.
I did every test you can imagine.
Sorry I woke you, but I had to know.
Where does he sleep?
Olivier?
In the back room, why'?
You don't think...
Just asking, that's all.
Okay, hurry back to bed.
Sleep well, sweetheart.
Have no fear.
Thank God for the ass-bandits!
More women for us.
Look!
Is that a salami he's holding?
Hey, Auzier, don't you have a degree in faggery?
You idiot.
It's like my sister's dog.
I'm sure he's queer.
Jeez, I'm starving.
You're not hungry?
Big Brother calling.
Stolen car at the station.
Bomb unit on the scene.
Go and see if the killer shows up.
There's only 1 car, it'll be him.
You'll be relieved tomorrow morning.
Car 355, copy.
Great, hanging around all night in a parking lot.
What about us?
You go to bed.
See you.
Bunch of jokers.
Fuck, I dozed off!
Don't worry, I didn't touch you.
Damn.
The bomb guys have bailed?
I need my bed.
I bet we're wasting our time.
I feel okay, but if you want, we could take a break, two hours maybe, then come back.
I dreamed you said that.
Shall we do it?
Shit!
I'm screwed.
We have to stage a chase.
What?
You got a better idea'!
No, you're right.
Let's do it.
Quickly, before anyone notices.
Base to Neuhart.
What's going on?
The car is getting away.
He's driving like crazy.
Don't lose sight of him.
I'll cal!
for backup.
Copy that.
He's going too fast for us.
Repeat.
He's at the rail bridge.
Try to stick with him!
Whatever you do, don't lose him.
- Shit!
- Whit?
We've lost sight of him!
You can'!
see the car'?
Where is it?
We've lost him.
Are you receiving me?
I repeat, we've lost sight of the car.
Are you receiving me?
Fantastic, Neuhart!
Gendarmes saw you while you were in radio contact.
There were no other cars.
You have behaved like gangsters.
You bring dishonor on the unit.
If I were you, I'd resign.
In 16 years, I never saw anything like it.
I requested an internal inquiry.
Commander Niel refused, so we don't all look like idiots.
You are very lucky.
From now on, I'll use my private vehicle at night to check on your patrols.
Clear prints.
We'll nail the bastard.
I called to speed things up.
They'll place him in an institute this summer.
And I filed for divorce.
Thank you, Franck.
You've helped me get a grip.
I need a normal, happy life.
I'm sorry I didn't do this earlier.
It can'!
have been easy.
And it was very unselfish of you.
You think you can put up with me?
Of course I can.
I love you.
Really?
You want a slap?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm so hiPPY-
It's no reason to finish the wine.
Sorry.
After my divorce, if I asked you to marry me, would you say yes?
Yes.
Say it again.
Yes, I want you as my wife.
Okay, baby?
Morning.
Can I take a shower?
If you want.
There may not be much hot water.
I'll be quick.
Won't be a second.
Lavender.
Want some?
No, thanks.
It's all-purpose.
Hardly surprising you stink for miles.
How do I look?
I don't like make-up.
It's for hookers.
Come on.
Having regrets?
I don't talk much in the morning.
I won't take it personally, last night...
You were very turned on.
Yeah, sure.
Very turned on.
You love me, don't you?
You're the sweetest, nicest man...
A "nice" man is one with no balls.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Are you angry with me?
Should I be?
You're acting strange.
Did I say...
For Christ's sake!
Stop sobbing and sniveling!
It's disgusting!
I'm not angry, I'm driving you home.
Will I see you tonight?
No, not tonight.
When?
You know what?
Should I drop you here or outside the madhouse?
I won't say I enjoyed it.
- I didn't.
- That's all you have lo say?
Perfect.
Have a good day, sir.
Never remember the bastard's face.
He'd better hope I don't catch him.
Bullshit.
You're phonies, all mouth no action.
You'll slap him, then give him to the cops.
- Want a bet?
- Sure.
Cut that out.
I gave Lacombe my word.
If we find him, don't shoot him!
Is that clear'!
Coming out to play?
Bruno!
You okay?
It's me.
Let's go for a ride.
Up from, it's more fun.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
This is yours now.
What?
Here.
It's yours now.
I'm entrusting the forest to you.
You have to earn it.
It's hard work.
Clean up when people come, destroy any animal traps you come across.
Are you okay?
Don't I look okay?
Here...
What for?
I don't need it.
- I won't be around for a bit.
- How come?
I'm going away to work.
Overseas.
Don't tell the folks.
You didn't see me, okay?
Major Lacombe speaking.
I'm coming with two detectives.
See you in 30 minutes.
Evening.
Hi there, Nono.
- You okay?
- And you?
Good to see you.
We missed you.
- Well?
- Look.
No kidding.
And there.
Does it hurl?
Not much now.
Don't you worry, when we nail him, you can settle scores.
He'll get his head chopped off.
Boys, I have to go.
Detectives Jacob and Giraud are on my back about checking everyone's schedules.
Niel just caved in.
So, Franck and Yves, the usual routine.
Check the IDs of all the faggols cruising the Old Road.
Yes, sir.
Nono, help yourself.
Guys,
I got the full sandwich range.
Ham, cheese and palé.
I'm on a starvation diet.
- You're on a diet?
- Sure.
- Is it working?
- I don't know.
I constantly feel dizzy, so I guess it is.
You get any beers?
Do bears shit in the woods?
Look in the trunk.
I'm cold.
Cold?
You're kidding me?
The warmest January ever.
Even so, I'm cold.
Shit, I am cold to the bone.
You look frozen.
Go that way, will you'!
I want to see the forest.
And show you guys something.
0K3)'-
You can stop right there.
Stop.
The lights.
Kill the lights.
Good, we've got a headwind.
They won't catch our scent.
They come by around 1 o'clock, to drink in the castle moat.
How do you know that?
I come to sleep out here.
You're putting us on?
I bring a sleeping bag, pick a spot under a tree and gaze at the stars.
I see them go past.
Always bang on time?
No, but...
Around 1 o'clock.
They're nocturnal animals.
You're nuts.
They smell anything, up to 300 meters away.
Nono, I hope you got a shower, or we'll never see them.
Look!
See them?
The doe in front is barren.
The barren or sterile doe always leads.
Any danger, and she's killed, it's alright, she's sterile.
Smart, isn't it?
It's crazy.
The buck's a 14-point!
Beautiful!
It's crazy.
Great, I wanted you lo see it.
In winter, herds often lop 30 deer.
30?
Crazy!
Shit!
We've got a call.
To all units, too.
Reception's crap here.
I repeat.
To all units...
Ali patrols to base for a briefing on an anti-Gypsy operation.
Fuck, it's Niel!
Evicting gypsies at 1 a.m.
What a joker!
Is everybody involved?
The whole Company.
Pass me the machine gun.
What's wrong, Franck?
Are you sick?
I haven't fell too good all day.
You're pale.
You've caught a bug.
You okay?
We're the first here.
Carpentier, Nono, get some sleep.
We don't need you.
Neuhart, where are you going with that?
To war?
Leave the artillery in the car.
Move it!
In the main hall.
Thanks.
Sir!
Evening.
Grab him.
- What's going on?
- Cuffs!
What are you doing?
- Hold still.
- Got him?
Hold still, Franck!
Let me go!
Let me go, dammit!
Keep still, will you!
Are those cuffs on?
Let me go!
Get his fingerprints.
- What are you doing, sir?
- Taking your prints.
I haven't done anything.
Are we good?
Let's go!
Take his prints now.
What are you doing, sir?
Neuhart, you know the routine.
Okay, give me your hand.
Sir, I need to know...
What is this?
- What's going on?
- Shut up!
Is I!
you?
The prints on the fake plate are yours.
Every attack was when you were off.
It's you, right?
This is ridiculous.
Why'd I do that?
Sign this for me, Neuhart.
It's your resignation.
This is completely ridiculous.
Where are you taking me?
Where, sir?
What are you doing?
How old are you, Tonton?
I'm going to the gallows or the guillotine.
I won't even live to your age.
You're older than I'll ever be.
It's unfair.
It must be freezing in jail.
How about you unculf me?
For the neighbors.
So they don't see me like that.
What are you doing?
- For the neighbors.
- No way!
It's deserted at this time.
Wait.
Raise your arms.
You'd have shot me?
Between the eyes.
Help me.
Start in there.
Look at that.
Unbelievable!
Group together the weapons.
Showing one Beretta 9mm.
Is it yours?
This is stupid.
Showing one Astra revolver.
Is it yours?
No.
Gunpowder.
Neuhart, is it yours?
Lacombe...
Showing 12-bore shotgun cartridges.
No way are they coming up.
It's not a police matter.
This stays with the Gendarmerie.
Sir, can I have a word?
I'll tell you, only you.
Yes, it's me.
You're a disgrace to the Gendarmerie.
Showing one diving knife.
Is it yours?
This registration certificate?
At his trial, Franck Neuhart was judged irresponsible for his acts.
He has been kept in psychiatric care ever since.
Sophie, whose story has been freely depicted, was devastated to discover the true face of the man she thought she knew.

Winter 1978
Move it, Jérome'll be there at 9.
You said you're just friends.
So?
Is that a problem?
Sounds like you got knocked off your feet yesterday.
Something like that.
Guess what, he had Vannier in Economics last year.
Apparently, the exam's the same every year.
He'll give me the questions.
I'll ace it.
He's just sweet-talking you.
Even if he does, you're happy to cheat?
You don't care, you'll pass.
His class is horrible.
I have nightmares about it.
Got any cigarettes?
A few.
We can bum more there.
C'mon, let's go!
Watch out, don't go too fast!
You wanna be there for 9?
You maniac!
NEXT TIME I'LL AIM FOR THE HEART
White Renault 5, license plate, 1890 AZ 62.
Attack on a young woman in Crépy.
Could be the Maxence gunman.
Here we go...
The nut must've got dumped and gone apeshit.
We won't catch him with that philosophy.
How come?
What's philosophy got to do with it?
Damn cold!
Lose the mustache.
Breeding-ground for germs.
- My little thigh-tickler?
- Dream on, my friend.
Tonton, turn up the heating in here.
My fridge is warmer than this car.
- Why this way?
- Why not?
On the map, left was quicker.
I map therefore I am?
Without a point of reference, there is no order.
What if maps lie?
Thought of that?
If you don't challenge maps, you'll never challenge anything.
You're on medication, right?
It's better we know now.
That one over there.
Let's take a look.
Looks in good condition.
License plate?
7503 RC 60.
Not on our list, that one.
So how'd it get here?
What do we do?
Call HQ?
And waste a half-hour?
The time it takes them to check the data bank...
We do it and split.
I'm freezing.
We'll say it'd been hot wired.
Okay, guys?
Driver's door is locked.
Blanket!
Throw it!
Get on the ground!
Lie down!
Call it in.
Call it in, Tonton!
Don't touch it.
Well...
He has first degree burns.
I don't have a crystal ball, but it doesn't sound too serious.
Luckily.
I'm going to get a hell of an earful.
I'm shocked.
You don't ask an Auxiliary to take such risks.
It's against the rules to take shortcuts instead of consulting a computer.
You should've called HQ.
Security regulations are not optional extras!
Franck...
Next time you see instructions ignored, take command of the patrol.
You have my permission.
Sir,
This letter is intended to provide details concerning the Renault 18, with license plates 7503 RC 60, which exploded due to the gendarmes' recklessness.
At the wheel of said vehicle, I fired 3 shots at Sonia Favreau on Thursday 13th at midnight.
Using the same vehicle, I missed Alice Jonquet on her moped on Saturday 15th.
Alice knows me, will see me again, but won't make the connection.
Next time, PH aim for the heart.
Not the legs.
Organize your manhunts, watch {he railroads, increase nighttime patrols on rainy nights...
I like working alone.
I despise recklessness.
A 19-year-old girl walking provocatively at night is a target I particularly appreciate.
I am a killer.
As such, I shall kill.
"I despise recklessness.
"A 19-year-old girl walking provocatively at night
"is a target I particularly appreciate.
"I am a killer.
"As such,
"I shall kill."
The Police Department sent me this because it concerns our territory and our wounded colleague.
The cops are focusing on known sex offenders.
- You think he's one?
- No idea.
I just hope we haven't got a psycho on our hands, like Barbeault.
We have nothing.
Hazy descriptions, vague recollections...
Our weddings?
It's the Crime Squad's case, but the attacks took place on our territory, so we're working with the Police.
I know you don't like it, but we'll help them set up roadblocks.
Neuhart and Tonton, go see Alice.
Question her, see if she knows anything.
Okay, gentlemen.
Damn cops, always taking the best cases!
One second, Franck.
I have to tell you...
The top brass called.
You'll get a letter but I should warn you, your request for posting overseas has been refused.
It happens.
I know you're disappointed, but I'd rather not lose the best man I have.
Sometimes I'm tired, sir.
A gendarme's life!
Look at them.
Pigs are like rats.
For one you see, there are fifty hiding.
Look at that!
As discreet as open-air patties!
We sit here freezing our nuts off, and they swagger around.
What do you expect?
The Police have priority on this lunatic.
Bastards!
Why can't we investigate?
Seriously, you feel useful here?
We're nothing.
Zilch.
Nobodies.
Let's haul out.
Too right.
As if the guy's out wearing a neon sign!
Let's spook 'em.
Drive by, up close.
Hey.
Piggies!
Wasn't a total waste of time.
Morning, Mr. Neuhart.
Morning, Sophie.
You had a good weekend?
It was boring.
How can a weekend be boring?
Let me make the coffee.
Same as last time?
You liked it?
- Very much.
- Same again, then.
Go get dressed, I'll fix breakfast.
Thank you.
How's your brother?
Fine.
Mom wishes he'd write more often.
He's in Provence now.
You'd think the army could keep him close by.
This shirt's lost its buttons.
Should I throw it out?
No, I'll keep it.
I can use it to polish shoes.
Here.
I know you like pop music.
Franck, that's very nice of you.
A woman shouldn't call a man nice.
Even so, it's very nice of you.
Okay, it's nice.
- Just a few minutes.
- As I said, she has trouble talking.
Please, follow me.
Hello, Alice.
How do you feel?
We want to know if you can describe your attacker for us.
You don't have to talk, just move your head.
You'd seen him before?
What was he like?
Old?
Young?
You remember if he had a mustache?
We need something to go on.
You want us to come back later?
I don't understand...
I promise you, we'll catch him.
Okay?
Get some rest.
Your brother's getting married.
So young?
Not me.
Paul!
He'll tell you when he comes.
When are you going to wed?
I don't know.
Nobody lined up?
No girlfriend?
No fiancée?
Stop pestering him with that.
Hold on...
Look.
No more lonely nights for these two soulmates
Are you kidding?
No, why?
Leave him alone.
Don't bother looking.
Your laundry girl, Sophie, she's keen on you.
She's not keen on me.
You don't see it, but it's true.
You're so innocent, a woman would have to strip you before you suspect anything.
Damn!
Hey, not till I say so.
Listen!
I say when, okay?
Wait for my command, okay?
We'll go again.
There...
The tip like that, and when I say so, fire.
My turn.
Look what you had in your gut.
Great, empty it all out.
Why march on these?
To pay.
Pay for what?
Who cares what you pay for, you pay.
Isn't this great here?
It's the real thing.
You suffocate in houses but here...
Let's run some more.
Are you sure?
Puking helped, right?
It did.
It cleaned you out.
- Can you do it?
- No.
You dummy.
You'll have to learn to go faster.
They don't wait in the army.
- Really?
- No way.
You'll get dumped on.
Come on.
Move it.
Aim for the pond and I have to catch you.
Faster, before I kick your ass!
You don't eat them?
- I don't eat what?
- The eggs.
You shell them and don't eat them.
No, I don't.
I shell them and don't eat them.
But I pay for them.
Sir?
A half.
Not too much head.
Your half.
No trouble, okay.
Same again.
Not so frothy.
Can you manage that?
With the eggs, that's 9 francs.
We have to wait till Christmas?
In there an hour!
Down in the dumps?
Call Paulina.
All ages and genders.
What are you staring at?
Fuck off, you coon!
Good evening.
May I speak to Paulina, please?
I wanted to see her.
I could be there pretty fast.
Yes, go ahead.
Okay.
Thanks.
Evening.
I'm here to see Paulina.
Was it you I spoke to?
Sorry, I'm a bit early.
Sorry, sir.
Come on in.
Where's Paulina?
Don't worry, my dear sir.
She won't be long.
Don't be so impatient.
She's in the bathroom there.
Can't be disturbed.
Sit down, please.
The film will pass the time.
You want a scotch?
I want to see Paulina.
What's she doing in there?
Are you deaf?
What is Paulina doing?
However often I see it,
I always applaud when she brings him back to life.
I can't help it.
Let's open a bottle of champagne to celebrate.
You're shitting me?
Lying right from the start?
There is no Paulina?
Let go of me, please.
- There is no Paulina!
- I lied to you.
There's nobody in the bathroom, there's no Paulina.
Don't be angry with me.
I was so happy to have someone come to see me.
My first visitor in ages.
You have no idea...
Why is there no Paulina?
You enjoy fucking with me?
Do you?
The Nogent-sur-Oise killer still unidentified
More infamy from the Killer in the Shadows?
Will Barbeault confess to being the Killer in the Shadows?
Can you wait here a minute, please?
I'll go see if you can come in.
Alright.
I won't be long.
Smells funny.
You never open the windows?
It must be the cat.
I'll introduce you.
This is Tom.
He likes you.
I don't like cats.
How about a drink?
Coming right up.
Franck, not so loud, please.
Mom maybe asleep.
Is it you or your mom who bores into the chairs'?
You have something to celebrate?
You could have offered me...
Honey!
You don't drink usually.
It's a special occasion.
- Franck, anything?
- No, thanks.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Me too, ma'am.
- Sophie talks so much about you.
- I hope so.
Although it depends what she says.
You have no worries on that score.
Sophie tells me you're a gendarme.
And I really should be going.
Do you have to, so soon?
Yes.
I get up at 1:30 tomorrow.
Goodbye, ma'am.
Sorry about my mother barging in.
That's okay.
She's charming.
Sometimes, I'd happily sedate her.
Let's have dinner sometime.
- I don't eat dinner.
- Really?
Only lunch.
I'm always hungry, but I pile on weight when I eat, so I stay hungry.
Won't you make an exception for me?
If you insist.
I insist.
- Chantilly?
- Sure, get in.
Thanks.
I have to hitch because I just failed my test.
For the fourth time.
My name's Melissa.
Paul.
What do you do?
- I'm with the police.
- You're a cop?
You're kidding me?
No.
What are you investigating?
You've heard about the nut shooting random girls?
Shit, you're working on that?
Amazing!
It's just a job.
You'll catch him soon?
Soon.
You know who it is?
We have a list of suspects.
Look.
You carry a gun on you?
Can I see it?
It's against the rules.
I'd love to see it.
Have you ever shot anyone?
Three times.
Is it okay through the forest?
Less traffic.
Sure.
Do you feel safer now?
Feels weird, just holding it.
Want one?
What are you doing?
Going to hurt you.
- Hold on...
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Don't scream.
Please, don't scream.
Don't look at me.
Fear Grips Oise County
He kills girls without touching them.
What's he get out of it?
Maybe he hates women.
Blow a gendarme to bits because you hate women?
Don't expect these loonies to be logical.
He's a perv.
Get me a list of escapees from mental hospitals.
Sure.
You think he's one?
It's worth a try.
If I catch the sicko, he won't see the asylum again.
Pisses me off.
What?
Chasing these guys like hunting dogs.
You've lost me.
The bastards always call or write in, but we never nail them before the next killing.
You want the cops to beat us to him?
I didn't say that.
Just it's a pain in the ass.
Anyway...
I need a leak.
Who wants to hold it?
- You want to destroy morale?
- What do you mean?
Listen up.
Doing your job pisses you off, fine, but don't demoralize the guys.
- I was kidding.
- So shut the fuck up.
- Cool down.
- You sap our energy.
We'll collar this guy before the cops but not with you.
I've had my fill of you.
You don't want me as an enemy.
Fuck!
You nutcase!
I prefer rental cars.
I can change whenever I want.
Pull over here, please.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
Thank you, Franck, for the lift.
Sophie, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's the matter?
You don't like me, so let's forget it.
What makes you say that?
Why would you like me?
I'm so boring.
No, it's not that...
I'm just a bit tired.
I'll sleep like a baby.
Babies wake up howling every 2 hours.
So I'll wake up howling every 2 hours.
I'll pick you up one night.
Not from home.
It depresses me.
- After I finish at your house?
- Okay.
Only if you want to.
I want to.
Thanks again.
Im not seeking to be understood.
My acts are the fruit of a different mindset, engendered by mature reflection.
I am not of unsound mind,
I am perfectly aware and in control of my actions.
I know my acts seem monstrous to a public settled in lethargy.
Hypocrisy, selfishness, indifference, cruelty form an amalgam typical of mankind.
And I hate mankind.
That hatred turned a calm, sensitive individual into an unstoppable monster thirsty for revenge and blood.
I want to destroy and kill at random, until I am killed.
I am free, truly freer than any man can be.
Your police and gendarmes aren't warriors.
I am.
I'll kill other girls.
I'll aim for the heart.
If I hold onto a girl's body,
I'll chop it up and spread the bits around cities.
Soon I'll unleash hell.
Shit!
Morning.
Another attack.
We nearly got him.
Know what?
The cops think he's a gendarme.
Ora cop, but most likely a gendarme.
Could be me, why not!
- Where'd the bastards get that?
- The letters.
One of the cops, Giraud, says a gendarme wrote them.
Our way of describing cars, license plates and so on.
He even asked HQ for access to the schedules of every gendarme, to see if they coincide with the attacks.
Niel was furious he suggested it and refused.
They're scared we'll get the killer and the glory.
The girl?
In a bad way.
She survived but...
I'd love to go there.
Shitty places.
Shitty food.
Come in.
I just received an artist's impression.
Look...
Take it and go door-to-door.
Then check out gay cruising areas.
The cops think he's a gendarme and a fag, too!
You need your revolver door-to-door?
Who's the prime suspect?
A gendarme.
I'm being careful.
Afternoon, sir.
National Gendarmerie.
Do you recognize this man?
Should I?
Take a good look.
No, sorry.
Never seen him before.
Never?
Afternoon, ma'am.
National Gendarmerie.
Do you recognize this man?
Thank you, goodbye.
No?
Are you sure?
Thank you, goodbye.
I know, you weren't expecting me.
Because of the car.
When I saw a maroon one, I didn't think it was you.
I told you, I prefer rental cars.
That way, I lake my pick.
You're not happy to see me.
You can't come in.
I am in.
I told you, not here.
Leave now.
Leave, please!
Calm down, Sophie.
I wasn't allowed in and now I'm in.
Where are the glasses?
I don't care if your mother's here.
You need to relax.
Want one?
No, drink yours and leave.
I'll explain tomorrow.
Here's to you, Sophie!
Woman of mystery.
Mr. Neuhart, may I introduce my husband, Olivier?
How do you do?
The gentleman I work for.
I'm watching TV.
That's good.
- You hoped to hide that?
- I don't know.
I wouldn't have played a trick like that on a dog.
It's a rotten trick.
I'm sorry.
That solves everything?
Being sorry?
He was there the last time I came?
I took the risk.
He was in bed, and he sleeps like a dead man.
I am sorry.
I couldn't bear to see you go.
I think I'm in love with you.
I know I love you.
Olivier, he's lost his marbles, right?
Two years ago.
We didn't live here, we had our own place.
One evening, he sat down on the couch and stayed there for 24 hours.
A whole day staring in silence at the wall.
The hospital did tests.
- Paresis.
- Syphilis?
Very advanced.
The doctors said it was too late for him.
Why not have him interned?
We're trying but it's...
It's not easy.
Don't worry, we'll find a solution.
I love you, Franck.
I think you're wonderful.
We could go out one night.
If your mother looks after him.
She often does.
Or we leave him at the movies while we go out.
Have a good evening.
- Sophie, it's Franck.
- I was asleep.
Look...
Are you...
Are you infected?
Did you get tests when you found out what he had?
You mean, did I catch anything?
It's nice oi you to ask.
Well, did you?
No.
I don't know why, but no.
I did every test you can imagine.
Sorry I woke you, but I had to know.
Where does he sleep?
Olivier?
In the back room, why'?
You don't think...
Just asking, that's all.
Okay, hurry back to bed.
Sleep well, sweetheart.
Have no fear.
Thank God for the ass-bandits!
More women for us.
Look!
Is that a salami he's holding?
Hey, Auzier, don't you have a degree in faggery?
You idiot.
It's like my sister's dog.
I'm sure he's queer.
Jeez, I'm starving.
You're not hungry?
Big Brother calling.
Stolen car at the station.
Bomb unit on the scene.
Go and see if the killer shows up.
There's only 1 car, it'll be him.
You'll be relieved tomorrow morning.
Car 355, copy.
Great, hanging around all night in a parking lot.
What about us?
You go to bed.
See you.
Bunch of jokers.
Fuck, I dozed off!
Don't worry, I didn't touch you.
Damn.
The bomb guys have bailed?
I need my bed.
I bet we're wasting our time.
I feel okay, but if you want, we could take a break, two hours maybe, then come back.
I dreamed you said that.
Shall we do it?
Shit!
I'm screwed.
We have to stage a chase.
What?
You got a better idea?
No, you're right.
Let's do it.
Quickly, before anyone notices.
Base to Neuhart.
What's going on?
The car is getting away.
He's driving like crazy.
Don't lose sight of him.
I'll call for backup.
Copy that.
He's going too fast for us.
Repeat.
He's at the rail bridge.
Try to stick with him!
Whatever you do, don't lose him.
- Shit!
- Whit?
We've lost sight of him!
You can't see the car'?
Where is it?
We've lost him.
Are you receiving me?
I repeat, we've lost sight of the car.
Are you receiving me?
Fantastic, Neuhart!
Gendarmes saw you while you were in radio contact.
There were no other cars.
You have behaved like gangsters.
You bring dishonor on the unit.
If I were you, I'd resign.
In 16 years, I never saw anything like it.
I requested an internal inquiry.
Commander Niel refused, so we don't all look like idiots.
You are very lucky.
From now on, I'll use my private vehicle at night to check on your patrols.
Clear prints.
We'll nail the bastard.
I called to speed things up.
They'll place him in an institute this summer.
And I filed for divorce.
Thank you, Franck.
You've helped me get a grip.
I need a normal, happy life.
I'm sorry I didn't do this earlier.
It can't have been easy.
And it was very unselfish of you.
You think you can put up with me?
Of course I can.
I love you.
Really?
You want a slap?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm so happy.
It's no reason to finish the wine.
Sorry.
After my divorce, if I asked you to marry me, would you say yes?
Yes.
Say it again.
Yes, I want you as my wife.
Okay, baby?
Morning.
Can I take a shower?
If you want.
There may not be much hot water.
I'll be quick.
Won't be a second.
- Lavender.
Want some?
- No, thanks.
It's all-purpose.
Hardly surprising you stink for miles.
How do I look?
I don't like make-up.
It's for hookers.
Come on.
Having regrets?
I don't talk much in the morning.
I won't take it personally, last night...
You were very turned on.
Yeah, sure.
Very turned on.
You love me, don't you?
You're the sweetest, nicest man...
A "nice" man is one with no balls.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Are you angry with me?
Should I be?
You're acting strange.
Did I say...
For Christ's sake!
Stop sobbing and sniveling!
It's disgusting!
I'm not angry, I'm driving you home.
Will I see you tonight?
No, not tonight.
When?
You know what?
Should I drop you here or outside the madhouse?
I won't say I enjoyed it.
- I didn't.
- That's all you have to say?
- Perfect.
- Have a good day, sir.
Never remember the bastard's face.
He'd better hope I don't catch him.
Bullshit.
You're phonies, all mouth no action.
You'll slap him, then give him to the cops.
- Want a bet?
- Sure.
Cut that out.
I gave Lacombe my word.
If we find him, don't shoot him!
Is that clear?
Coming out to play?
Bruno!
You okay?
It's me.
Let's go for a ride.
Up from, it's more fun.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
This is yours now.
What?
Here.
It's yours now.
I'm entrusting the forest to you.
You have to earn it.
It's hard work.
Clean up when people come, destroy any animal traps you come across.
Are you okay?
Don't I look okay?
Here...
What for?
I don't need it.
- I won't be around for a bit.
- How come?
I'm going away to work.
Overseas.
Don't tell the folks.
You didn't see me, okay?
Major Lacombe speaking.
I'm coming with two detectives.
See you in 30 minutes.
Evening.
Hi there, Nono.
- You okay?
- And you?
Good to see you.
We missed you.
- Well?
- Look.
No kidding.
And there.
- Does it hurt?
- Not much now.
Don't you worry, when we nail him, you can settle scores.
He'll get his head chopped off.
Boys, I have to go.
Detectives Jacob and Giraud are on my back about checking everyone's schedules.
Niel just caved in.
So, Franck and Yves, the usual routine.
Check the IDs of all the faggots cruising the Old Road.
Yes, sir.
Nono, help yourself.
Guys,
I got the full sandwich range.
Ham, cheese and palé.
I'm on a starvation diet.
- You're on a diet?
- Sure.
- Is it working?
- I don't know.
I constantly feel dizzy, so I guess it is.
You get any beers?
Do bears shit in the woods?
Look in the trunk.
- I'm cold.
- Cold?
You're kidding me?
The warmest January ever.
Even so, I'm cold.
Shit, I am cold to the bone.
You look frozen.
Go that way, will you?
I want to see the forest.
And show you guys something.
Okay.
You can stop right there.
Stop.
The lights.
Kill the lights.
Good, we've got a headwind.
They won't catch our scent.
They come by around 1 o'clock, to drink in the castle moat.
How do you know that?
I come to sleep out here.
You're putting us on?
I bring a sleeping bag, pick a spot under a tree and gaze at the stars.
I see them go past.
Always bang on time?
No, but...
Around 1 o'clock.
They're nocturnal animals.
You're nuts.
They smell anything, up to 300 meters away.
Nono, I hope you got a shower, or we'll never see them.
Look!
See them?
The doe in front is barren.
The barren or sterile doe always leads.
Any danger, and she's killed, it's alright, she's sterile.
Smart, isn't it?
- It's crazy.
- The buck's a 14-point!
Beautiful!
It's crazy.
Great, I wanted you to see it.
In winter, herds often top 30 deer.
30?
Crazy!
Shit!
We've got a call.
To all units, too.
Reception's crap here.
I repeat.
To all units...
Ali patrols to base for a briefing on an anti-Gypsy operation.
Fuck, it's Niel!
Evicting gypsies at 1 a.m.
What a joker!
Is everybody involved?
The whole Company.
Pass me the machine gun.
What's wrong, Franck?
Are you sick?
I haven't felt too good all day.
You're pale.
You've caught a bug.
You okay?
We're the first here.
Carpentier, Nono, get some sleep.
We don't need you.
Neuhart, where are you going with that?
To war?
Leave the artillery in the car.
Move it!
In the main hall.
Thanks.
Sir!
Evening.
Grab him.
- What's going on?
- Cuffs!
What are you doing?
- Hold still.
- Got him?
Hold still, Franck!
Let me go!
Let me go, dammit!
Keep still, will you!
Are those cuffs on?
Let me go!
Get his fingerprints.
- What are you doing, sir?
- Taking your prints.
I haven't done anything.
Are we good?
Let's go!
Take his prints now.
What are you doing, sir?
Neuhart, you know the routine.
Okay, give me your hand.
Sir, I need to know...
What is this?
- What's going on?
- Shut up!
Is it you?
The prints on the fake plate are yours.
Every attack was when you were off.
It's you, right?
This is ridiculous.
Why'd I do that?
Sign this for me, Neuhart.
It's your resignation.
This is completely ridiculous.
Where are you taking me?
Where, sir?
What are you doing?
How old are you, Tonton?
I'm going to the gallows or the guillotine.
I won't even live to your age.
You're older than I'll ever be.
It's unfair.
It must be freezing in jail.
How about you uncuff me?
For the neighbors.
So they don't see me like that.
What are you doing?
- For the neighbors.
- No way!
It's deserted at this time.
Wait.
Raise your arms.
You'd have shot me?
Between the eyes.
Help me.
Start in there.
Look at that.
Unbelievable!
Group together the weapons.
Showing one Beretta 9mm.
Is it yours?
This is stupid.
Showing one Astra revolver.
Is it yours?
No.
Gunpowder.
Neuhart, is it yours?
Lacombe...
Showing 12-bore shotgun cartridges.
No way are they coming up.
It's not a police matter.
This stays with the Gendarmerie.
Sir, can I have a word?
I'll tell you, only you.
Yes, it's me.
You're a disgrace to the Gendarmerie.
Showing one diving knife.
Is it yours?
This registration certificate?
At his trial, Franck Neuhart was judged irresponsible for his acts.
He has been kept in psychiatric care ever since.
Sophie, whose story has been freely depicted, was devastated to discover the true face of the man she thought she knew.

What do you call a good looking Arab?
What the fuck?
Thanks, mate.
Who are we escorting next, habibi?
Put it this way...
It's a pencil-pushing tight-ass prick you would love to punch the fuck out of, the Defense Minister.
Ah, shit!
He's the reason we got no decent fresh food in this place.
He keeps cutting the budget, pretty soon we'll be throwing rocks like your mob!
Ha, ha, ha.
Your last deployment mate.
Going to miss you, Baz.
This place is gonna be damn boring without you!
Ah, you'll find another Arab to take the piss out of, I'm sure!
Yeah, but not a half Arab.
Hold your tongue or I'll stick this rifle up your ass, wanker!
Yeah, you'd like that, hey!
What the fuck is that?
!
- Sir!
Sergeant Smith and I will be your escorts to the U.S. Green Zone this morning, sir.
ETA 20 mikes.
- What?
Ah, it will take us 20 minutes to get to the American base, sir.
Yeah, of course.
What happened to all our Black Hawk helicopters?
Well, sir, ah...
All the Black Hawks are currently down at the moment, well, with all the budget cuts.
You see that flak jacket you're wearing, sir?
Yeah?
It has no armored plating.
A bullet would go straight through that.
It's true, I'm using it as a window shield in my room.
Well, you blokes do realize that there is a recession going on, right?
Yes sir, we understand that.
But with all due respect, it's just hard to do our job when our equipment's falling apart.
What the fuck was that?
!
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that too much, sir.
It was nothing.
What do you fucking mean, "nothing?"
That thing just shat its pants!
Well, sir... due to the budget cuts, the thing that just shat its pants, is the only thing we have to get us where we're going.
Is it safe?
Yes sir, it's safe.
We'll get you back to your recession in one piece.
Might be a good idea to stop cutting the budget, right sir?
- Fuck me...
New flak jackets and helicopters for everyone.
Right on!
About time, you fucking wanker.
Abdallah!
The pride of the Golani Brigade.
Yeah, not yet.
The pricks won't let me back, till I pass my psych test.
That's because you... need to stop head-butting brick walls.
You still taking your meds?
Don't need them.
Shit!
You got to chill out, man.
They are living in Haifa, they are both retired.
Actually, his wife used to babysit me and my brother.
I don't like the look of him.
Have fun looking at a screen and try not to kill anyone.
Fuck you, you goddamn cook!
Hey, I love my job!
What a beautiful day.
What a fucking shit hole!
Damn.
Don't be closing that door there.
How else am I gonna tan this beautiful body of a man, huh?
What?
You heard me.
Good arm there, boy.
Now...
Don't be closing the door.
You hear me?
Welcome!
You must be Ari?
You're one friendly motherfucker, you ever hear that?
This place is a shit fight.
I've never seen a comm's center run so goddamn poorly.
Settle down, Justin Timberlake, that's the way thing's run up here.
You need to get with the program, okay.
Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
Well, I want to talk to the officer in charge, right now.
Well, let me get right on that.
Okay, son?
They told me about you.
You're that snapperhead with no personality.
You listen to me!
I'm a special forces soldier of the Golani Brigade!
You hear me?
Uh-uh, you were!
You're a fucking nobody.
Now you listen up, cocksucker.
Imma be leavin' this shithole tomorrow morning, so I'll be cussing... and uh, drinking and calling you a cocksucker, okay?
Now uh...
You see them three bars...
here, on my beautiful shirt?
That means, I'm Captain...
Officer.
And by the looks of things, you're just a fucking grunt, so...
That means, I... am the officer... in charge.
Impossible.
- Ah...
Uh-uh, the Israeli officer wasn't feeling well, so they sent him home.
So, it's just you and me, motherfucker, until tomorrow morning, okay?
Get your bag, get back in your hooch, get suited and booted right now.
Fuck off!
Ah, this is going to be fun.
Ah look, it's Aunty Samira!
So... how's mom?
She's good, yeah, she's still busy with the café.
Never stop's working.
She's a workaholic, alright.
So when are you leaving the village and heading back home?
Australia?
This is where I belong.
Nice uniform, wanker!
Did your wife iron it for ya?
HabibiBassam!
Still patrolling the border?
I am now in charge of a platoon.
Woohoo, big man!
Pride of the Lebanese Army.
So... tonight...
You come with me.
Where to?
- Kfar Kila.
Why would I want to go there for?
You are Lebanese, Baz, be proud.
Your father fought for this land, yeah?
And?
- You should go...
The girls will be fine here.
Get out and smell the fresh air around here.
Fresh air, huh?
We'll only be gone for a few hours?
- Of course.
I even have a uniform for you.
Uniform?
!
She puts up with your shit?
The wife must always respect and obey the man.
Oh, that's right, I forgot, we're still in the village.
This is how you treat your wife?
In front of our friends?
A real man would treat me like a princess!
Look at Baz, how he treat Jewels.
I'm sorry princess, please forgive me.
You are so beautiful.
She's beautiful, ah, yeah?
I love you.
Later I give you nice massage.
What, are we going on a picnic, mate?
What's the camera for?
- Surveillance.
Does this thing have night vision?
You two love-birds going camping, or what?
Jewels, my cousin!
Maz, the sleaze!
Sleaze?
I like this name!
We go on border patrol of Israel tonight.
Don't worry, I will look after Bassam.
What do you think, babe?
We have fun!
Take me to Australia with you, please, cousin.
I would love to go.
I hear the people there are nice and weather is beautiful.
Ya, Sydney, Melbourne...
Gold Coast, Sea World...
Dreamworld, kangaroo!
You sound like a tourism commercial.
When your English gets a bit better and you come out to Australia,
I'll get you a job in the café.
HabibiBassam!
Thank you.
Take it easy with the hugs, mate.
People will think we're gay.

Over.
Shu, what's up?
I have to head back to the base now.
Some shit job I must do.
What do you want me to do?
Listen, habibi, I'll be gone 40 minutes tops, okay?
All you have to do is walk in this direction until you come across a house with lots of those antennas on the roof.
You're taking the piss, right?
No, I don't need piss now.
When you get there just knock on the door, tell them you're my cousin, give them this.
I don't know a word of Arabic and you're asking me to walk into a Lebanese Army base?
Why do Australians worry about everything?
You're sending me on a tour that has the Israeli soldiers looking at me through their scopes.
Don't worry.
Here, take my pistol, it's an old 9mm.
Just follow the yellow brick road.
You know, from The Wizard of the Oz.
Yeah, thanks Dorothy, dumb-ass.
Dumb-ass?
I like this word.
Gay, dumb-ass.
Very nice words.
You teach me more.
Anyone home?
Ah, Ari!
How many times I gotta tell ya, not to close that goddamn door?
!
Bob, what the fuck are you doing on the floor?
Shut up.
Okay man, okay man.
You speak English?
Just untie me and you can walk free, my friend, okay?
Hey Druze boy...
You hear me, you fucking--!
You fucking hear me?
!
What's your name?
Oh!
Ah, Bob.
And that cock-head over there is named ah...
Ari.
Listen, mate...
I was on my way to grandma's house, and got lost... and ended up here.
So if I'm a guest in your home,
I need you to be nice so we can resolve this little matter.
- Sure my friend...
We can have a cup of tea and watch a little TV.
Huh, what do you think?
Don't be smart.
You're fucking English or Arabic?
Australian Lebanese.
Australian Lebanese, okay, so let me get this right.
You crossed the Lebanese- Israeli border, without anyone seeing you.
You're Australian Lebanese...
You walked into a top secret Israeli communication base, and you've taken two prisoners!
Yeah, that sounds about right.
What the fuck happened, huh?
Work it out, fuck-stick!
We've been captured.
Where the fuck were you, Bob?
!
Uh...
Shu?
No, I was grabbing a beer... and um, I got punched in the face by this... this here nice gentleman with the gun.
Fucking Americans...
Everything is a fucking party, right?
!
What?
- Homecoming!
Miller time.
Well as you can see... we have a crazy Australian Arab with us tonight!
An Aussie?
Hey, you from the penal colony?
!
You're a goddamn criminal, huh?
Jesus, Bob, when God was giving out brains, you clearly thought they were milk shakes!
you make fun of my goddamn middle name one more time, I'll bite off your nose!
What's your name, Arab?
Steady on with that Arab thing.
My name is Baz and I work for nobody, alright?
You know Baz, we have plenty of room for pussies like you in our prisons.
You're in Israel, motherfucker!
No one fucks with us, got it?
!
Shut the fuck up!
Boys please, for the love of God, shut up.
Hey, hey, hey, relax with the guns, guns ain't funs.
What do you say we have a few beers?
You Aussies love a cold one, right?
Yeah?
Gimme a fucking second!
- Sure, sure.
Alright, listen...
Bob...
That sounds good to me.
But no bullshit, alright?
I am no threat to you.
I just walked in the wrong fucking door.
Kind sir, if you would be so nice and go over here and cut my cable tie,
I could get up and get us some beers.
I just don't want to die today or tomorrow.
Alright.
Don't cut off my hand, please.
But not you, Ari.
You have to calm your shit down first!
Who the fuck gave you all the power?
Just because you got a gun, don't you think you're getting out of this situation scott-free.
Hey, steady on mate.
Alright, let's just tone it down a notch.
- Fuck!
Now, I know that your adrenaline is pumping, and the red mist is fucking with your ability to process this situation right now.
But I urge you to calm your shit down.
Piece of shit.
This guy is off the charts.
There you go.
Ari, Ari...
Relax.
Yeah okay, fat man.
Fat man?
I'm not fat.
Hey look...
Let me ask you the same question.
Who gave you all the power?
Who gave me the power?
Who gave me the power?
You're in my country, you American idiot!
Go invade some other weak-ass country!
Get your head out of your ass, and clean the shit from your ears, and hear me soldier.
Because when the shit hits the fan and it gets a little rough out there, all you pussies, and you're all pussies... you call the good ol' U.S. of A. to save your fucking asses.
It's your lucky day!
You can choose two cupcakes, okay?
This one and...
Baby, I'm just gonna go out for some fresh air, okay?
Oh, you mean a cancer stick?
Some people call it that.
I call it fresh air.
You sure?
What about that one?
And this one.
- Mm-hm.
And that one.
How's it goin'?
Jewels baby, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, we're okay.
Oh God, you're hurt!
Listen, stay here and don't move.
Sarah, gimme your mobile phone.
Wait, where are you going?
Get back.
Stay down, stay down.
Somebody please help me!
She was in the bomb blast.
Yes, yes tell me what happened?
Looks like she clipped a femoral artery, hurry.
Hurry!
Where are you from?
What kind of question is that?
Are you Israeli?
What does it matter where I'm from?
An old lady might die, and you're asking where I'm from?
Yes, I want to know where you come from.
Australia, you happy?
!
You look Arabic.
Are you an Arab?
You know an Arab did this.
- I don't know who the fuck did this,
I know an Arab tried to save her life!
- Baz!
Are you ok?
- I'm good.
Where's Lisa?
Uh, she's uh...
You're with this terrorist?
You bastard, he's not a fucking terrorist.
You're married to an Arab?
Fuck you, terrorist!
Fuck you!
So, Baz...
What's your story, huh?
I joined the Australian Army back in '01.
I served in Afghanistan and Iraq as a commando.
I discharged... under a week ago.
I'm visiting my father who lives about five kilometers from here.
How's that working out for you, man?
Not so good, actually, Ari.
Don't mind him.
I was tagging along with my cousin on a night patrol, and I got lost and somehow ended up here.
Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time, huh?
This is retarded!
I am getting the fuck out of here!
Sayonara, dickheads!
Ari, you need to get your head checked.
Bob, good luck, mate.
Get the fuck out of my country!
- I'm fucking trying mate!
You can't leave, Baz!
- Bullshit, Bob!
You locked the front door, which means you locked us all in here for the next six hours.
You're making no sense, sunshine.
It's a time-lock door Baz, for security reasons.
It will automatically open after six hours or a soldier with a code from the outside can get in, see?
See the clock?
- That just makes no fucking sense!
What makes sense in the military, huh?
Well, I don't know?
A fucking key?
Only a patrol with the code number can get in and the key went home with the Israeli officer.
So there you go.
What happens if there's a fire or one of you nutters decides to go all BowlingforColumbine?
Well, asshole, it's our duty to stay locked in.
That's because you're pussies!
Why was the door unlocked in the first place?
'Cause Bob wanted to tan his beautiful body of a man!
That's true, that is true.
But we always leave the door open, I mean... nothing ever happens here.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
We're pretty much fucked, aren't we, right?
When that door opens, I'm firing the first shot.
With any luck, I can make a run for the border.
It's either that or I'm dead.
If you do that...
Israel will attack Lebanon and... anybody else she views as a threat and... boom!
Bomb blast.
Tel Aviv.
Five minutes ago.
Car bomb, fucking car bomb.
Many people are wounded, some are dead.
You want a beer?
It's nice and cold.
You married, Bob?
Boyfriend, girlfriend?
Actually, I... lost my wife five years ago to cancer, so yeah.
I'm sorry to hear that, mate.
- Yeah.
Well that's a fucking shame, Bob.
Things happen.
How about yourself?
I'm married.
- Bob!
Bob!
What?
!
Give me one of those cigarettes.
Can he have a cigarette?
No!
You know what, why don't you paint yourself blue, get inside the ocean, fucking drown, huh?
What does that mean?
- Some Jew thing, I think.
I don't even know what that means.
- Fuck this, fuck this shit!
Fuck this!
I've had enough of this fucking bullshit.
Shoot me.
Come on, you goddamn Arabic dog.
My grandfather killed you Arabs, my dad killed you Arabs,
I'm gonna kill a few more Arabic scum shit like you before I die.
Shoot me!
- Baz, no.
Isn't it great how we can just shoot you fuckers?
Blow your homes up and no one talks about it?
I love it.
The whole world thinks nothing of you.
You give us 20 more years and we'll exterminate you to the very fucking last of you bitches!
You're a tough motherfucker with five or six Army buddies behind you, huh?
But a big fucking pussy, one on one.
Do it, you fucking pussy, come on.
I'm going to fucking kill you.
This is for your grandfather, this is for your father.
Come on, you fucking Israeli psycho!
You fucking pussy!
Sit the fuck down!
Hey, hey, come on, Ari.
Fucking okay.
Fucking let me go, fuck you!
Settle down now.
Come on now.
Here, here, have a drink.
Have a drink.
Why'd you have to hit him so hard for?
Come on, God darn.
- It's okay, kid.
Fuck off!
You know what, Ari?
You're more barbaric than a pit bull in heat.
You are kind of fucked up.
- Shut the fuck up, Bob.
Okay.
Why is the world so scared of you guys?
I mean, you got the whole world shitting in their pants!
You say a thing against a Jew, and the media goes fucking ape-shit with the term anti-Semitic...
The holocausts.
The fucking Jews have been persecuted for thousands of years.
But here you are telling me that you love to kill Arabs.
Now how the fuck does that work?
Yeah, because your Muslim Jihad, that blows themself up in our buses are innocent, right?
No Ari, that's not what I'm saying, all extremists need to have their head read, okay?
The media just makes us look real like shit!
That's true.
Come live in America, say a bad thing about a Jew and they will cut your balls off.
But land in the US as an Arab and get harassed.
Baz, to be fair, you did blow up our twins.
Which was a colossal fuck up.
Now I'm not saying that mistakes haven't been made.
But can you imagine if the Arabs started crying to the world that they have been persecuted?
By the Romans, the Ottomans, the British, the French, Tom, Dick and fucking Dirty Harry?
People would laugh!
Well the media has put bad spin on you people, that's true.
I mean why is it okay for you guys to be put on a pedestal and wrapped in cotton wool?
Fuck you, man!
We have been persecuted.
People all over the world have been persecuted!
Yeah whatever, this is our land so both of you can get the fuck out of here.
Look, what happened to all the Arabs, the Jews, the Christians that were all living together,huh?
I'll tell you what happened.
When the Zionist movement of the world decided it was a good time to take Palestine, they put a gun to their heads and told everyone to fuck off.
You ever heard of the Balfour Declaration?
Yep!
Huh?
The British mandate, the United Nations resolution that states half of the land of Palestine is given to the Arabs which they rejected and the other half is given to the Jews!
What about the massacres, son!
You forget that?
Groups such as the Irgun, Lehi, Haganah?
Haganah took out British authorities, and resident Arabs.
Well you know, shit was happening on both sides, Bob.
That's war.
And the Arabs were no fucking angels either.
In '48, when the British withdrew,
Israel was immediately attacked by the Arab nations.
So I'm very sorry that after 6 million Jews that were slaughtered in the holocaust, we had to defend ourself.
What about that Six-Day War, huh?
What about it?
It was a glorious victory.
Oh come on, that was land grabbing son, land grabbing.
Shit happens.
What about the invasion of Lebanon, mate?
Your PLO buddies started it, we just finished it.
Fuck off, Ari!
What about the 17,000 Lebanese civilians who died in the conflict of '82?
How the fuck do you know so much about Middle East politics, huh?
Well I've been living in the Middle East about 10 years, and I got a degree in political science, which makes me not just a red-neck but a very, very smart red-neck!
Well, you don't have to live with the Palestinians, okay.
Cut the bullshit, son.
'Cause you could say that about any and all nationalities.
You're both full of shit.
I take it you're the man that brought in Miss Rosenberg?
Anna is her name, yes.
You have I.D.?
Passport?
Uh no, it's back at the hotel.
Where are you from?
I was born in Australia.
My father is Lebanese, which makes me Lebanese.
Stand up.
What?
Did you know that?
So why are you arresting him?
- Listen to me.
No, you listen to me.
What if he had saved your mother?
Would him being an Arab matter then?
Ms. Rosenberg wants to see the man who saved her life.
I've had enough of this bullshit, had both of y'all...
enough.
Hey Ari, what do you say you give me a hand cleaning this shit up, okay?
Why don't you go fuck yourself, anti-Semitic pig.
Hey don't put that anti-Semitic shit on me, you new Jew boy.
Come on.
New Jew boy?
- Yeah.
You know Bob, before you judge me and my people, you should take a look at your own history, you hick country bumpkin!
Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
Here we go...
I'm sure you're going to give it to me.
Give it to me.
Yeah well, America was founded on genocide.
You guys are far from being innocent in this argument.
Native Americans, slavery... war-mongering.
You're an Ashkenazi Jew, aren't you?
You're not even a Sephardic Jew!
Answer the question, Ari.
Are you Sephardic or Ashkenazi?
A Jew is a Jew and that's it.
You should be a teacher, a brief lecture and he's already lost me!
The gentleman here is European.
- He's an asshole!
And not a descendant of the people of this region.
He therefore can't claim anti-Semitism!
You see, anyone from this part of the world who originated here is a Semite.
That's me, regardless of what god or practice you follow.
So Ari, by your own definition, you're not a real Jew.
Fuck you Baz, it's like me saying you're not Arabic because you were born in Australia.
All Jews, black, white, Asian, all are Semitic by birthright or conversion.
That shit was made up to protect you guys under one banner.
Yeah, okay.
Yo, Bob!
What do you call us Arabs in your part of the world?
That would be Dune Coon, Sand Nigger, Camel Jockey, and Towel Head, shit like that!
You see that is the true definition of anti-Semitic!
Alright, so Bob, who is the Semite in the room?
!
Well, it ain't Ari 'cos he's some kinda European breed which makes him an Ashkenazi!
You see, it's funny how you people claim to be Semitic, chanting the anti-Semite war cry, when you're not even a proper Semite yourself or even understand the fucking term!
Where do you get your facts from Baz?
No seriously, I want you to tell me.
'Cause I've never heard so much racist bullshit in my whole goddamn life!
Hey, listen you--
Listen, you two monkey ball shavers, come on.
Baz, no, settle down.
Okay?
Fuck me.
You know what the problem is with you people?
Now, you have facts and you have facts.
that a fact is just another dickhead's opinion and that is a fucking fact.
Now, I have something special to calm you two down.
And it isn't a... man's penis, nor is it mine!
Mexican-Cuban bud!
Are you fucking serious?
Yeah...
I don't normally do it on watch, but I feel that we're all gonna be killed tonight, and I want to be high when I catch my round in my head.
So, one for you, go on, one for you, one for me and...
Alright, come on, Ari!
Come with me, we're going some place special and you don't even have to leave the building.
You can't anyway.
Now that's really...
That's, that's some strong weed there.
Bye!
You okay?
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me, I'm worried about you.
Just another day at the office, huh?
It would be nice to get Lisa out of the city.
Hey.
Hey.
Listen, first thing in the morning... we'll get a bus up to Jordan and then... hopefully be in Lebanon by nightfall, huh?
I love you, baby.
I really fucking love you.
When those soldiers come through that door and see me, they're really gonna fuck us all to hell!
Yeah, yeah.
But, but first I'm going to unload a full magazine.
No, 'cause I'm gonna tell them who you really are.
I'm gonna to tell them, he's fucking Australian!
So...
So, Bob.
How did you come to work for the Israelis?
And why are you wearing an Israeli uniform?
Yeah Bob, I was wondering why are you wearing the uniform of a fucking warrior!
Fuck off, Ari!
I spilt some hot dog gravy on my uniform this morning and this is the only piece of shit they had lying around.
You have some respect for this uniform, scum shit.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I do kinda like the color, though!
Kelly green and so pretty!
I joined the military to see the world.
Took a class in Arabic.
My first posting was in Egypt.
Since then I've done tours in Jordan, Lebanon, and the U.A.E.
I've been to Libya, Morocco,
Tunisia, Lebanon, Sacramento and Kansas city.
I've even been to Iran!
Best house parties, hands down.
The best drugs, women!
Fuck man, you seriously should go.
I'm impressed, hillbilly.
Well, we're not all dumb Americans, you should be.
So you're a spy?
You FBI or CIA?
You're high!
I'm a hillbilly!
I'm a Cryptologic Linguist.
Hence my ability to read and write Arabic.
So what you're saying is that you're a redneck nerd?
Basically I just teach them how to use the equipment.
That's why they stuck me here, till tomorrow morning when I leave, if I'm still alive.
Then it's back to my unit in Dubai.
The Las Vegas of the Middle East!
The best hotels, the hottest women, the tallest buildings, but the shittiest drivers in the world, shit.
What the fuck.
You both know you're cut from the same cloth, right?
You're cousins!
- What?
You're monkeys, I mean, you're monkey cousins, you're basically monkeys that are cousins who don't talk no more because your-- it was your uncle that fucked his grandmother in the ass with a hound dog's gorilla's dick!
What the fuck?
!
- I'm just trying to say Arabs and Jews are cousins at the end of the day.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Okay, you stupid people.
You're both circumcised, right?
You eat Kosher, you eat Halal, they're both the same kind of shit.
No.
What?
- It's not.
It's pretty close.
Haredi Jews are like conservative Muslims, strict and crazy.
You make a good point there.
That's it.
Check it out!
Are you one of those Facebook freaks that invites hot chicks to be your friend?
Sand-nigga, please.
Look, I've got a little surprise for you boys, okay?
Yo Bob, if you're going to show us your pee-wee again,
I swear to God I'm going to make a little kebab out of it.
Hey, pee-wee this, smart-ass, okay?
Now there's something you need to know about me, and that is I love to cook!
See, you are gay!
Goddamn it, Baz, listen to me.
I love pussy,
I love my beer, but cooking is my first love.
So what are you going to cook?
Like Jesus, we're going to have our Last Supper!
Big Bob is going to be making his uh, nice piece of beef baby back ribs.
Oh yeah!
And not only that, some mashed potatoes and coleslaw, too.
Yep, and you two little sand- niggas are gonna help me out.
What do we need to do, Hitler?
I need you to peel some potatoes.
Oh man, how long is this gonna take?
This bag of weed will speed things up.
Check it out.
Oof!
Shit, Bob!
Where did you get this magical green from?
Oof!
That boy just marinated the brisket.
Oof!
Bob?
- Huh?
Tell me something...
Um, why are you Americans so stupid and brain washed?
I don't have enough time to explain it, really.
But smoking a joint a day, keeps the terrorists away.
'Cause this stuff is going to bring us world peace, I'm telling you.
Fuck this, I can't smoke anymore.
I'm fucking dead.
- Pussy.
Hey, did you know that America has been involved in 67 wars that we know of?
About 250 actions since World War II?
The American government has been involved in and assisted in the overthrowin' of foreign governments.
Cunts!
We get rid of democracy governments because they don't play our game and put in our dictator puppets.
I don't even like being American at times, shit!
You dicks preach democracy then kick the shit out of some poor country that doesn't play by your rules.
You're in wonderland!
Let's keep you preoccupied with reality shows, a house mortgage, porn, fast food, and propaganda media while the government of the West go and rape a second or third world country for their resources.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Okay, okay, okay...
I'm stoned!
Fuck, I'm stoned like a motherfucker!
So if you were the President of the United States of America, what would you say to the people?
My fellow Americans.
Now I said there would be change, and goddamn it, change has come.
I told you I would go after those crooked... politician Wall Street bankers and I did.
I have pulled our troops from their overseas postings and they're back home where they belong protecting the U.S of A.
and we left all that other bullshit to NATO and the United Nations.
And I will not allow the media to put any more fear into the American people.
Man!
Listen... we are gonna start again from scratch in this country.
We the people come first.
Not the government.
Not the media.
Not the banks.
You the people come first!
I don't care if you're Jewish or Muslim or Christian or African-American or purple or black or gay.
Hell, I don't care.
We have fucked everyone over for so long that the whole world hates us.
I'm tired of being called the dumbest country in the world.
So I'm telling you... to put a smile on your face, and read a book.
Say hi to somebody, be nice.
And um, last of all, I want to say
God bless you, God bless your family, and last of all, God bless...
America, please!
God bless the whole world.
That's what I'd say if I was president.
Bravo, Bob the Builder.
One thing, Mr. President, the Nazis running your immigration department need to go easy on anyone with a slight tan and dark beard.
Including the women.
And the rubber glove thing up the ass, it's just not fair!
Is the food ready yet?
I'm fucking starving.
Twenty minutes.
Hey!
Anyone up for a boxing fight?
Yeah, I like to work up a good sweat before I have a feast.
Come on Ari, you sad-sack of camel balls, fight me.
Let's do this, cock-head.
I mean, Mr. President.
Come on, Jew boy, let's go.
Bob, I'm telling you, this is goddamn stupid.
Imma kick your ass.
- No, this is great!
Beat his ass, Bob!
- I just need one.
All right, here we go, ready?
Bob seriously, I don't want to hurt you.
Oh, Imma beat the shit out of you.
- You boys ready?
Yeah, Let's go.
Come on!
Bob, now this just made me angry, motherfucker!
It looked like a good little hit.
Bob, I'm warning you, man.
Uh...
Yo, Bob!
Bob!
- Bob!
Hey, grub's up, bitches!
Give me a hand.
We're gonna eat like we did in the good old days.
There was a time when the Arabs, the Jews and Christians were all friends and would eat together.
What time is it?
Oh right!
It's Jew-bashing time!
Oh come on, it's just a fact Ari.
Ask the old people, it's all there, you just gotta open your eyes.
Well Bob, the old people are dead now.
All we have left is just... bloodshed and hatred.
I've lost seven mates in action and my cousin was shot by an Israeli soldier.
Does that mean that I have to hate you?
You're not the one who pulled the trigger.
The poor bastard who did, probably didn't want to be there in the first place.
Well, I don't know how to forgive so...
Well, it's hard, mate.
Have some shisha.
My two boys are getting along.
That's good, that's good.
Alright, yalla, man!
Lets eat!
Yalla!
So you guys really fucked yourselves on September 11th, huh?
The new bad boys.
You certainly do look the part, too.
The Russians were the bad-asses in the 70s and 80s, the North Koreans in the 90s.
Tadaa!
We now hold the baton of love, hey?
You Arabs think we did it to ourselves to get your oil, right?
I think it was.
Really?
- Really?
You, Mr. Israel?
I just think you Arabs were too... dumb to execute such a perfect plan.
So Baz, if we're talking here... can you explain to me, why are Arabs so damn backwards?
See, the Middle East has been a fucking bloodbath for thousands of years.
And that includes my Jewish brothers.
The Ottomans took over most of the Middle East from... like the eleventh century, right through to the end of World War I.
So the people have been repressed for a fucking long time.
They have fought for their land, for their freedom, for their individual religions.
Ah, bullshit.
- Ah, no--
After the Great War, everyone had their fucking finger in the pie.
The French, the British, even your crew, Bob.
But you didn't just have your finger in the pie, you put your whole fucking fist in there and your cock!
Not my cock.
When the Brits broke up the British mandate in Palestine, they gave the majority of the land to Jordan and a little bit to Israel.
Real little bit.
- Little bit.
But hey, that's when all the fun began, right?
Well, you bring oil in the picture...
The powers that be just been playing the Arabs against each other, that's all.
Well thank you boys, but... what I really want to ask you, Baz, is... what makes a person blow themselves up?
Well if I was to take a guess, I'd look at it like this...
You take a man's land, you blow his house up, you harass him every single day, turn off his electricity and water, voilà, one suicide bomber!
We pulled out of Gaza back in 2005.
We gave sacrifices man, they get a chance to vote, they get a chance to have their say, but they still choose to blow themselves up!
That's a good point, good point.
All I'm saying is the people in Israel want to live their lives in peace.
And the Israeli people are not the government, they're not the IDF, and they're not Sephardic or Ashkenazi!
They are citizens.
We have people who want war.
You have people who want war.
But I assure you most of the people in Israel are just like everywhere else in the world, we just want peace.
Peace?
Baz, if you think the people in Israel don't want peace,
I'm sorry to say you know nothing about this part of the world.
Look, all I do know is that the Middle East is growing up fast.
Dubai, Abu Dhabi.
Their sheiks care for their people, and the people love their leaders.
The rest of the Middle East needs to take a page out of their book.
They need to steel the book!
Hey!
I-I agree with you.
Yeah...
You do agree.
- It's a shocker, right?
So Bob, you're a connoisseur of the green shit, huh?
I am a high time loyal fan, yeah.
What are you on about anyway, man?
Close your eyes,
I'm about to take you on a tour.
It's called, "Getting-high- with-Bob."
Motherfucker.
- Close my eyes?
Close your eyes, man, it's better when you're high.
It's gonna rock your world.
Ready?
Think I'm fucking with you, boy?
I keep the peace with that green spirit, hippie shit, man.
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so make sure you have your Special J.
Sexy Amsterdam, there's nothing like sucking it through a bong.
This is my man Bob smoking an African black joint.
It's some gooood shit, man!
My good friend, Lebo AK-47.
It's a nice view from the top.
Hey, Mr. Hindu-kush is my best friend!
The Buddha brings peace to one's mind and soul in a crazy city.
Ping-pong, anyone?
That was an awesome trip, man.
You boys up for a li'l Texan fun, huh?
It's called Texan Roulette!
Hey, hey, there are three rules:
One, you got to take a shot of Jack.
Two, you got to talk shit about somebody.
Three, you gotta put this revolver--
Whoa, put the gun down, Bob.
- Whoa, Baz, whoa!
Drop it.
- It ain't loaded.
It ain't loaded.
Check for yourself.
Shit.
Shit, Bob, where the fuck did you get that gun from?
I bought it last week off some crazy orthodox Jew.
I told you there was no rounds in this son of a bitch.
Come on, Baz, a bit of Texan Redneck Roulette can't be that bad, right?
Alright, ladies...
As I'm the only man around here,
I will go first.
What do you call a good-looking Arab, huh?
Oh, as if.
Your turn, Ari.
Give me that gun, Santa Claus.
Pussy.
The only question's where's the bullet, right?
Fuck this!
To America!
The most powerful country in the world and the dumbest,
I want to thank you for supporting us!
Hope you blow your brains out, Ari.
Oh that's right, you don't even got none.
Suck this, hillbilly!
- Do it, pussy!
Bottle, please.
Gun, please.
My pleasure, my Arabic brother.
Sukran,myJewishsister.
Pussy.
If I was sober, this would seem like a really fucking bad idea.
Cunts.
Fuck, come on!
- Give me back my bottle.
The goddamn gun.
To the greatest country in the world.
God bless...
America.
Shit!
- Fuck!
You alright?
Oh Jesus.
Shit!
- Oh God, please help me!
I was just trying to break up the hatred between you two, now I gone and blown off the balls, you know?
Now I'm just like Ari.
Alright Bob, I'm going to take off your pants, okay?
Don't get too excited.
It's all gonna be okay, you big teddy bear.
Take it the fuck off!
Man, you should see the looks on your two dumb-ass Jew-Arab faces.
You fell for that dumb shit you two.
I just can't believe it!
Gonna risk my life over a stupid fucking game, huh?
Huh?
Hey why you keep staring at my manhood?
You wanna say "Hi"?
Aw, Bob.
I pulled the old switcharoo!
Dumbass.
Ow!
It's bleeding, you motherfuckers!
It's bleeding for God's sake!
Hey Baz, give me that bottle, man.
I'm not thirsty, Ari!
I need a Band-Aid and some ice.
You're not thirsty?
- No, no!
Ahhh!
Ah come on Bubba, we've gotta clean the infected area, my friend.
No it don't hurt really, it's just my dick.
You spit on my dick, you prick.
Cheers, mate!
Oh it's bigger!
Do it again.
Bigger than what?
Where's my real gun?
Okay, pussies, we are both...
smoke some of this fine weed that I have created.
This is smooth shit, Bob.
You need to change careers.
Oh, it's in the cards.
We're all gonna die, so it's confession time.
Confession time?
- Yep.
You're a priest now?
Oh shit!
Shit, it just hit me!
This is good shit, Bob.
What the fuck are you talking about "good shit"?
This is fucking perfect shit man!
I've never felt so happy in my whole goddamn life!
Dear Lord... as we sit here today in this shitty little base,
we know our fate is around the corner.
And I would like to confess my sins to you tonight.
As a good Christian, I was brought up to love my own.
But...
I have... fallen in love.
I've fallen in love with a beautiful angel.
She's not Christian.
She's a Muslim.
Okay, I didn't see that one coming.
- Shut the fuck up, Ari!
Sorry Lord, I was just dealing with one of your chosen people.
My dear Nancy is the great love of my life.
And if you will let me live tonight, Lord,
I will marry her.
And I don't care what anybody says or thinks, I don't care... about the backlash from my family and friends.
I will marry her.
And I will be the best goddamn husband that there ever was.
Amen.
Amen!
Amen.
Amen, man!
Who's next?
I'll go...
- Okay.
Cry-baby.
I know.
Dear Lord, God...
Allah... whatever your name might be.
- Bob!
I don't think your name's Bob, but...
I want to share a bit about my life with these two good guys.
As you know...
I'm married to... a wonderful woman by the name of Jewels.
And we have one... just, just beautiful... full-of-life little girl that we named Lisa.
My wife... is Jewish!
Really?
Now, I have always believed that... religion is a doubled-edge sword.
On the one hand, it brings faith, hope, guidance.
And on the other, it brings hatred to other religions, old rules that sometimes don't work in today's world,
- and division amongst society.
-
- Ain't that the truth.
So before I die tonight,
I want to thank you for letting me be the kind of person who loves all and hates all by their actions, not their religion.
Oh, and I hope you have fine Havana cigars in Heaven.
Amen, job done, over and out, bye-bye!
Ari, your turn.
Well, uh...
I grew up in a very religious house, you know, we have strong roots to our land.
So I did my national service, you know, I went to the Golani Brigade.
And then after my service, I went to study abroad in London.
And I came back to Israel with a new look on life.
I was meeting new people, new cultures, drugs, women...
Hell yeah!
...and uh, then... my sister was killed... by a suicide bomber.
In the back of my mind,
I always disliked Arabs.
But ever since then, it turned into an all-consuming hatred.
I'm sorry to hear that, Ari.
Yeah, yeah.
- We are not all bad men.
Yeah, you know, but tonight, you know, like, talking with you guys, I may have found some peace.
I know one man's actions can't reflect an entire race.
I don't know if it's you, or this clown, here, or the weed that pulled me out of this black fucking hole!
Fuck this man, I'm gonna forgive.
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna move on.
Okay, let's do this.
Let's move on.
Let's move on!
Okay, okay enough of this hugging shit, alright?
!
I got some secret magical weed.
More weed?
Uh huh!
You freak, Bob, you know you have a problem, right?
It's called "Mother Mary."
- Mother Mary?
-
- Yeah.
What's in Mother Mary?
LSD skank and some LSD and some coke.
Are you nuts?
!
Hey, come on, all you pussies!
Let's smoke this bad-ass shit!
Nuts got nothing to do with it.
Whoa!
The coke is king.
My father is gonna fucking murder me.
No that soldier is when he comes through that door.
Fuck, Bob, fuck!
Angels, angels.
- What?
Angels!
Oh, shit!
Give me a kiss!
Look at this!
Drink it!
It's called a shotgun, not a bullet.
Welcome back to "The Heavenly View."
I hope you all had a fabulous weekend and didn't party too hard with Lucifer.
That cheeky bastard sure knows how to throw a party.
I have a letter here from "smack bang in the middle of conflict town."
Ari and Baz have sent in a few questions for us holy souls to answer.
The first question is from Ari and it reads:
Why are the chosen people being persecuted?
Ari, stop your whining.
Each and every race and religion at one time or another has been persecuted by each other since this day care center opened.
Yes, you have to stop thinking "us" and start thinking "we."
That "us" is the source of all evil.
Exactly, I agree with the tart.
Uh right, so the next question that we've got, this one is from "fat-ass Bob."
He wants to know:
"What's with all the fighting in the Middle East?"
It's a good question, chunky!
Oh my dad!
What can I say?
We the people of the Middle East, we have short tempers.
Ah, fat Bob, there will be peace in the Middle East in about 35 years or so.
Um, Jews and Arabs will be making babies.
I love the mixed races.
They have that nice coffee-colored look.
Right, and Baz, he wants to know:
"Will the powerful governments of today ever fall?"
Right, what do you think, Tes?
Bitch!
- Cow!
Hey, show some respect.
Sorry, the answer is, of course, yes.
Duh, nothing lasts forever.
Ma'am...
Name, soldier?
Private Sanchez, ma'am.
Where is the rest of your uniform?
Uh...
It's over there.
I haven't seen you before.
What is with your pants?
This look like the Lebanese cam.
Oh no, no uh...
This is what we wear in Afghanistan.
I just got in this morning.
Who has been drinking?
Me, me, sir.
I mean, ma'am.
It was my birthday.
So I made myself a pie, a couple of drinks to go with it--
This is an Israeli communication center.
We rely on you for information at a second's notice.
You're having a party!
And you two are sleeping.
- Permission to speak.
- Shut the fuck up!
This is Midmin.
I need the military police down here at once.
Three drunken soldiers asleep at their post.
I'm not drunk, I'm high.
I know, a disgrace.
Two American soldier.
I wish you wouldn't do this to us.
What's so funny?
I'm--
I'm fucking with you!
You should see your faces!
You knobs were pissing in your pants!
I pissed in my pants.
What are you wearing, mate?
Oh you know, some boots, cowboy boots, my boxers, my cowboy hat, T-shirt and a pie.
Fuck that, I've got three months left of my service
Thailand, here I come bitches.
Hell yeah, whoooo!
Lets have some pie.
- Yeah, let's do that.
Well, this is just uh...
Perfect timing.
Let's have some pie.
Pie?
- Yeah, why not pie?
So how's the pie?
It's better than the shit they serve us on base.
Sanchez...
You like the Arabs?
Well they're people, right?
Human beings.
Bob, you like the Arabs?
Sure, ask Sanchez.
How was Afghanistan?
Five star hotels, strip clubs at every corner...
A great place to bring up a family.
L'chaim!
L'chaim!
Gotta go, boys.
Let's see what those crazy Lebanese are up to.
Listen, Sanchez, or whoever you are, we're heading southeast, okay?
I have no idea what you're talking about, you whining Brit.
A fucking Aussie, what are the chances of that?
Yeah, what are the chances?
Well boys...
This seems like a good time to make my move back across the border like a good soldier.
I hate goodbyes.
Me too.
You're okay for an Arab.
And you're okay for a Jew.
You're both okay.
Okay.
Are you sure you know the way this time?
- Yep.
-
- Facebook me.
Will do, Bob.
You boys play nice now!
What the fuck!
We're fucked now, Bob.
Oh shit.
Let's just get high, fuck it.
I never liked Arabs to begin with.
Listen, you fucks!
Put your weapons down or I'll shoot this guy where he stands!
If you don't put your weapons down, I'll shoot him, you'll shoot me, and nobody wants that.
Least of all fucking me!
Put the guns down and move back 20 steps, lets go!
Now I don't want any trouble,
I just wound up in the wrong place at the wrong fucking time!
Now put them down, take 20 steps back!
Keep going, go on!
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, it's been a pleasure entertaining you this morning!
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Hello?
- Ha?
Hey, you crazy bastard.
Hey, what's this I hear about your men killing one of mine?
You killed two of my soldiers, you asshole!
Listen, listen, my old friend.
You want to go to war, you just say the word, okay?
You think you are tough because you have new weapons and tanks and planes.
Well, you can shove that all up your ass, you donkey!
Donkey ha, that's funny ha, you're funny, you prick!
Listen to me, what are we going to do about this mess now?
I got the whole media breathing down my neck and...
I've got too much on my plate, you know?
Relax, brother, this is the problem with democracy, you have people to answer to, asshole.
So what's your plan, penis-face?
We tell the world that both our soldiers were in the right.
Then we go back and forth like a game of tennis for a month or two, and let the whole thing blow over.
Okay, sounds good to me!
Now listen, I'm going to bed now, dick-licker.
And say hello to your beautiful wife, okay?
Shave your balls, monkey-ass.
Tell the wife thanks for the carrot cake.
Monkey-ass!
Alright, one for you, one for me, here we go.
And this one's for our good friend, Baz.
I wonder where--
- Thanks, fuck-face!
Oh hell no!
There he is!
Hit me, Bob!
You fat fuck!
You got a beard.
You kissed me with a beard,
You made me feel bad about myself.
War's a bitch, man, but I love it!
You boys ready to do this?
Hell yeah!
I don't know how to swim, though!
Latin lover narrator:
Glad you're back.
Here we go.
As you know, jane was accidentally inseminated
With rafael's sperm.
I accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago.
Latin lover narrator:
Oh, and the doctor?
She was rafael's sister.
And rafael underwrote her medical malpractice insurance.
No one would insure luisa with her history of addiction.
But jane didn't know that,
And rafael wasn't about to tell her.
And from there, things got complicated.
See, jane was with michael, but now she's not.
And rafael was with petra.
We're done, petra.
And despite jane's reservations...
What's better for a baby than its parents actually together?
...Jane and rafael were falling for each other.
Unfortunately, jane's mother, xo, did not approve.
Rafael is already a bad influence on you.
He's a good guy.
For the record, xiomara's love life was complicated as well.
See, she was falling for jane's father,
Telenovela star rogelio de la vega.
But she broke it off.
You have to focus on your relationship with jane,
And I'll only get in the way.
And she was currently distracting herself
With a new man.
Good to see you.
And speaking of complicated,
Dr. Luisa had been hooking up
With her stepmother, rose.
That is, until she fell off the wagon and disappeared.
I don't know where you are.
Oh, and michael was currently on the hunt
For the notorious drug dealer known as sin rostro.
And honestly, there are
A gazillion other things going on.
But we should just get started, right?
As a young girl,
Jane gloriana villanueva loved to hear stories.
Okay, so tell me what happened.
From the very beginning.
Well, first the producer said
He loved my voice.
Then he said
I had great energy up there.
Xiomara:
Oh, sorry, ma.
I didn't mean to wake you.
Oh, shoot.
I thought I paid this.
Mom, it's a parking ticket.
I'll pay the fine.
So...
What is it about?
I like long stories.
So what does that have to do with mom's parking ticket?
How can I be patient?
I haven't seen you in two weeks.
I know, I know.
I-I miss you, too.
I'm hurrying.
Latin lover narrator:
Do you know what?
I'm gonna stop right here.
I should really set the stage.
Fill in some gaps.
(phone chimes) ah, yes.
This is where we left off.
Rafael, you'll remember, was about to meet jane, when...
We've got to talk.
Dad, not right now.
You're fired.
What?
Why?
Narrator:
And here's what you didn't see.
I'm sorry.
I felt obligated to tell your father.
You're jeopardizing the hotel.
What the hell are you talking about?
The fact that you put up your shares of the hotel
For luisa's medical malpractice insurance.
I did that, dad, but come on.
You're the one who always says
Family comes first, right?
The problem is,
Luisa needs to answer to this lawsuit in two weeks.
If she doesn't, this waitress...
Jane.
Right.
Jane.
Jane could get a default judgment
And then lay claim to your 20% of the marbella.
Latin lover narrator:
And that led to this.
(phone rings)
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm on my way to the airport.
I have to go to mexico city.
What?
Why?
It has to do with your lawsuit
And my sister.
But, jane, I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
Oh.
Uh...
Church and state,
We separate everything.
Don't tell me why you're going to mexico city
As someone who's suing your sister.
Tell me as...
Someone who cares about you
And wants to know why the hell you're going to mexico city.
If luisa doesn't come back in two weeks,
Then you get a default judgment against her.
Latin lover narrator:
I should pause to point out
That jane had no idea that rafael's hotel was on the line.
And he wasn't about to tell her.
We have a hacienda in mexico city.
I've been tracking her credit cards.
Just to make sure she's alive.
I really hope you find her.
Latin lover narrator:
And that brings us...
I'm sorry you didn't find her.
It was like chasing a ghost.
A drunk ghost.
San miguel, mexico city, tulum...
Jane:
She probably figures
Her insurance will take care of my lawsuit.
So how was teaching?
Oh, you know...
Uneventful.
A lot of grading papers.
Latin lover narrator:
There was one other thing.
She also spent a great deal of time
Hugging churchgoers who thought she could grant miracles
Because she was a pregnant virgin.
But jane wasn't about to tell him that.
I just want to see you.
I've really missed you.
I'm here.
Hi.
Hi.
What?
You're showing.
(laughs)
Yeah, I am, a little, right?
Are you still feeling good?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So...
This is my place.
Yeah, I've been here, actually.
With petra.
Latin lover narrator:
Ah, yes.
Petra.
I'm not gonna lie.
The last two weeks have been tough for petra.
You can't keep ordering room service.
When I settle my divorce, I'm going to have to pay it off.
Oh, petra, stop.
We are cooped up in this tiny room.
Ivan:
Yeah.
Oh, stop.
You're no better.
Latin lover narrator:
Having a hostage
Was turning into a major headache.
Who needs lobster every night?
(phone ringing)
Hello?
Rafael's back.
Here we go.
No more leaving, okay?
Okay.
I missed you so much, jane.
Should we move to the bedroom?
Latin lover narrator:
Ah.
Now it's time for jane
To tell him she's a virgin.
I should probably go home.
I have court tomorrow, so...
Oh.
Uh...
Okay.
Um...
Well, can I take you to dinner?
To celebrate your victory?
Winning a default judgment against your sister?
Church and state.
Maybe afterwards, you could even...
Sleep over.
Latin lover narrator:
Okay, tell him right now.
And speaking of sleeping over,
Remember marco, xo's soccer-playing hottie?
The past few weeks had been pretty good for them.
(crashing)
Less good, however, for rogelio.
Oh.
Rogelio.
Again.
Ugh, it's so annoying.
He's trying to get close to jane, so...
I should probably head in.
Oh.
But first, eva would like you to come over
For an official family dinner.
Like with place mats and everything.
Sounds good.
(rattling)
Bye.
Bye.
Rogelio:
Oh, hello, xiomara.
Finished with your date so soon?
What are you even doing here again?
I was actually helping jane prepare for court.
I have played many lawyers,
So I was giving her lots of tips.
Ah.
Got it.
Avoiding rogelio and his legal tips?
Yeah, something about...
Putting hand sanitizer under my eyes,
So that I can cry.
Oh...
So...
How was the big reunion with rafael?
It was good.
Uh-oh.
What happened?
We...
Had a moment in his penthouse
Where I could have told him
That I'm not having sex, but I didn't.
Makes sense.
I don't know how a guy like that responds.
Seriously?
What?
"a guy like that"?
I'm sorry.
I-I just don't really see you two together.
I mean, you're so different.
You just are.
Great.
Thanks for the talk.
I feel so much better now.
Jane, I'm just being honest,
Just like you're honest with me
When you don't like someone.
Rafael's not "someone."
I'm having his baby.
You're right.
Petra:
I heard you were back.
I live here.
The question is, why are you still here?
Well, I don't really have any money, do I?
Till we settle our divorce, anyway.
Of course, for the right price,
I would move on now.
Were you always a monster?
Or did you become one along the way?
Should we...
Review our courtship?
I was engaged to a man I loved.
Who loved me.
You were passed over for a promotion
And so, to get back at lachlan,
You set your sights on me.
So tell me, rafael,
Who's the monster?
But you see,
I had the advantage,
Because I always knew you were an entitled playboy
With a tendency to self-sabotage.
And jane will find out soon enough.
Don't you dare mention jane.
How chivalrous.
Let's be real.
You two won't last.
She's a good girl.
And...
Well...
We've already established what you are.
Mom, hurry up!
We can't be late to court!
Are you not coming, abuela?
Okay, okay, I'm ready.
One more button, ma.
Got it.
Okay, so, what's the procedure?
The lawyer said it should be easy.
Since luisa's not here,
We'll request a default judgment.
A default judgment is ridiculous, your honor.
With all due respect,
A week is all we're asking.
Another week?
Your honor, no.
That's another week into my client's unwanted pregnancy.
This event has derailed
Her life.
And dr.
Alver is exhibiting that same recklessness now
By not answering this claim.
Luisa:
Actually, no, I'm here.
Hi!
I am so sorry that I'm late.
Judge:
Dr. Alver,
I presume?
(chuckles)
Latin lover narrator:
You're probably wondering where luisa has been.
Until a week ago, luisa was
Drinking tequila,
Kissing strange women,
And dancing naked.
I was lost,
But, your honor,
I stand before you here today,
Ready to accept any punishment that you deem necessary.
Judge:
This isn't a sentencing.
You just have to answer the petition.
Oh.
Well, then I answer it.
I'm here.
I do need to consult with my client.
Absolutely not.
This is ridiculous.
(gavel bangs) she's here to answer the petition.
There's no default judgment.
Dr. Alver,
This is your last chance.
Don't worry, your honor.
I'm back.
Rafael:
Where the hell were you?
I chased you all over mexico.
Yes, I know.
I was in peru
On an ayahuasca retreat.
What the hell is ayahuasca?
Is that the psychedelic drink that makes you constantly vomit?
Exactly, but...
But it's like you're vomiting out everything
That's wrong with your life.
It's, it's really difficult to describe,
But I had a shaman, and I was guided through this journey,
And in my journey,
I saw everything so clearly.
Latin lover narrator:
Full disclosure, I tried it.
Did nothing for me.
What's clear
Is that you are an addict.
Yes.
Exactly.
But why?
Why?
What was I trying to escape?
And then it dawned on me.
Money is the root of all my problems.
Latin lover narrator:
Well, money and the fact that
She inseminated the wrong woman with rafael's sperm.
We're gonna talk about this later.
I'm glad you're home.
Thanks, daddy.
We should talk.
I would really like that.
Latin lover narrator:
I should stop here,
Catch you up on jane and michael.
Yep, it's been that awkward.
You okay?
Don't even have time to think about her.
We're hours away from the biggest moment of our career.
You sure the shipment's coming in today?
You confident in your contact at the coast guard?
Yeah.
Michael, I...
I get that seeing jane around every day is hard.
Nadine, stop.
We agreed we're just having fun, right?
Latin lover narrator:
And by fun, he means this.
Let's just hope
The drugs come in and lead us
To sin rostro.
Rogelio:
Lemonade?
In high school, you only drank lemonade
When you were feeling sad.
Well, things aren't going very well at the moment.
Latin lover narrator:
With marco, please say with marco.
I came by here to see if they needed me
To fill any spots in the lounge,
But they said they were all full.
(sighs)
Once again, I'm back to square one.
Don't worry.
I believe in you almost as much
As I believe in myself.
Thanks, rogelio.
(zaps) ow!
Ow!
Must be my shoes.
Finest italian leather.
(chuckles)
I'm worried.
Dad,
Luisa actually doesn't seem crazy.
A psychedelic drink,
And she has a spiritual awakening?
Idiotic, yes,
But not clinically crazy.
I agree with rafael.
For what it's worth.
In any case, she's back.
So I would really like my job back as well.
I'll toe the line.
Fine.
But you'll answer to lachlan.
Okay, got it.
Hey, lachlan.
So, I just got an interesting call from your father.
Yeah.
I answer to you now.
Petra:
Well, to me,
Actually.
What the hell
Are you doing here?
Petra has some connections
In miami society.
She agreed to help us
Bounce back from your mishaps.
I'm not working for petra.
Oh.
Hmm.
I thought your father was pretty clear about it.
You answer to me, and...
Well...
This is
What I want.
Screw you both.
Okay, but why would lachlan want to hire petra?
'cause he wants to get under my skin.
Why?
He was actually engaged to petra at one point.
What?
I kind of...
Stole her from him.
Oh.
Look, I was a different guy back then.
I'm reacting.
At least let me react.
Your scotch.
Thank you.
And some chips
And our spinach-artichoke dip.
Oh, we didn't actually order anything.
They're from that couple over there.
They said it was for jane the virgin.
Latin lover narrator:
Uh-oh.
I'm s...
Uh, j...
Jane the virgin?
Thank you.
Jane the virgin?
What does that mean?
Well...
It's, um...
It's a web site.
Do you remember rogelio's stepdaughters?
Yeah.
They started it to be making fun of me.
Just say it.
And the fact that I'm a virgin.
Which I am.
(chuckles):
And now a pregnant virgin.
Huh.
So, the web site-- it went viral, and...
Now, you know, some people believe,
Because I'm a pregnant virgin, that I can grant miracles.
Wait, what?
I can't, just to be clear.
Uh, wow.
A virgin?
Yeah.
Wait, so you and michael never...
No.
Not even after you got engaged?
No. (chuckles)
Really?
No!
(chuckles)
Not even...
Rafael?
I made a promise to my grandma when I was young
That I would wait till marriage.
That's what I've done.
And that's still your plan?
Yes.
Definitely.
That's...
That's...
That's great.
(exhales):
Oh, yeah.
Excuse me.
You need another drink?
I'm reacting.
I can react, right?
Yeah, you're allowed to react.
Waitress:
Another scotch?
Uh, yes, please.
It should be noted that michael did not react like this
When she told him she was a virgin.
But that's neither here nor there.
Check that number.
Nadine:
8-3-2.
Yeah, that's it.
You realize this could be huge for us, right?
We follow this shipment, learn where sin rostro has been hiding.
Okay, we got to stay focused.
We got to stay focused.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
Michael:
Here we go.
Look, I'm sorry I freaked out, okay?
I'm over it.
It's fine.
Fine?
Uh, you just surprised me, that's all.
Yeah, I definitely got that.
It's just, it's not something that you normally hear.
Not...
No, not that you're not normal.
It's fine.
I get it.
Fine?
Yeah, fine.
Look, it's been a long day-- I just think
We should call it a night.
Jane...
Rafael, I'm tired.
Fine.
(sighs)
(loud banging) what?
(banging)
Oh!
Get down, get down.
Nadine:
Is that sin rostro?
Michael:
No way.
Sin rostro's already in miami, and we've got intel to back that up.
Okay, so maybe it's his new contact,
Whoever's taking over for roman zazo.
We got to go.
Hi, babe.
Hey.
You'll never guess who called here tonight.
Elliot lantana.
He's an actual legitimate record producer.
He heard me sing at the club,
And he wants to record a demo with me!
That's amazing, ma.
I know, right?
Watch out, paulina rubio!
Hon?
Hmm?
How'd it go with rafael?
Did you tell him you're waiting?
Come on.
I got your message loud and clear.
I'm on board.
Did you tell him?
How did he take it?
Well.
He took it well.
Good.
Mm-hmm.
I was just so worried.
About you.
I know.
I'm sorry.
(sighs) but how I felt about you--
That's part of what I was running from.
No, I get that.
Look, here's the thing.
When I was in the sweat lodge,
Drinking my tea,
Throwing up, being guided by my shaman,
I kept...
Seeing your face.
It was a little distorted,
But...
It was you.
Luisa.
I came here to be truthful and honest.
And if I'm being truthful and honest...
I still want to be with you.
I want us to tell
Everyone what happened and just...
Run away together.
We can't do that.
It's over.
For real, this time.
(long sigh)
Ah...
I had a feeling you might say that.
Regardless,
We still have to tell my father what happened between us.
What?
My shaman thinks it's really important
For me to just come clean about all my lies.
Your shaman doesn't understand the situation.
No, he really does.
Luisa,
It will destroy my marriage.
Or make it stronger.
(quietly):
What are you talking about?
Rose...
I know this is gonna be hard,
But trust me, once you do it,
You're gonna feel so much better.
Healthier.
Don't worry.
I'll give you time to...
To figure out how to break it to him.
Tell my father.
Or I will.
Woman:
Long day?
Oh, yeah.
Me, too.
(chuckles)
The longest.
Oh, here, have mine.
I haven't touched it, I swear.
No, that's...
It's fine, thank you.
Come on, I paid 17 bucks for this thing.
I swear, this place is such a rip-off.
Thank you.
Cheers.
(chuckles)
Oh.
(both chuckle)
What's he doing?
Well, considering he's at the front desk getting a key I'm gonna go with checking in.
Thanks, wiseass.
Makes sense that he's here;
This is the hub of the sin rostro operation.
Did you get the picture?
Yep.
Great.
I'll get it to my friend at the fbi to run face recognition.
You trust this friend?
Yeah, absolutely.
(xiomara singing in spanish)
â™ª this is my life and this is my turn â™ª â™ª chasing the dreams that I long for â™ª â™ª I know that love, it will conquer... â™ª
Man:
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop, stop.
Here is the problem.
While you were singing, I kept wishing I was singing.
So I need you to get me out of my head.
How do I do that?
Dig deeper, xiomara.
Dig deeper.
Oh, just one second, one second.
â™ª dig deeper, deeper, deeper. â™ª
Sorry, song idea.
Get me out of my head.
Understand?
Okay, let's go from the top again.
Jane, can you take some mimosas up to room 467?
I don't do room service.
Well, you served one of our vip guests the other day,
And apparently he's taken a liking to you.
To be clear, that's creepy,
Uh, and I'm not going into the room.
Just deliver the mimosas.
Woman:
Come on in.
Uh, where can I put this?
Oh, my...
Jane.
Jane.
Jane!
Rafael:
Jane!
Jane!
Jane!
Listen, stop.
Let me explain.
I told you I was a virgin, and you had sex
With the first girl you could find.
That is not true.
Okay, so then what happened?
(stammers) I'm not sure.
What?
(stammers)
I don't remember anything from last night.
(scoffs)
Yeah, that's not a good explanation.
What happened last night?
Oh, you know, the usual.
Had a couple drinks, came back here.
D-did we, uh, did we have sex?
Come on, yeah.
Of course we did.
They're fake, if that's what you're wondering.
No, actually wondering
What my girlfriend is doing between them.
Well, thank you so much.
This has been such a thrill.
I don't know how I can ever pay you back.
You don't need to pay me back.
When a friend asks me for a favor, I cannot refuse.
What friend?
Rogelio.
Why else do you think
We did not make love in the sound booth?
It was embarrassing.
Had he even heard me sing?
Did he even see my youtube videos?
No, he hadn't.
But I knew once he heard you, he'd be a fan.
Ugh.
(electric zap) oh, come on.
Latin lover narrator:
A spark.
Don't be angry.
It was a nice thing I did.
Wasn't it?
Yeah, it was.
So, what's our problem?
Latin lover narrator:
The fact that she desperately did not want
To have feelings for him.
Nothing.
There's no problem.
Hey, aren't you teaching this afternoon?
Yeah, I have a few more minutes before I have to leave.
Oh, no.
What happened?
(sighs)
You were right about rafael, okay?
Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to be right.
I don't even know what I was thinking.
I mean, we're so different.
Trust me, hon, I get it.
Especially because it would have been so perfect,
If it had worked out.
Yeah, it really would have.
I need to talk to you.
Is everything okay?
I don't know.
I don't know if I should say something
Or not say something.
About what?
Your sister.
Well, then you should definitely say something.
She is having a sort of breakdown.
And I hate saying this.
But, given her history and her mother...
Rose,
What happened?
I went to go see her.
To check in.
Rafael, it was awful.
The things that she was saying to me,
All these...
Sexual things.
And I didn't know how to respond.
I didn't know what to do.
It's okay.
You did the right thing
By coming to me.
Latin lover narrator:
Ooh, not nice, rose.
All right, you know the reading assignment--
The taming of the shrew.
Enjoy, and I know...
Student:
Who are you?
It's really you.
Jane the virgin.
All right, that's enough.
Get moving!
We met this morning.
Yes, I recall.
Right.
Look, uh...
What you think happened,
It didn't.
Yeah, I was there.
Something obviously happened.
No, I was paid to drug him and make it seem like we had sex.
Latin lover narrator:
Oh, is that all?
What?
I'm an escort.
Uh, my manager got me the gig.
It was all online, I don't even know who set it up.
Oh, my god.
Look, I only did it because it was easy money.
But then your boyfriend told me
That you're jane the virgin,
And I'm a really religious woman.
Which I know is hard to believe given, you know,
What I do.
Anyway,
I'm really sorry.
Okay.
Thank you for telling me that.
Yeah.
So...
Can I have a hug?
Excuse me?
I could really use a miracle.
I have a son.
And I haven't seen him in a while
Due to a-a couple of circumstances.
I've been in some bad situations, but...
I really want to see him.
And maybe if I hug you...
I don't want to give you false hope.
I am not a religious messiah.
What happened to me was a medical mistake.
But can I give you a hug anyway?
Yeah.
I really hope you get to see your son.
(speaking spanish)
They don't actually give awards out to shows like this, do they?
Well, y-you can't tell anything from just one scene, okay?
There's a...
There's a larger story.
Anyway,
They do give out awards,
And I've actually booked the afterparty here.
In the hotel.
How did you do that?
One of the divas recovered from extensive plastic surgery
In one of our medical recovery suites.
I promised that secret would never get out.
And I thought you took this job just to make rafael squirm.
Well, the better the hotel does,
The more money I make in my divorce.
It's always about money with you, isn't it?
Though setting rafael up with that escort, that...
That seems personal.
True.
I also despise him.
And leaving you for him was the biggest mistake of my life.
Is that what you want to hear?
Well, it's true.
I should get back to my mother.
Rafael:
It had to have been petra.
She's the only person crazy enough to set me up.
So crazy.
You know,
I'm just gonna expedite her settlement.
I don't want to deal with it anymore.
I want it to end and I don't want it
To get in the way of...
Us.
What "us"?
Come on.
Last night, our dinner...
It was awful!
(laughs) I know and I'm sorry.
I freaked out when you told me you'd never had sex.
And...
I don't know.
It was unexpected.
And I acted like an idiot.
And honestly, once I thought about it,
It doesn't even matter.
You know, I'll wait as long as I have to...
I just...
It's not only that.
Now, look what happened
When you lost your job and found out I was a virgin.
You got to cut me some slack, jane.
That was a tough moment.
Yeah.
Life is full of tough moments.
You have to fight for what you want.
Look, I just think
That maybe we read too much into things
Between us.
We're having a baby.
Let's focus on that.
Latin lover narrator:
And speaking
Of not working out...
So, we should nail down a date for dinner with my daughter.
Let it be known
That at that moment, xiomara prayed for a spark.
I don't think I should.
Why?
Look, you're a great guy.
And because you're a great guy,
I wanted it to work out.
So I've been ignoring the fact
That there's something missing here.
What's going on?
Please...
Sit down, luisa.
Who are you?
My name is dr.
Perez.
Emilio:
Try to stay calm, luisa.
What?
What's going on?
I'm so sorry, luisa.
I had to tell them what you were saying.
Tell them what?
About...
Us?
Ah...
You mean our affair?
See?
Luisa?
You're having some sort of episode.
Fantasizing about me.
What?
!
What?
!
Luisa, you got to stay calm.
We were, we were lovers!
I don't know what happened.
Rafael:
The doctor has
Medications to give you.
She's lying!
She's lying!
Stop lying!
I don't know what I did to trigger this...
The same thing happened with her mother--
A psychotic break.
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
(all clamoring)
Why are you lying?
!
Why are you doing this?
!
Stop!
Stop lying!
Why are you doing this?
!
Oh!
Stop lying!
Please!
Liar!
Emilio:
I have no choice.
I have to commit her.
Abuela, you ready for the world premiere of mom's song?
Oh, sorry.
Whenever you're ready, we'll head to the hotel.
(whispers):
Mom.
Is everything okay with abuela?
She's in there with the rosary again.
Oh.
What is it?
It's your lawsuit.
Remember that time I forgot to pay my parking ticket?
I wasn't even thinking about how she feels about court.
If grandpa's family was so rich,
Why aren't we rich?
Why?
Stupid immigration laws.
And I get that, ma.
And I'll be more careful.
Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted
That was the last ticket
Xiomara ever got.
Oh, I didn't even think.
It's just a civil procedure.
Yeah, and she knows that.
And she's fine with it.
But then petra started acting all crazy,
And the family's so powerful...
She's just nervous, that's all.
Wanted to see me?
Yeah, go ahead and shut that.
So, I've been thinking...
About how you said you made a mistake.
And I agree.
You did.
(passionate moaning)
Lachlan, I-I don't...
Wait.
I'm deleting it.
I never stopped missing you.
(cell phone dings)
I got an I.D. On the picture I sent.
The guy's a possible serbian war criminal.
What?
What the hell does a serbian have to do with sin rostro?
I don't know.
The guy's been awfully quiet in there.
I don't like this.
(phone rings) (sighs)
Hello?
Uh, no.
Yeah, this is rafael.
What?
All right, I'm gonna go have luca put this on
And you guys grab a seat.
Okay.
Oh, rogelio's here.
I invited him to hear it.
Since he's the one who set up the recording session.
Mm-hmm.
Come on, ma.
Okay.
(speaks spanish)
Xiomara.
So, where's mark?
You mean marco?
Is that not what I said?
We broke up.
But in case you were thinking it had anything
To do with you...
Latin lover narrator:
It did.
And he was.
...It didn't.
Just because he wasn't right doesn't mean you are.
Of course.
I agree 100%.
(music playing)
Ah.
Is that your song?
Just beautiful.
(petra moaning)
Latin lover narrator:
Hmm.
I guess he didn't delete it after all.
Housekeeping.
He's gone.
What the hell?
Where'd he go?
Jane.
Did petra talk to you?
Is that why you withdrew the lawsuit?
What?
No, I just got a...
I got a call from my lawyer
Saying that you withdrew.
I did, but that wasn't because of petra.
It was...
It was...
It was for my grandma.
She's not a legal resident in this country,
And the whole thing was making her nervous.
And it's not only that.
I was thinking about
What my lawyer said in court,
About how this baby was not wanted.
And I don't feel like that anymore.
So what am I doing this for, really-- for the money?
'cause that just feels ugly.
Especially because you are absolutely
Going to take care of your child, financially.
Of course I am.
I'm gonna need that in writing.
Done.
Wait, wh...
What was it that you thought petra told me?
Latin lover narrator:
And so rafael
Finally told jane the truth.
I...
Underwrote my sister's
Medical malpractice insurance.
So your lawsuit...
You were actually suing me.
What?
I-I just didn't want to
Affect your decision to sue.
I had no idea.
I know.
I've also been thinking about what you told me.
About how I need to fight for things.
And you're right.
I do.
So I'm gonna work for lachlan.
And petra, as long as she's here.
And I'm gonna fight for you, too.
Jane, this-this is...
This is hard.
Look, we're doing everything backwards.
I mean, we're having a baby and-and then
We're going on our first date?
But I want to be with you.
And I'm not giving up.
Latin lover narrator:
Oh, if only it were that easy.

Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org
Latin lover narrator:
Glad you're back.
Here we go.
As you know, Jane was accidentally inseminated with Rafael's sperm.
I accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago.
Latin lover narrator:
Oh, and the doctor?
She was Rafael's sister.
And Rafael underwrote her medical malpractice insurance.
No one would insure Luisa with her history of addiction.
But Jane didn't know that, and Rafael wasn't about to tell her.
And from there, things got complicated.
See, Jane was with Michael, but now she's not.
- And Rafael was with Petra.
- We're done, Petra.
And despite Jane's reservations...
What's better for a baby than its parents actually together?
Jane and Rafael were falling for each other.
Unfortunately, Jane's mother, Xo, did not approve.
- Rafael is already a bad influence on you.
- He's a good guy.
For the record, Xiomara's love life was complicated as well.
See, she was falling for Jane's father, telenovela star Rogelio De La Vega.
But she broke it off.
You have to focus on your relationship with Jane, and I'll only get in the way.
And she was currently distracting herself
- with a new man.
- Good to see you.
And speaking of complicated,
Dr. Luisa had been hooking up with her stepmother, Rose.
That is, until she fell off the wagon and disappeared.
I don't know where you are.
Oh, and Michael was currently on the hunt for the notorious drug dealer known as Sin Rostro.
And honestly, there are a gazillion other things going on.
But hould just get started, right?
As a young girl,
Jane Gloriana Villanueva loved to hear stories.
Okay, so tell me what happened.
From the very beginning.
Well, first the producer said he loved my voice.
Then he said
I had great energy up there.
_
Xiomara:
Oh, sorry, ma.
I didn't mean to wake you.
_
_
Oh, shoot.
I thought I paid this.
_
Mom, it's a parking ticket.
I'll pay the fine.
_
_
So... what is it about?
_
I like long stories.
_
_
_
_
_
So what does that have to do with mom's parking ticket?
_
_
How can I be patient?
I haven't seen you in two weeks.
I know, I know.
I-I miss you, too.
I'm hurrying.
Latin lover narrator:
Do you know what?
I'm gonna stop right here.
_
I should really set the stage.
Fill in some gaps.
- (Phone chimes)
- Ah, yes.
This is where we left off.
Rafael, you'll remember, was about to meet Jane, when...
We've got to talk.
Dad, not right now.
- You're fired.
- What?
Why?
Narrator:
And here's what you didn't see.
I'm sorry.
I felt obligated to tell your father.
You're jeopardizing the hotel.
What the hell are you talking about?
The fact that you put up your shares of the hotel for Luisa's medical malpractice insurance.
I did that, dad, but come on.
You're the one who always says family comes first, right?
The problem is,
Luisa needs to answer to this lawsuit in two weeks.
If she doesn't, this waitress...
Jane.
Right.
Jane.
Jane could get a default judgment and then lay claim to your 20% of the Marbella.
Latin lover narrator:
And that led to this.
(Phone rings)
Hey.
Where are you?
I'm on my way to the airport.
I have to go to Mexico City.
What?
Why?
It has to do with your lawsuit and my sister.
But, Jane, I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
Oh.
Uh... church and state, we separate everything.
Don't tell me why you're going to Mexico City as someone who's suing your sister.
Tell me as...
Someone who cares about you and wants to know why the hell you're going to Mexico City.
If Luisa doesn't come back in two weeks, then you get a default judgment against her.
Latin lover narrator:
I should pause to point out that Jane had no idea that Rafael's hotel was on the line.
And he wasn't about to tell her.
We have a Hacienda in Mexico City.
I've been tracking her credit cards.
Just to make sure she's alive.
I really hope you find her.
Latin lover narrator:
And that brings us... _
I'm sorry you didn't find her.
It was like chasing a ghost.
A drunk ghost.
San Miguel, Mexico City, Tulum...
Jane:
She probably figures her insurance will take care of my lawsuit.
So how was teaching?
Oh, you know... uneventful.
A lot of grading papers.
Latin lover narrator:
There was one other thing.
She also spent a great deal of time hugging churchgoers who thought she could grant miracles because she was a pregnant virgin.
But Jane wasn't about to tell him that.
I just want to see you.
I've really missed you.
I'm here.
Hi.
Hi.
What?
- You're showing.
- (Laughs)
Yeah, I am, a little, right?
Are you still feeling good?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So...
This is my place.
Yeah, I've been here, actually.
With Petra.
Latin lover narrator:
Ah, yes.
Petra.
I'm not gonna lie.
The last two weeks have been tough for Petra.
You can't keep ordering room service.
When I settle my divorce, I'm going to have to pay it off.
Oh, Petra, stop.
We are cooped up in this tiny room.
Ivan:
Yeah.
Oh, stop.
You're no better.
Latin lover narrator:
Having a hostage was turning into a major headache.
Who needs lobster every night?
(Phone ringing)
Hello?
Rafael's back.
Here we go.
No more leaving, okay?
Okay.
I missed you so much, Jane.
Should we move to the bedroom?
Latin lover narrator:
Ah.
Now it's time for Jane to tell him she's a virgin.
I should probably go home.
I have court tomorrow, so...
Oh.
Uh... okay.
Um... well, can I take you to dinner?
To celebrate your victory?
Winning a default judgment against your sister?
Church and state.
Maybe afterwards, you could even...
Sleep over.
Latin lover narrator:
Okay, tell him right now.
_
_
And speaking of sleeping over, remember Marco, Xo's soccer-playing hottie?
The past few weeks had been pretty good for them.
(Crashing)
Less good, however, for Rogelio.
Oh.
Rogelio.
Again.
Ugh, it's so annoying.
He's trying to get close to Jane, so...
I should probably head in.
Oh.
But first, Eva would like you to come over
- _ - for an official family dinner.
Like with place mats and everything.
Sounds good.
(Rattling)
- Bye.
- Bye.
Rogelio:
Oh, hello, Xiomara.
Finished with your date so soon?
What are you even doing here again?
I was actually helping Jane prepare for court.
I have played many lawyers, so I was giving her lots of tips.
Ah.
Got it.
Avoiding Rogelio and his legal tips?
Yeah, something about...
Putting hand sanitizer under my eyes, so that I can cry.
Oh...
So... how was the big reunion with Rafael?
It was good.
Uh-oh.
- What happened?
- We...
Had a moment in his penthouse where I could have told him that I'm not having sex, but I didn't.
Makes sense.
I don't know how a guy like that responds.
- Seriously?
- What?
"A guy like that"?
I'm sorry.
I-I just don't really see you two together.
I mean, you're so different.
You just are.
Great.
Thanks for the talk.
I feel so much better now.
Jane, I'm just being honest, just like you're honest with me when you don't like someone.
Rafael's not "someone."
I'm having his baby.
You're right.
Petra:
I heard you were back.
I live here.
The question is, why are you still here?
Well, I don't really have any money, do I?
Till we settle our divorce, anyway.
Of course, for the right price,
I would move on now.
Were you always a monster?
Or did you become one along the way?
Should we...
Review our courtship?
I was engaged to a man I loved.
Who loved me.
You were passed over for a promotion and so, to get back at Lachlan, you set your sights on me.
So tell me, Rafael, who's the monster?
But you see,
I had the advantage, because I always knew you were an entitled playboy with a tendency to self-sabotage.
And Jane will find out soon enough.
Don't you dare mention Jane.
How chivalrous.
Let's be real.
You two won't last.
She's a good girl.
And... well...
We've already established what you are.
_
Mom, hurry up!
We can't be late to court!
Are you not coming, Abuela?
_
Okay, okay, I'm ready.
One more button, ma.
Got it.
Okay, so, what's the procedure?
The lawyer said it should be easy.
Since Luisa's not here, we'll request a default judgment.
A default judgment is ridiculous, your honor.
With all due respect, a week is all we're asking.
_
Another week?
Your honor, no.
_
That's another week into my client's unwanted pregnancy.
This event has derailed her life.
And Dr. Alver is exhibiting that same recklessness now by not answering this claim.
Luisa:
Actually, no, I'm here.
Hi!
I am so sorry that I'm late.
Judge:
Dr. Alver,
I presume?
(Chuckles)
Latin lover narrator:
You're probably wondering where Luisa has been.
Until a week ago, Luisa was drinking tequila, kissing strange women, and dancing naked.
I was lost, but, your honor,
I stand before you here today, ready to accept any punt that you deem necessary.
Judge:
This isn't a sentencing.
You just have to answer the petition.
Oh.
Well, then I answer it.
I'm here.
Solano lawyer:
Your honor,
I do need to consult with my client.
Absolutely not.
This is ridiculous.
- (Gavel bangs)
- She's here to answer the petition.
There's no default judgment.
Dr. alver, this is your last chance.
Don't worry, your honor.
I'm back.
Rafael:
Where the hell were you?
I chased you all over Mexico.
Yes, I know.
I was in Peru on an yahuasca retreat.
What the hell is ayahuasca?
_
Is that the psychedelic drink that makes you constantly vomit?
Exactly, but...
But it's like you're vomiting out everything that's wrong with your life.
It's, it's really difficult to describe, but I had a shaman, and I was guided through this journey, and in my journey,
I saw everything so clearly.
Latin lover narrator:
Full disclosure, I tried it.
Did nothing for me.
What's clear is that you are an addict.
Yes.
Exactly.
But why?
Why?
What was I trying to escape?
And then it dawned on me.
Money is the root of all my problems.
Latin lover narrator:
Well, money and the fact that she inseminated the wrong woman with Rafael's sperm.
We're gonna talk about this later.
I'm glad you're home.
Thanks, daddy.
We should talk.
I would really like that.
Latin lover narrator:
I should stop here, catch you up on Jane and Michael.
Yep, it's been that awkward.
- You okay?
- Don't even have time to think about her.
We're hours away from the biggest moment of our career.
You sure the shipment's coming in today?
You confident in your contact at the coast guard?
Yeah.
Michael...
I get that seeing Jane around every day is hard.
Nadine, stop.
We agreed we're just having fun, right?
Latin lover narrator:
And by fun, he means this.
Let's just hope the drugs come in and lead us to Sin Rostro.
Rogelio:
Lemonade?
In high school, you only drank lemonade when you were feeling sad.
Well, things aren't going very well at the moment.
Latin lover narrator:
With Marco, please say with Marco.
I came by here to see if they needed me to fill any spots in the lounge, but they said they were all full.
(Sighs)
Once again, I'm back to square one.
Don't worry.
I believe in you almost as much as I believe in myself.
Thanks, Rogelio.
- (Zaps)
- Both:
Ow!
Must be my shoes.
Finest Italian leather.
(Chuckles)
I'm worried.
Dad,
Luisa actually doesn't seem crazy.
A psychedelic drink, and she has a spiritual awakening?
Idiotic, yes, but not clinically crazy.
I agree with Rafael.
For what it's worth.
In any case, she's back.
So I would really like my job back as well.
I'll toe the line.
Fine.
But you'll answer to Lachlan.
Okay, got it.
Hey, Lachlan.
So, I just got an interesting call from your father.
Yeah.
I answer to you now.
Petra:
Well, to me,
- actually.
- What the hell are you doing here?
Petra has some connections in Miami society.
She agreed to help us bounce back from your mishaps.
I'm not working for Petra.
Oh.
Hmm.
I thought your father was pretty clear about it.
You answer to me, and...
Well... this is what I want.
Screw you both.
Okay, but why would Lachlan want to hire Petra?
'Cause he wants to get under my skin.
- Why?
- He was actually engaged to Petra at one point.
What?
I kind of...
Stole her from him.
Oh.
Look, I was a different guy back then.
I'm reacting.
At least let me react.
Your scotch.
- Thank you.
- And some chips and our spinach-artichoke dip.
Oh, we didn't actually order anything.
They're from that couple over there.
They said it was for Jane the Virgin.
Latin lover narrator:
Uh-oh.
I'm s... uh, J...
Jane the Virgin?
Thank you.
Jane the Virgin?
What does that mean?
Well...
It's, um...
It's a web site.
Do you remember Rogelio's stepdaughters?
Yeah.
They started it to be making fun of me.
Just say it.
And the fact that I'm a virgin.
Which I am.
(Chuckles):
And now a pregnant virgin.
Huh.
So, the web site...
it went viral, and...
Now, you know, some people believe, because I'm a pregnant virgin, that I can grant miracles.
Wait, what?
I can't, just to be clear.
Uh, wow.
- A virging
- Yeah.
Wait, so you and Michael never...
- No.
- Not even after you got engaged?
No. (Chuckles)
Really?
No!
(Chuckles)
Not even...
Rafael?
I made a promise to my grandma when I was young that I would wait till marriage.
That's what I've done.
And that's still your plan?
Yes.
Definitely.
That's... that's...
That's great.
(Exhales):
Oh, yeah.
Excuse me.
You need another drink?
I'm reacting.
I can react, right?
Yeah, you're allowed to react.
- Waitress:
Another scotch?
- Uh, yes, please.
It should be noted that Michael did not react like this when she told him she was a virgin.
But that's neither here nor there.
Check that number.
Nadine: 8-3-2.
Yeah, that's it.
You realize this could be huge for us, right?
We follow this shipment, learn where Sin Rostro has been hiding.
Huge.
Okay, we got to stay focused.
- We got to stay focused.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you're right.
- Michael:
Here we go.
Look, I'm sorry I freaked out, okay?
I'm over it.
It's fine.
Fine?
Uh, you just surprised me, that's all.
Yeah, I definitely got that.
It's just, it's not something that you normally hear.
Not... no, not that you're not normal.
It's fine.
I get it.
Fine?
Yeah, fine.
Look, it's been a long day...
I just think
- we should call it a night.
- Jane...
Rafael, I'm tired.
Fine.
(Sighs)
- (Loud banging)
- What?
(Banging)
Oh!
Get down, get down.
_
Nadine:
Is that Sin Rostro?
Michael:
No way.
Sin Rostro's already in Miami, and we've got intel to back that up.
Okay, so maybe it's his new contact, whoever's taking over for Roman Zazo.
We got to go.
- Hi, babe.
- Hey.
You'll never guess who called here tonight.
Elliot Lantana.
He's an actual legitimate record producer.
He heard me sing at the club, and he wants to record a demo with me!
- That's amazing, ma.
- I know, right?
Watch out, Paulina Rubio!
- Hon?
- Hmm?
How'd it go with Rafael?
Did you tell him you're waiting?
Come on.
I got your message loud and clear.
I'm on board.
Did you tell him?
- How did he take it?
- Well.
He took it well.
Good.
Mm-hmm.
I was just so worried.
About you.
I know.
I'm sorry.
(Sighs) But how I felt about you... that's part of what I was running from.
No, I get that.
Look, here's the thing.
When I was in the sweat lodge, drinking my tea, throwing up, being guided by my shaman,
I kept... seeing your face.
It was a little distorted, but... it was you.
Luisa.
I came here to be truthful and honest.
And if I'm being truthful and honest...
I still want to be with you.
I want us to tell everyone what happened and just...
Run away together.
We can't do that.
It's over.
For real, this time.
(Long sigh)
Ah...
I had a feeling you might say that.
Regardless, we still have to tell my father what happened between us.
- What?
- My shaman thinks it's really important for me to just come clean about all my lies.
Your shaman doesn't understand the situation.
- No, he really does.
- Luisa, it will destroy my marriage.
Or make it stronger.
- (Quietly):
What are you talking about?
- Rose...
I know this is gonna be hard, but trust me, once you do it, you're gonna feel so much better.
Healthier.
Don't worry.
I'll give you time to...
To figure out how to break it to him.
Tell my father.
Or I will.
_
Woman:
Long day?
Oh, yeah.
Me, too.
(Chuckles)
The longest.
Oh, here, have mine.
I haven't touched it, I swear.
No, that's...
It's fine, thank you.
Come on, I paid 17 bucks for this thing.
I swear, this place is such a rip-off.
Thank you.
Cheers.
(Chuckles)
Oh.
(Both chuckle)
What's he doing?
Well, considering he's at the front desk getting a key... _
- I'm gonna go with checking in.
- Thanks, wiseass.
Makes sense that he's here;
this is the hub of the Sin Rostro operation.
Did you get the picture?
Yep.
Great.
I'll get it to my friend at the FBI to run face recognition.
- You trust this friend?
- Yeah, absolutely.

Man:

Here is the problem.
While you were singing, I kept wishing I was singing.
So I need you to get me out of my head.
How do I do that?
Dig deeper, Xiomara.
Dig deeper.
Oh, just one second, one second.
♪ Dig deeper, deeper, deeper. ♪
Sorry, song idea.
Get me out of my head.
Understand?
Okay, let's go from the top again.
Jane, can you take some mimosas up to room 467?
I don't do room service.
Well, you served one of our vip guests the other day, and apparently he's taken a liking to you.
To be clear, that's creepy, uh, and I'm not going into the room.
Just deliver the mimosas.
Woman:
Come on in.
Uh, where can I put this?
Oh, my...
Jane.
Jane.
Jane!
Rafael:
Jane!
Jane!
Jane!
Listen, stop.
Let me explain.
You don't have to, I get it.
I told you I was a virgin, and you had sex with the first girl you could find.
That is not true.
Okay, so then what happened?
(Stammers) I'm not sure.
What?
(Stammers)
I don't remember anything from last night.
(Scoffs)
Yeah, that's not a good explanation.
What happened last night?
Oh, you know, the usual.
Had a couple drinks, came back here.
D-did we, uh, did we have sex?
Come on, yeah.
Of course we did.
They're fake, if that's what you're wondering.
No, actually wondering what my girlfriend is doing between them.
Well, thank you so much.
This has been such a thrill.
I don't know how I can ever pay you back.
You don't need to pay me back.
When a friend asks me for a favor, I cannot refuse.
What friend?
Rogelio.
Why else do you think we did not make love in the sound booth?
It was embarrassing.
Had he even heard me sing?
Did he even see my Youtube videos?
No, he hadn't.
- But I knew once he heard you, he'd be a fan.
- Ugh.
(Electric zap) Oh, come on.
Latin lover narrator:
A spark.
Don't be angry.
It was a nice thing I did.
Wasn't it?
Yeah, it was.
So, what's our problem?
Latin lover narrator:
The fact that she desperately did not want to have feelings for him.
Nothing.
There's no problem.
Hey, aren't you teaching this afternoon?
Yeah, I have a few more minutes before I have to leave.
Oh, no.
What happened?
(Sighs)
You were right about Rafael, okay?
Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to be right.
I don't even know what I was thinking.
I mean, we're so different.
Trust me, hon, I get it.
Especially because it would have been so perfect, if it had worked out.
Yeah, it really would have.
I need to talk to you.
Is everything okay?
I don't know.
I don't know if I should say something
- or not say something.
- About what?
Your sister.
Well, then you should definitely say something.
She is having a sort of breakdown.
And I hate saying this.
But, given her history and her mother...
Rose, what happened?
I went to go see her.
To check in.
Rafael, it was awful.
The things that she was saying to me, all these... sexual things.
And I didn't know how to respond.
I didn't know what to do.
It's okay.
You did the right thing by coming to me.
Latin lover narrator:
Ooh, not nice, Rose.
All right, you know the reading assignment... the taming of the shrew.
Enjoy, and I know...
Student:
Who are you?
It's really you.
Jane the Virgin.
All right, that's enough.
Get moving!
We met this morning.
Yes, I recall.
Right.
Look, uh...
What you think happened, it didn't.
Yeah, I was there.
Something obviously happened.
No, I was paid to drug him and make it seem like we had sex.
Latin lover narrator:
Oh, is that all?
What?
I'm an escort.
Uh, my manager got me the gig.
It was all online, I don't even know who set it up.
Oh, my God.
Look, I only did it because it was easy money.
But then your boyfriend told me that you're Jane the Virgin, and I'm a really religious woman.
Which I know is hard to believe given, you know, what I do.
Anyway,
I'm really sorry.
Okay.
Thank you for telling me that.
Yeah.
So...
Can I have a hug?
Excuse me?
I could really use a miracle.
I have a son.
And I haven't seen him in a while due to a-a couple of circumstances.
I've been in some bad situations, but...
I really want to see him.
And maybe if I hug you...
I don't want to give you false hope.
I am not a religious messiah.
What happened to me was a medical mistake.
But can I give you a hug anyway?
Yeah.
I really hope you get to see your son.
(Speaking Spanish)
They don't actually give awards out to shows like this, do they?
Well, y-you can't tell anything from just one scene, okay?
There's a...
There's a larger story.
Anyway, they do give out awards, and I've actually booked the after-party here.
In the hotel.
How did you do that?
One of the divas recovered from extensive plastic surgery in one of our medical recoveco suites.
I promised that secret would never get out.
And I thought you took this job just to make Rafael squirm.
Well, the better the hotel does, the more money I make in my divorce.
It's always about money with you, isn't it?
Though setting Rafael up with that escort, that...
That seems personal.
True.
I also despise him.
And leaving you for him was the biggest mistake of my life.
Is that what you want to hear?
Well, it's true.
I should get back to my mother.
Rafael:
It had to have been Petra.
She's the only person crazy enough to set me up.
- So crazy.
- You know,
I'm just gonna expedite her settlement.
I don't want to deal with it anymore.
I want it to end and I don't want it to get in the way of... us.
What "us"?
Come on.
Last night, our dinner...
It was awful!
(Laughs) I know and I'm sorry.
I freaked out when you told me you'd never had sex.
And...
I don't know.
It was unexpected.
And I acted like an idiot.
And honestly, once I thought about it, it doesn't even matter.
You know, I'll wait as long as I have to...
- I just...
-It's not only that.
Now, look what happened when you lost your job and found out I was a virgin.
You got to cut me some slack, Jane.
- That was a tough moment.
- Yeah.
Life is full of tough moments.
You have to fight for what you want.
Look, I just think that maybe we read too much into things between us.
We're having a baby.
Let's focus on that.
Latin lover narrator:
And speaking of not working out...
So, we should nail down a date for dinner with my daughter.
Let it be known that at that moment, Xiomara prayed for a spark.
I don't think I should.
Why?
Look, you're a great guy.
And because you're a great guy,
I wanted it to work out.
So I've been ignoring the fact that there's something missing here.
What's going on?
Please... sit down, Luisa.
Who are you?
My name is Dr. Perez.
Emilio:
Try to stay calm, Luisa.
What?
What's going on?
I'm so sorry, Luisa.
I had to tell them what you were saying.
Tell them what?
About... us?
Ah... you mean our affair?
See?
Luisa?
You're having some sort of episode.
Fantasizing about me.
What?
!
What?
!
- Luisa, you got to stay calm.
- We were, we were lovers!
I don't know what happened.
Rafael:
The doctor has
- medications to give you.
- She's lying!
She's lying!
Stop lying!
I don't know what I did to trigger this...
- You didn't do anything.
- Stop lying!
The same thing happened with her mother... a psychotic break.
Stop lying!
Stop lying!
(All clamoring)
Why are you lying?
!
Why are you doing this?
!
Stop!
Stop lying!
Why are you doing this?
!
- Oh!
- Stop lying!
Please!
Liar!
Emilio:
I have no choice.
I have to commit her.
Abuela, you ready for the world premiere of mom's song?
Oh, sorry.
Whenever you're ready, we'll head to the hotel.
(Whispers):
Mom.
Is everything okay with Abuela?
She's in there with the rosary again.
- Oh.
- What is it?
It's your lawsuit.
Remember that time I forgot to pay my parking ticket?
I wasn't even thinking about how she feels about court.
If grandpa's family was so rich, why aren't we rich?
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
Why?
_
Stupid immigration laws.
_
_
_
And I get that, ma.
And I'll be more careful.
Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted that was the last ticket
Xiomara ever got.
Oh, I didn't even think.
It's just a civil procedure.
Yeah, and she knows that.
And she's fine with it.
But then Petra started acting all crazy, and the family's so powerful...
She's just nervous, that's all.
Wanted to see me?
Yeah, go ahead and shut that.
So, I've been thinking...
About how you said you made a mistake.
And I agree.
You did.
(Passionate moaning)
_
Lachlan, I-I don't...
Wait.
I'm deleting it.
I never stopped missing you.
(Cell phone dings)
I got an I.D. On the picture I sent.
The guy's a possible serbian war criminal.
What?
What the hell does a serbian have to do with Sin Rostro?
I don't know.
The guy's been awfully quiet in there.
I don't like this.
- (Phone rings) - (Sighs)
Hello?
Uh, no.
Yeah, this is Rafael.
What?
All right, I'm gonna go have Luca put this on and you guys grab a seat.
- Okay.
- Oh, Rogelio's here.
I invited him to hear it.
Since he's the one who set up the recording session.
Mm-hmm.
- Come on, ma.
- Okay.
_
_
(Speaks Spanish)
Xiomara.
So, where's Mark?
You mean Marco?
Is that not what I said?
We broke up.
But in case you were thinking it had anything to do with you...
Latin lover narrator:
It did.
And he was.
It didn't.
Just because he wasn't right doesn't mean you are.
Of course.
I agree 100%.
(Music playing)
Ah.
Is that your song?
Just beautiful.
(Petra moaning)
Latin lover narrator:
Hmm.
I guess he didn't delete it after all.
Housekeeping.
(Quietly):
Thank you.
Thank you.
He's gone.
What the hell?
Where'd he go?
Jane.
Did Petra talk to you?
- Is that why you withdrew the lawsuit?
- What?
No, I just got a...
I got a call from my lawyer saying that you withdrew.
I did, but that wasn't because of Petra.
It was... it was...
It was for my grandma.
She's not a legal resident in this country, and the whole thing was making her nervous.
And it's not only that.
I was thinking about what my lawyer said in court, about how this baby was not wanted.
And I don't feel like that anymore.
So what am I doing this for, really... for the money?
'Cause that just feels ugly.
Especially because you are absolutely going to take care of your child, financially.
Of course I am.
I'm gonna need that in writing.
Done.
Wait, wh... what was it that you thought Petra told me?
Latin lover narrator:
And so Rafael finally told Jane the truth.
I... underwrote my sister's medical malpractice insurance.
So your lawsuit...
You were actually suing me.
What?
_
_
_
I-I just didn't want to affect your decision to sue.
I had no idea.
I know.
I've also been thinking about what you told me.
About how I need to fight for things.
And you're right.
I do.
So I'm gonna work for Lachlan.
And Petra, as long as she's here.
And I'm gonna fight for you, too.
Jane, this-this is...
This is hard.
Look, we're doing everything backwards.
I mean, we're having a baby and-and then we're going on our first date?
But I want to be with you.
And I'm not giving up.
Latin lover narrator:
Oh, if only it were that easy.
_
Are you crazy?
!
No!
No!
No!
Adult Frankie:

- Yep.
I don't pay for premium channels, but you seemed really into that movie.
Do you think that would be something fun for me, you, and your mom to watch together?
No.
Are you sure?
What's it called?
"The Bikini Police."
Sounds fun, what's it about?
Uh...
I feel like the title kind of explains it.

Yeah, I need you to take a lap around the block.

Yep, a little bit.
Okay.
Look, Mom, uh, thank you so much for all the new school clothes, but I'm not so sure if this shirt is me.
It's got two sleeves and a neck hole.
It's you.
Listen, honey, that shirt is heat-sensitive, it changes colors.
I think it's a whole lot of fun.
- Oh-ho, it's so much fun.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
But what if we return it for a shirt that maybe doesn't change colors at all.
It's the first day of high school,
I'm really not trying to stand out, you know?

He's becoming a man.
He doesn't know how to deal, with these new feelings.

He does.

Adult Frankie:
Mom always knew just how to push Dad's buttons.
Um, they escape from the island, and both the kids live.
You're welcome.
Jack, what were you thinking with Frankie?
He's 16 years old, and my job is to make sure he doesn't get a girl pregnant or drink and drive, which, by the way, is not an issue, because he's terrified of getting behind the wheel.
Otherwise, nothing he does at this age matters.
If something matters to Frankie, it should matter to you.
Same goes with Rachel.
Have you even spoken to Doug before today?
It's irrelevant.
Did you even punish her?
She's grounded.
I figure for shirt off, three days.
Pants off, it would have been a week.
What if, she gets pregnant?
Two weeks, no TV.
I don't know.
Honey, you've got to get in the game more, they think you don't care.
I love those damn kids.
I may not always like them, but name one parent who would hang out with their kids if they weren't their kids.

I don't think they like, being called bitches, dude.
Good.
You know what?
This is too much pressure.
I don't want to go to this party.
I'm out.
- Are you serious?
- I don't want to talk about it.
Talk about what?
Uh, nothing.
You'd think it was stupid.
I think everything everyone says is stupid.
Tell me anyway.
A hot girl invited Frankie to a party, but he won't go.

George got stabbed by one of those hobos you robbed.
You've got to get him to the hospital before he bleeds out.

If you close your eyes, can you still remember kissing that girl?
Yeah, I guess.
Well, I've kissed hundreds of girls.

She was sloppy.

Do you have proof you didn't?
Do you?
Get in.

Stop him!
You have the right to remain silent, but it's better if you don't.
Your words can be used against you in the court, but it's better if you spill everything.
You have right to a lawyer, but you'll still get to eat jail food.
Oh...
One more thing.
If you can't find yourself a lawyer, the government will find you one.
Why?
Republic of Korea is a good country.
And I'm... a cop in this country.
Take him.
I told you to leave him alone.
Why did we go look for him at the hotel?
Can't you keep quiet?
We only went looking for him.
Alright, alright.
Everyone calm down.
To summarize, the dead Hwang Dong Bae wounded you.
So you went to pay him back for that?
Yes, we did go there but didn't meet him.
Was it the Security Team Director?
We were kicked out by that guy.
Then why were you in hiding all this time?
I mean, really... the guy deserved to die.
Why are we being hassled?
You're talking casual to me.
Are you speaking casually to me?
Ugh, damn it.
We did go to the hotel the next day to get him, but we saw him fall from the ceiling as a corpse.
The circumstance looked as though we might take the blame for it, so... we just ran away.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Everything will come out with our investigation!
What will you do if you don't believe us?
Why can't you keeper of the law believe us good citizens?

Nothing was captured on CCTV on the day of the incident.
So, I got one month worth of recordings.
- A month?
- Yes.
I wondered if there were any suspicious activities beforehand.
And look...
This is from August 23rd, the day of the incident.
And this is from July 23rd.
A recording from a month ago.
What's this?
It's exactly the same.
When I closely examined it, it was actually from July 23rd, not August 23rd.
Get a close up.
Then... the suspect is inside the hotel?
Someone intentionally erased the recording.
Oh, boy...
Our elite detective will be greatly disappointed.
Honey.
I'm a total elite.
I captured all the suspects.
I caught them all.

I guess raspberry juice doesn't work.

Weren't we?
Yes, right.
Not weak, but strong.
Hae Young, I'm here.
Why are you here again?
What's with your outfit?
I have something to confirm.
- How is it?
- What?
Don't you feel anything?
Do you have dirt in your toenails?
How should I feel?
How about now?
What are you doing?
You really don't feel anything?
Get down.
I guess this can't cure it.
I feel like crying.
Goo Hae Young.
I will really forget you.
Instead... be sure to see a doctor.

But... why do you look so gloomy for someone who accomplished so much?
I guess this time was a little tough.
I'll get going now.
Well, General Manager.
Did you, by chance have a woman you loved?
Wow... that question came from nowhere.
I was wondering if the memory of love fades with one's own effort.
Never mind.
I'll get going.
Yeo Eun Joo, wait for me.
Oh, my!

Oh, sorry.
I didn't hear you.

Did you think about us dating?
What is that supposed to mean?
I asked Nam Sang Hyo to date me.

You go ahead.
I left something behind, too.
See you later.
Nam Sang Hyo!
Nam Sang Hyo!
Where did she go?
Why are you doing this to me?
Because you're pretty.
Why else?
Honey... you can't be offended over this.
But rather...
Look at me.
You should realize, "I'm really pretty."
Think that.
You should like it.
I don't like it one bit.
You looked pretty working so hard, so I patted you.
Why are you overreacting?
Don't you know how much influence I have over HR?
If you want to work... comfortably...
You'd better move that hand.

Do you really want a gift?
A gift?
What gift?
Electronic ankle bracelet.
Electronic ankle bracelet?
What do you take me for?
Apologize to Byon Ji Ae immediately.
Manager Nam.
What makes you so outspoken?
Just because the General Manager and Managing Director Jo call you, "Future of the hotel,"
can't you see straight?
Vice General Manager.
That's right, I'm the Vice General Manager.
How dare you stare at me like that?
The ethics committee meeting that got pushed back because of the wedding incident...
I'll request for its immediate assembly.
You should be prepared this time.
Oh, I'm so scared.
I'm really scared.
Be prepared.
Nam Sang Hyo!
Stop right there!
Hey!
She's scared of Yeo Eun Joo, but not me?
That little...
Have you seen Cha Dong Min?
Excuse me.
Wait.
Please take care of my back.
Excuse me.
What is it?
Do you know where I can find Cha Dong Min?
Why do you ask me that?
Who else would I ask?
What?
How can I help you?
All the CCTV recordings here are moved and stored in an archive around 8pm every evening.
If that's the case... it means someone switched the recording.
Who is permitted to enter the storage archive?
Managing Director Jo Sung Gyum.
The General Manager.
The Vice General Manager.
And myself since I move the recordings.
Only four of us.
So, the recording from that day... was moved by you?
Yes.
That's what I do on a daily basis.
Well...
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
I saw the Vice General Manager coming out of the storage archive.
What?
After discovering the body of Assistant Manager Hwang, everyone was at the wedding hall.
Why the Vice General Manager came out of the archive instead of the wedding hall...
I was wondering about that.
Jeez...
I'm telling you.
It's not me.
I didn't do it.
Wait.
I'm telling you it's not me.
Let's go talk at the station.
You're grabbing me.
Jeez!
Do you think the Vice General Manager killed Assistant Manager Hwang?
We don't know that.
You can't tell a person by his appearance.
Nam Sang Hyo.
See me.
Ugh...
Let go of this.
No.
You'll run away again.
I won't.
I won't run away.
Managing Director.
Where do you think you're going?
Come here.
Come here.
Hurry up.
Is that true?
What?
Managing Director Jo asking you to date him.
Probably?
So, what did you say?
I didn't give him an answer yet.
Hey, Nam Sang Hyo.
You shouldn't keep quiet but tell him no.
Why not?
Don't you know why?
Because I like him.
It must be nice keeping everything so simple.
Yeah...
Hey.
Where do you think you're going?
So, are you going to date him?
Aren't you going to tell me?
Tell me if you're going to date him or not.
Do you like the dress?
Yes.
I think it looks good on my gorgeous body.
Your dress last time looked great on you, too.
How can I wear the same dress from last time?
That would be bad luck.
You threw away a dress you only wore once.
You must really have a lot of money.
Do I look like I can't afford that?
Bride.
Do you want to change?
No.
I want to show it to oppa before I change.
Then... to review other things on the list,
I'll go find Manager Nam.
Sure.
Please hold the train of the dress so I won't drag it.
Sure.
Why isn't he here yet?
Please give me some earl grey tea.
More than that... look at this.
What is this?
My friend who looks like you.
What... it's me.
Oh... it is you then.
What?
When did you take it?
Where is this...
That's right.
I took it in Hong Kong last month.
This is the original.
And this is... the enlargement of your photo.
I didn't know it then but... there are several pictures of you and me in it together.
So?
Among those pictures,
I enlarged your photos only.
Here.
What is it you want?
How much do you want?
For every picture... the price of your wedding dress.
Are you crazy?
Do you know how much this dress costs?
You look like you can afford at least that much.
Can't you?
What is it you want to say?
Hurry up.
Jung Soo Ah is waiting for you.
Will you date him?
Will you date Jo Sung Gyum?
There's no reason for me not to date a man like him.
Then why couldn't you answer her right away?
How much did you eavesdrop?
I didn't eavesdrop.
I could hear everything.
Sang Hyo.
By chance...
- do you have feelings for me...
- Not at all.
Nothing?
Just because... if I said yes right away,
I didn't want to look easy.
That's why.
Then... let's go, client.
We should wrap up your wedding preparation.
Hurry, let's go.
We're still early.
I thought we were always running late!
Is something wrong?
It's your fault.
It's all your fault.
What's wrong?
Did something happen?
I don't want to be here.
Let's go.
What...
She just left?
Yes.
Something urgent came up.
She said to... discuss the rest with the groom.
Where did she go without telling me?
Well... she must have a story she can't tell.
Don't worry too much.
Then...
I'll go down first.
Did you hear?
What?
The Vice General Manager got arrested.
Why?
For sexual harassment?
No.
It wasn't that.
The Vice General Manager is...
Assistant Manager Hwang's murder suspect.
Good.
I hate him anyway.
Gi Chul.
Don't spread rumors you can't confirm.
Okay.
I didn't mean to...
Anyway...
I wish the detective would stop coming around.
Why?
Did you do something wrong?
What do you mean?
I'm just... thinking of the work atmosphere.
Anyway... you shouldn't live with a crime.
Whether it's a sexual harasser or ...a murderer.
As a human being... you should live a decent life.
Why are you smiling?
Did I say something wrong?
Whatever you say, I'm not the one.
Why would I kill Assistant Manager Hwang?
Why did you erase the CCTV recording then?
I can't tell you.
Then I can't let you go.
Ugh, I'm going crazy!
Ugh, I'm going crazy!
Fine.
But as far as this is concerned... it has nothing to do with this incident and you can't tell the hotel.
Alright, let me hear you first.
So...
Well...
Female employees these days...
They don't know how to appreciate a superior when I show them favor.
For patting them on the hips for doing a job well done, they call me, Kim Soo Bok such an ugly name.
A sexual harasser.
You pat their hips?
Yes.
Not hard...
Gently...
Gently?
Yes.
And Manager Nam happened to see it.
That?
You have no evidence.
They're framing me.
What should I do now?
There's evidence now.
She was babbling on about evidence and whatnot.
At any given chance I would be misunderstood.
Misunderstood?
Depending on the angle... it's easy to be misunderstood.
I was feeling uneasy anyhow.
I saw everyone running out to the hall where Assistant Manager Hwang died.
I figured it was good timing.
Even if I erased it, no one will notice.
I'm telling you I didn't do it.
Never.
Okay.
Alright.
But I can't release you now.
The day of Assistant Manager Hwang's death, we'll confirm your alibi as you told us.
After that we'll let you go.
Hey, Elite.
Yes.
Escort this man to a jail cell.
Do it gently.
Wait.
Detective.
Detective, what did I do wrong?
Ugh, wait!
The Vice General Manager?
Yes.
Fortunately, you won't have to worry about the CCTV.
But still... we should be careful until they wrap up the investigation.
Yes.
I thought getting rid of Hwang Dong Bae would be the end of it.
The dead Hwang Dong Bae is still haunting me.
There's something we need to take care of.
This one is... an elegant and classic concept.
And this one is... a modern and chic concept.
Finally, this one... we focused on a luxurious feel.
You saw all seven concepts.
Let's pick whatever.
Can't you find what you like?
No.
Pick whichever one you like, Nam Sang Hyo.
Then... should we decide on flowers first?
The flowers determine the look and feel.
If you pick out flowers you like,
I'll recommend a concept to fit your choice of flowers.
Assistant Manager Yang, give me the flower photos.
Okay.
Here you go.
Are you sick, Assistant Manager Yang?
Well...
I don't feel too good.
You should've told me sooner.
I'm sorry.
Go home.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Can you go home by yourself?
Of course.
I'll see you on your wedding day.
Okay.
What...
Are you sick?
No...
I'm okay.
Did you decide on your flowers?
Let me make a recommendation.
Never mind.
Just pick anything.
Pick the ones you like.
I don't care.
It's not my wedding.
It's yours.
Tell me what type of wedding you want rather than regretting it later.
How about this?
Instead of an extravagant dress, the bride wears a clean and down-to-earth one piece dress.
In her hands, rather than pre-made bouquet she holds a few flowers she likes...
We would drive along and... stop by a small church we liked.
Without any guests... without any music... just two hearts...
But we didn't work out.
Do it right this time.
I'll give you something to drink.
Is coffee okay?
Don't worry about coffee.
You take care of our wedding.
Get a grip, Nam Sang Hyo.
He's going to marry another woman.
Are you okay, Nam Sang Hyo?
Sang Hyo.
What do I do?
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
What to do...
- Your shirt is wet.
- I'm okay.
What should I do?
Your clothes are wet.
I'll launder your clothes for you.
Never mind my clothes... give me some of your time.
Just one hour.
No, just thirty minutes.
I have to tell you something.
I must tell you before this day ends.
I'm sorry.
I'll take care of your wedding for you.
Wait.
I'll wait.
Come to the parking lot.
We must be crazy.
Should we just forget about it?
I, Goo Hae Young... vow to marry Nam Sang Hyo.
I, Nam Sang Hyo... vow to marry Goo Hae Young.
Why?
Why are you doing this, Nam Sang Hyo?
What's wrong with you?
Nam Sang Hyo...
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Yes.
Nam Sang Hyo.
What's going on?
I... was married seven years ago.
What?
I fell in love with him the moment I met him.
I loved him and married him because I didn't want to part with him.
But it didn't work out.
86 days...
No, we lived 87 days together and split...
I was married before.
I loved him to death and hated him to death.
I tried so hard it nearly killed me.
So that it wouldn't kill me, I erased it from my memory.
We showed our worst to each other.
I thought I had nothing more left in me.
But I keep going back to the time I escaped from.
I know it's wrong to do that in my head.
But I keep going back.
Sang Hyo.
Why are you telling me this?
Are you pressured by what I said about dating?
No.
Because you should know.
Managing Director.
Would you date me?
Even if I'm a divorcee, can you date me?
Nam Sang Hyo.
I had my first love, too.
Your past is not a problem for me.
Even if that past is right in front of me?
My ex-husband is Goo Hae Young.
What...
What?
The wedding I'm preparing.
I don't like weddings.
You know... someone is getting married... but I'm preparing the wedding.
Can I ask you why you were crying?
My friend... was married seven years ago.
She loved him to death but... they split in less than one hundred days.
Nam Sang Hyo.
You really make me out to be an idiot.
How can you hide something like that?
I take back what I said about waiting for your answer.
What you said about asking me to date you I'll disregard it.
And from this moment on we're dating.
Don't ever make me out to be an idiot and endure by yourself.
Thank you for telling me.
And for dating me.
Go in and rest well tonight.
Okay.
You, too, Managing Director.
Goodnight.
Nam Sang Hyo.
Can you smile for me tomorrow?
Only then, I'd feel like I helped.
Goodnight, Nam Sang Hyo.
Give me your credit card.
I want to get the money to pay for your drinks first and then listen.
I left it in my car.
I'm leaving.
Bye.
What is it now?
I have a favor.
What?
Stay with me tonight.
What?
Hey.
You...
What are you talking about?
Why would I spend the night with you tonight?
If you don't...
I feel like I'll go to her.
Who's that?
That woman?
Hey.
You met her again?
Yeah.
Dude...
Why are you meeting her when your wedding is right in front of you?
- You told me I should.
- I just said that.
So...
I got rejected.
There was something I wanted to tell her.
But she didn't want to hear it.
She has her head on straight.
Right?
She must do that to a man who's about to get married.
Si Chan.
Should I really get married?
Of course you should.
Why are you saying that now?
I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing.
Goo Hae Young.
What did I tell you?
When you said you're marrying Soo Ah,
I told you to think it through.
When were you ever a good son?
Why would you marry for your father?
What can I do?
He refused his heart surgery unless I get married.
Then...
"Go ahead, Father.
Go ahead and pass away."
"I don't have thoughts of marriage no matter what happens to you."
- Should I have said that?
- So...
So, do it.
Can your father forget about the surgery now, huh?
Nothing has changed.
That woman appeared in front of me.
Goo Hae Young.
I figured all women were the same unless it was her.
Whoever I marry...
I don't care.
Even if you feel this way, you said she rejected you.
Soo Ah is more than enough.
She's pretty and from a great family.
On top of that... she's crazy about you.
Come to your senses.
You're getting married in two days.
No, I want to be with you.
The Chairman will worry.
Don't worry.
I'll tell him I was with my friends.
How about if I get in trouble for not taking care of you?
Are you that scared of my dad?
Are you that scared?
You know me.
Once I get married, being together like this is over.
We can't deceive others after getting married.
Once I get married,
I'll be faithful to Hae Young oppa.
I'll forget you then and will live as a loving wife.
Soo Ah.
So, let's stay together.
We don't have much time left.
I should've stayed with Si Chan.
Why am I here again?
Goodnight Nam Sang Hyo.
What am I thinking right now?
This is the last time I see her like this.
I'll see you at the wedding, Nam Sang Hyo.
Alright then...
Please applaud for the groom who is about to begin his beautiful destiny.
Groom..
...enter.
Next... star of the day... the beautiful bride will make her entrance.
Bride enter.
I wish a dead body would fall.
Does the groom, Goo Hae Young take the bride, Jung Soo Ah as a lawful wedded wife and vow to always love, respect and be together forever?
Groom...
Oppa.
Groom...
Groom...
Oppa...
I do.
Do you the bride, Jung Soo Ah...
Do you promise?
I do.
Now...
In front of all your guests, I pronounce you husband and wife.
This is it.
Goo Hae Young.
Goo Hae Young.
Goo Hae Young.
Goo Hae Young.
Hey, Goo Hae Young.
Wake up.
Drink this.
Did you spend the night here?
How can you be like this now?
Why?
It's your wedding day.
Ugh, dude...
I thought you were okay.
How can you forget your own wedding?
It's the day my nightmare becomes reality.
Hurry.
Wake up.
We still have time.
Hey...
Are you going to get married looking like this?
Take a shower and you should shave.
You have to change, too.
I'll do that at home.
No, no, no...
I talked to the hotel.
Go change there.
Take a shower there.
Shave there, too.
Why?
Soo Ah called.
She asked me to take you to the hotel and make you look good.
Put this over there.
Mic testing.
Manager Nam.
Are you okay?
Yes.
You look anxious.
It's an important wedding.
I must be nervous.
Leave it to me.
Come back after you take a break.
There's still a lot of time.
Groom
- Goo Hae Young.
Bride
- Jung Soo Ah.
Oh, yeah.
I left the ring in the car.
Really?
Why didn't you just lose it?
You...
You go ahead.
I'll meet you there.
Don't try to sneak out.
Now?
Wait...
You went through a lot.
Yes.
Congratulations on your wedding.
Good-bye.
Goo Hae Young.
Good-bye.
Nam Sang Hyo.
Nam Sang Hyo.
There was no need to congratulate me.
Oppa isn't answer his phone.
You know I love you, right?
Jung Soo Ah...
Why did I have to meet her again?
Are you out of your mind?
This must be fate.
I really prepared for a perfect wedding.
- It's weird.
- What?
Something is strange.
Are you crazy?
The wedding we couldn't have before let's do it right this time.
Let's get married, Sang Hyo.
Previously on Teen Wolf.
SCOTT:
Whoa.
I look like a demon from hell.
It doesn't look like a demon to me.
It looks like a fox.
RAFAEL:
Barrow was hiding in the chemistry closet.
Someone left him a message on the blackboard telling him to kill Kira.
They came out of the shadows.
One of them, I could see his eyes, like a firefly.
Dad, do you know what that means?
CHRIS:
I think they might have been after me.
SCOTT:
His eyes were glowing.
There was something almost ritualistic about it.
Like it was looking right into his soul.
That's the same thing it did to me.
That's what it did to everyone.
Not everyone.
They only came after the werewolves.
And Lydia.
Anyone with a connection to the supernatural.
Then who was the guy they went after in Japan?
A kumicho.
A yakuza boss.
It was my first gun deal.
I was only 18 and it was supposed to be a simple exchange.
Except Gerard left out the minor detail of the buyers being yakuza.
He wanted to see if I could adapt in the moment.
Testing my ability to improvise.
ALLISON:
Or your ability to survive.
The moment the sun went down it was like they just materialized out of the shadows.
They had swords, not curved like katanas but straight, black steel.
Like ninjatos.
SCOTT:
What did they want?
CHRIS:
To get to the kumicho.
(GUNFIRE)
CHRIS:
They cut down every living thing in their way.
Did they mark him like they did us?
Not exactly.
(GUNFIRE)
(GROWLS)
(SHRIEKING)
SCOTT:
What was he?
I don't know.
But there might be someone who does.
There were a few others who survived that night.
One of them was a man named Katashi...
They called him Silverfinger because of an unusual prosthetic.
And it looked like he was getting ready to take them all on himself.
(GUNSHOT)
I've known for a while Katashi was in the country.
I spent yesterday tracking him down.
Didn't look like he wanted to be found.
Not particularly, no.
You think he knows what they are?
Or what they want?
Maybe.
What if he doesn't want to talk?
ISAAC:
What if he doesn't even remember you?
He'll remember this.
(GUNSHOT)
I know I didn't kill it.
I'm not sure you can.
But I slowed it down long enough for us to get out of there.
What was behind the mask?
CHRIS:
Darkness...
Absolute darkness.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(DOOR CREAKING)
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
You okay?
So all of your friends are...
Yeah.
And you're a...
Yeah.
(SIGHS)
Can I see?
Are you sure?
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(ENGINES REV)
You guys going to be doing this all day?
- All day.
- All night.
Is this about being in my pack?
This is about you being the target of demonic ninjas.
You mean the demonic ninjas that pulled swords out of their chests and completely kicked our asses?
Yeah.
Those demonic ninjas.
I don't need anyone to protect me.
They were looking right at you when the sun came up.
And they also disappeared.
Argent thinks that they could just come out at night.
Since this is our first experience with demonic ninjas, we're thinking we should play it safe.
All day.
And all night.
Okay, one thing first.
I need to talk to Stiles and let him know everything that happened last night.
Without you.
- No.
- Yes.
And I don't want you listening in.
No wolf hearing.
How would you even know?
I'm a true Alpha.
You have no idea what I can do.
So then she starts talking about phosphors and the key having chemicals on it, right?
And so that made me think of the chemistry closet and the fact that someone had to let Barrow in...
It's gone.
Okay, it doesn't matter though.
It doesn't matter.
I've still got the key.
(WHISPERS) What the hell?
I had it...
I had it here.
I had it here this morning, I swear to God, I had it this morning.
The key you were talking about last night?
Yeah, I showed it to you, right?
Didn't I show it to you?
No, you just told me about it.
I never actually saw it.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I was here a couple of hours ago.
And the message left to Barrow spelling Kira's name was right there on the board in my handwriting and I had the key to the chemistry closet.
So you unlocked the chemistry closet so Barrow could hide in it from the cops and then you wrote him a message to kill Kira?
I know how it sounds...
But look at this.
This is the news report that came out about Barrow when they caught him, okay?
About the shrapnel bomb that he used.
See this?
See what he did?
He put nuts, bolts and screws.
And then he hid the bomb and the detonator in a box that he wrapped as a birthday present.
What does that sound like to you?
Coach.
The joke we played on Coach.
STILES:
That was my idea.
You remember?
That was my idea.
That's no coincidence.
It can't be.
I don't want to sound like I'm trying to tell you that you're wrong.
But I don't think you're trying to kill people either.
It was here.
It was all here.
Dude, are you feeling okay?
You're looking really tired.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just haven't been sleeping really...
Why don't you go home?
Take a sick day or something.
Did you tell him?
No.
He's got enough on his mind right now.
If they're coming for you in a few hours then so do you.
What if it's not me?
Okay?
What if I'm not the one they want?
Who else is there?
The real problem is Katashi doesn't see visitors.
Ever.
He's a paranoid recluse who rarely steps outside the gates of his estate.
So how are you going to get to him?
Oh, he's got a thing for rare, antique weapons.
Yesterday, I had some contacts put out the word that I was selling one from my own collection.
This is a French Flintlock Turnover Pistol from 1645.
You're not going alone.
If she's going I'm going.
To be honest, I don't feel good about bringing either one of you.
They were looking right at Scott when the sun came up.
Well, that doesn't necessarily mean he's the one they're going after.
But if he is?
If he is, that might only leave us till nightfall to come up with a way to protect him.
All right.
Let's go see if a paranoid yakuza wants to put another gun in his collection.
Yeah, I'm walking in now.
And trying to avoid the hostile stares of everyone in here.
No, no.
(BEEPS)
Probably another week or two and we'll be ready for a formal review.
There's enough here to put Stilinski so far out of government work, he won't be able to get a job riding the back of a garbage truck.
Yeah, exactly.
Let me call you right back.
MELISSA:
Dr. Gardner's not back until next week.
Do you want to try waiting for one of the urgent care doctors or...
Stiles.
Are you all right?
(SHAKILY) I don't know.
I guess...
I guess not really.
All right, kiddo.
All right.
Come with me.
It's okay.
Blackouts.
But not for that long.
And sleepwalking, which I used to do a lot as a kid.
Um...
Also having some really bad anxiety.
Panic attacks?
Yeah, a couple.
Oh, and I temporarily lost the ability to read.
But that might have had more to do with this giant magic tree and a whole human sacrifice thing.
I recall something vaguely about that, yes.
How many hours of sleep are you getting?
Eight.
A night?
In the last three days.
Yeah, definitely eight.
Been feeling irritable?
Yeah.
Possibly to the point of homicide.
Inability to focus?
No, the Adderall's not working.
Impulsive behavior?
More than my usual?
Hard to tell.
Vivid dreams during the day?
Okay, basically all of the above.
Do you know what this is?
I think so.
Uh, what's that?
Do you trust me?
When you're not holding a needle.
(CHUCKLES)
It's Midazolam.
A sedative.
Why'd you give me a sedative?
Because you, Stiles, are one profoundly sleep-deprived young man.
You need rest and you need it now.
Lie down.
Okay, how long's it take to...
Oh.
Not long at all.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(SOFTLY) Get some rest.
(WHISPERS) Thanks, Mom.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
What is it?
Katashi won't do the buy in person.
But he's a paranoid recluse.
Shouldn't you be a little less surprised?
I was trying to remain optimistic that we wouldn't have to go to my Plan B.
Plan B?
And what's Plan B?
How tall are you?
(CAR BEEPS)
Guys, I appreciate you wanting to protect me.
But I have to be alone for a bit.
So...
Sorry about this.
(ENGINE REVS) (ENGINES STALL)
What do I do with these?
CHRIS:
Katashi's office is here.
ISAAC:
Guys.
(STAMMERING) This isn't going to work.
I look ridiculous.
I mean...
I look like I just stepped out of the last period of a Catholic prep school.
And there is no way that I'm going be able to remember all this.
I mean, what does this even mean?
"Revolving over and under barrels?"
(SIGHS)
All you have to do is keep them talking long enough to allow us to get inside and find Katashi.
He may not be there for the buy in person but...
He won't be far.
You look great.
I am sweating, all the way through my jacket.
I didn't even know that I could sweat this much.
Give me a second.
You can do this.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
You're not a boy if you walk in there acting like a man.
Okay?
Go in there with confidence and all they'll see is a boyish looking man.
Or a stupid teenager pretending to be a man.
I'm going to get my head blown off by a bunch of Japanese fingerless mobsters...
(MUSIC PLAYING)
How do you feel now?
Gentlemen.
I believe Mr. Katashi is expecting me.
KINCAID:
I'm expecting you.
(SCRAPING)
(METAL REVERBERATING)
- Could you lock the door?
- Yeah.
(EXHALES DEEPLY) We're running out of time.
I know.
But Allison, her dad and Isaac are working on something that could help.
I don't want to sound pessimistic or anything, but you really think that's going to keep them out?
Actually, we have a kind of security system.
Things happened a couple of weeks ago, a lot of things, and we had my boss help make a few changes to the house.
Your boss?
Do you work for a security company or something?
No, he's a veterinarian.
You had a vet put in your alarm?
Yeah, sort of.
But I can't arm it.
Only my mom can.
Where's she?
Don't worry.
She'll be here.
Oh!
Sorry.
We're going to be okay.
I promise.
We?
Or me?
All of us.
You didn't bring the twins here because you didn't want them to get hurt.
I don't want anyone getting hurt.
Then why did you bring me?
If those things are coming after you, and anyone who gets in the way gets killed, then shouldn't I be somewhere else?
I'm not letting you get hurt.
And I don't want you getting hurt.
Especially because of me.
It could be either of us.
I don't think so.
I have to show you something.
Have you ever heard of something called a kitsune?
(WOMAN ON PA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
"Patient is irritable, impulsive,
"complaints of vivid dreams.
Inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality,
"acute insomnia."
(GROANS)
What we're looking at here is a mint-condition French Flintlock Turnover Pistol crafted in the mid-17th century.
It was a gift from Louis XIV to a prominent French family.
It's only ever been fired once.
During a duel between brothers on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles.
(STUTTERING) So you're familiar with it.
Oh, Mr. Katashi knows what he wants.
We'll take it.
$150,000.
I'm gonna need to count it.
Oh, really?
(WHISPERS) Yeah.
That looks like what happened to you at the power station.
When a kitsune rubs its tails together it can create fire or lighting.
It's called foxfire.
I don't have any tails.
(SCOFFS) How'd you know what I was thinking?
Because kitsune are also psychic.
I can hear all of your thoughts.
Just kidding.
The sun's setting.
Ah.
Yeah, I know.
Are you scared?
Not right now.
I'm supposed to be back before dinner.
Tell them you can't make it.
What should I say?
(SOFTLY) Say, uh, you're going on a date.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
You know, foxes and wolves don't really get along.
That's just a drawing.
In a children's book.
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
My mom's back.
What are you doing here?
And why do you still have a key?
Funny you mention keys.
Because while I have a key to this house,
I'm not exactly sure how you got a key to my office.
You don't know the whole story behind this gun, do you?
There was no duel between brothers.
That was the cover story.
The real one involves an encounter in the woods with a vicious animal.
Its bite caused one of the men to change into something... (CLICKS TONGUE) Monstrous.
By his family's code, the brother of this man killed him with this very gun.
Well, that is certainly better than the version that I heard.
I'm gonna trust you guys with the money here and, uh...
Personally, I'd like to hear your story.
(GROWLS)
(GROWLING)
All I want to do is talk.
Taking out my security is not what I would call a good conversation starter.
You don't remember me, do you?
Allison, take the man's gun.
Now, can we talk?
ISAAC:
Guys?
They have a werewolf too.
Let me help you out here.
This kind of thing usually begins with something along the lines of,
"It's not what you think." Or, "I can explain."
Dad, let me help you out.
You need to leave.
I will.
With a satisfactory explanation.
- Go get a warrant.
- I don't need a warrant.
I'm your father.
No, you're a gene donor.
I got my hair color from you.
And that's all I got.
So you're not allowed to play tough dad with me.
Hey, what's going on?
Maybe one of you should explain.
Scott...
Who the hell is this?
SCOTT:
Dad, no!
Dad, wait... (GROANS) (SCREAMS)
SCOTT:
Dad.
(GROWLS)
(GROWLING)
(SNARLING)
(GROWLING)
Mom, the ash!
(SNARLING)
(BOTH GROWLING)
Mom, now!
Do it now!
Starting to remember?
It was 24 years ago.
(GASPS)
CHRIS:
You know what they are, don't you?
They're called oni.
They are demons.
And they are unstoppable.
All of the baseboards are ash wood?
Uh, yeah.
It was Deaton's idea.
And where the hell did you come from?
I've been following you.
For how long?
All day.
Scott, this isn't good!
(GASPING) Need to call for backup.
How bad is it?
From the way that his arm is rotated, the tendon looks torn.
He could be on his way to a collapsed lung.
Mom, those things, they're not going to leave until the sun's up.
At the rate he's bleeding, he's not gonna make it that long.
We got to get him to the hospital.
Should we call Stiles's Dad?
I don't know.
Is that going to just get more people hurt?
Maybe.
I don't think guns work on them.
Then what does?
Nothing.
At least no man-made weapon.
The oni are a force of nature.
You don't fight a tsunami.
You endure it.
And you hope that you're not destroyed in its path.
Then how do we endure it?
One of you already has.
This is Japanese kanji for "self".
This means he is still himself.
The oni are looking for one who is no longer themselves.
What do you mean no longer themselves?
Possessed.
By a dark spirit.
It's Kira, right?
You going to tell us what you are?
What?
What do you mean?
Aiden...
Watch!
(GRUNTS)
See that?
She can't go through it either.
So, what are you?
She's a kitsune, idiot.
Use your eyes.
You can see it all around her.
The younger ones give off an aura.
She just hasn't learned how to conceal it yet.
She probably doesn't know what kind she is either.
There are 13 kinds of kitsune.
Celestial, wild, ocean, thunder.
But there is one, a dark kitsune.
They call it void.
Or nogitsune.
A kumicho.
That's right.
He was possessed by a nogitsune.
It's what helped him rise through the ranks of our yakuza family.
Nogitsune draws its power from pain and tragedy, strife and chaos.
It's not you.
It can't be.
What I saw around you, it didn't look evil.
But isn't that what a shape-shifter does?
Isn't that why a kitsune is called the trickster spirit?
It's supposed to trick you.
How are you so sure?
How do you know I'm not the bad guy?
SCOTT:
I've seen the bad guys.
And you're not one of them.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
Not yet.
Why do you think we're here, Derek?
For a study group?
We're here to protect Scott.
We're trying to fight for him.
I'm sure you are.
I'm sure you'd kill for him.
But are you willing to die for him?
Do you know why I'm missing this finger?
Penance.
There's a ritual called yubitsume.
Removing the joints of the little finger weakens your grip on a sword.
When a katana is gripped properly, the little finger is the strongest.
Why did they take your finger?
They didn't take it.
A yakuza performs the ritual himself and offers it to his superior.
It was penance for a mistake.
And it wasn't my only one...
I don't know what it was about the way I moved or stood that suggested to them that I was going to take them on.
Because actually I was...
Preparing to run for my life.
(GUNSHOT) That shot you fired saved me from looking like a coward before the survivors.
For that humiliation, I wouldn't have to have given up my finger.
I would've had to give up my head.
I wish I could give you the answer you need, Mr. Argent.
I owe you more than my life.
I owe you my honor.
I will tell you one thing, however.
If there is a nogitsune among you...
Let the oni destroy it.
Even if it is your own daughter.
(RUMBLING)
SCOTT:
What are they doing?
Testing for weaknesses.
Guys?
We have a problem.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(WEAKLY) I need to speak to Scott.
You're kidding, right?
Don't patronize me...
Melissa.
You know why...
You know why I really came back, don't you?
And as usual your timing sucks.
You're not talking to him.
Not like this.
So, you stay awake and we're gonna get you out of here as fast as we can.
Allison, please tell me that you have something.
They're here.
They're trying to get in.
And it looks like they're gonna' be able to do it.
ALLISON:
Okay, okay listen.
They're Japanese demons.
They're called the oni.
They're looking for someone possessed.
Someone with a dark spirit attached to them.
A nogitsune.
How'd you know that?
Scott?
Just...
Tell me what else.
ALLISON:
Okay, they won't hurt you.
They know you're supernatural but once they do this check, once they realize that you're not carrying with you this dark spirit, then they won't hurt you, I promise.
All they're looking for is the nogitsune.
I'm right, aren't I?
They're looking for me.
They're looking for a dark spirit.
And I know it's not you.
Scott, we're going to have to do something.
Don't do anything.
Is he serious?
(SNARLING)
I said don't do anything.
Trust me.
(GASPS)
ETHAN:
You're gonna be okay.
Melissa?
Hey, stab wound to the left chest.
Possible collapsed lung.
Pulse is weak.
I'll find Stiles.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(SNARLING)
(BREATHING RAPIDLY)
(THUD)
Stiles?
You okay?
Yeah, fine.
What's been going on?
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Kira:
Previously on teen wolf...
(music playing)
Scott:
Whoa.
I look like a demon from hell.
It doesn't look like a demon to me.
It looks like a fox.
Rafael:
Barrow was hiding in the chemistry closet.
Someone left him a message on the blackboard telling him to kill kira.
One of them, I could see his eyes, like a firefly.
Chris:
I think they might have been after me.
Scott:
His eyes were glowing.
There was something almost ritualistic about it.
Like it was looking right into his soul.
That's the same thing it did to me.
That's what it did to everyone.
Not everyone.
They only came after the werewolves.
And lydia.
Anyone with a connection to the supernatural.
Then who was the guy they went after in japan?
A kumicho.
A yakuza boss.
It was my first gun deal.
Except gerard left out the minor detail of the buyers being yakuza.
He wanted to se if I could adat in the moment.
Testing my ability to improvise.
Allison:
Or your ability to survive.
The moment the sun went down
It was like they just materialized out of the shadows.
They had swords, not curved like katanas
But straight, black stee.
Like ninjatos.
Scott:
What did they want?
Chris:
To get to the kumicho.
(gunfire)
Chris:
They cut down every living thing in their way.
Did they mark him like they did us?
Not exactly.
(gunfire)
(growls)
(shrieking)
Scott:
What was he?
I don't know.
But there might be someone who does.
There were a few others who survived that night.
One of them was a man named katashi...
They called him silverfingr because of an unusual prosthetic.
And it looked like he was getting ready to take thm all on himself.
(gunshot)
I've known for a while katashi was in the country.
I spent yesterday tracking him down.
Didn't look like he wanted to be found.
Not particularly, no.
You think he knows what they are?
Or what they want?
Maybe.
What if he doesn't want to talk?
Isaac:
What if he doesn't even remember you?
He'll remember this.
(gunshot)
I know I didn't kill it.
I'm not sure you can.
But I slowed it down long enough for us to get out of there.
What was behind the mask?
Chris:
Darkness...
Absolute darkness.
(music playing)
(door creaking)
(exhales deeply)
You okay?
So all of your friends are...
Yeah.
And you're a...
Yeah.
(sighs)
Can I see?
Are you sure?
(music playing)
(music playing)
(engines rev)
You guys going to be doing this all day?
All day.
All night.
Is this about being in my pack?
This is about you being the target of demonic ninjas.
You mean the demonic ninjas that pulled swords out of their chests
And completely kicked our asses?
Yeah.
Those demonic ninjas.
I don't need anyone to protect me.
They were looking right at you when the sun came up.
And they also disappeared.
Argent thinks that they could just come out at night.
Since this is our first experience with demonic ninjas,
We're thinking we should play it safe.
All day.
And all night.
Okay, one thing first.
And let him know everything that happened last night.
Without you.
No.
Yes.
And I don't want you listening in.
No wolf hearing.
How would you even know?
I'm a true alpha.
You have no idea what I can do.
So then she starts talking about phosphors and the key having chemicals on it, right?
And so that made me think of the chemistry closet
And the fact that someone had to let barrow in...
It's gone.
Okay, it doesn't matter though.
It doesn't matter.
I've still got the key.
(whispers) what the hell?
I had it...
I had it here.
I had it here this morning, I swear to god, I had it this morning.
The key you were talking about last night?
Yeah, I showed it to you, right?
Didn't I show it to you?
No, you just told me about it.
I never actually saw it.
(breathing heavily)
I was here a couple of hours ago.
And the message left to barrow spelling kira's name was right there on the board
In my handwriting
And I had the key to the chemistry closet.
So you unlocked the chemistry closet
So barrow could hide in it from the cops
And then you wrote him a message to kill kira?
I know how it sounds...
But look at this.
This is the news report that came out about barrow when they caught him, okay?
About the shrapnel bomb that he used.
See this?
See what he did?
He put nuts, bolts and screws.
And then he hid the bomb and the detonator
In a box that he wrapped as a birthday present.
What does that sound like to you?
Coach.
The joke we played on coach.
You remember?
That was my idea.
That's no coincidence.
It can't be.
I don't want to sound like I'm trying to tell you that you're wrong.
But I don't think you're trying to kill people either.
It was here.
It was all here.
Dude, are you feeling okay?
You're looking really tired.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just haven't been sleeping really...
Why don't you go home?
Take a sick day or something.
Did you tell him?
No.
He's got enough on his mind right now.
If they're coming for you in a few hours then so do you.
What if it's not me?
Okay?
What if I'm not the one they want?
Who else is there?
The real problem is katashi doesn't see visitors.
Ever.
He's a paranoid recluse who rarely steps outside the gates of his estate.
Oh, he's got a thing for rare, antique weapons.
Yesterday, I had some contacts put out the word
That I was selling one from my own collection.
This is a french flintlock turnover pistol from 1645.
You're not going alone.
To be honest, I don't feel good about bringing either one of you.
They were looking right at scott when the sun came up.
Well, that doesn't necessarily mean he's the one they're going after.
But if he is?
If he is,
That might only leave us till nightfall to come up with a way to protect him.
All right.
Let's go see if a paranoid yakuza wants to put another gun in his collection.
Yeah, I'm walking in now.
And trying to avoid the hostile stares of everyone in here.
No, no.
(beeps)
Probably another week or two and we'll be ready for a formal review.
There's enough here to put stilinski so far out of government work,
He won't be able to get a job riding the back of a garbage truck.
Yeah, exactly.
Let me call you right back.
Melissa:
Dr. Gardner's not back until next week.
Do you want to try waiting for one of the urgent care doctors or...
Stiles.
Are you all right?
(shakily) I don't know.
I guess...
I guess not really.
All right, kiddo.
All right.
Come with me.
It's okay.
Blackouts.
But not for that long.
And sleepwalking, which I used to do a lot as a kid.
Um...
Also having some really bad anxiety.
Panic attacks?
Yeah, a couple.
Oh, and I temporarily lost the ability to read.
But that might have had more to do with this giant magic tree
And a whole human sacrifice thing.
I recall something vaguely about that, yes.
How many hours of sleep are you getting?
Eight.
A night?
In the last three days.
Yeah, definitely eight.
Been feeling irritable?
Yeah.
Possibly to the point of homicide.
Inability to focus?
No, the adderall's not working.
Impulsive behavior?
More than my usual?
Hard to tell.
Vivid dreams during the day?
Okay, basically all of the above.
Do you know what this is?
I think so.
Uh, what's that?
Do you trust me?
When you're not holding a needle.
(chuckles)
It's midazolam.
A sedative.
Why'd you give me a sedative?
Because you, stiles, are one profoundly sleep-deprived young man.
You need rest and you need it now.
Lie down.
Okay, how long's it take to...
Oh.
Not long at all.
(breathing heavily)
(softly) get some rest.
(whispers) thanks, mom.
(cell phone vibrating)
What is it?
Katashi won't do the buy in person.
But he's a paranoid recluse.
Shouldn't you be a little less surprised?
I was trying to remain optimistic that we wouldn't have to go to my plan b.
Plan b?
And what's plan b?
How tall are you?
(car beeps)
Guys, I appreciate you wanting to protect me.
But I have to be alone for a bit.
So...
Sorry about this.
(engine revs) (engines stall)
What do I do with these?
Chris:
Katashi's office is here.
Isaac:
Guys.
(stammering) this isn't going to work.
I look ridiculous.
I mean...
I look like I just stepped out of the last period of a catholic prep school.
And there is no way that I'm going be able to remember all this.
I mean, what does this even mean?
"revolving over and under barrels?"
(sighs)
All you have to do is keep them talking long enough to allow us to get inside
And find katashi.
He may not be there for the buy in person but...
He won't be far.
You look great.
I am sweating, all the way through my jacket.
I didn't even know that I could sweat this much.
Give me a second.
You can do this.
(exhales deeply)
You're not a boy if you walk in there acting like a man.
Okay?
Go in there with confidence
And all they'll see is a boyish looking man.
Or a stupid teenager pretending to be a man.
By a bunch of japanese fingerless mobsters...
(music playing)
How do you feel now?
Gentlemen.
I believe mr.
Katashi is expecting me.
Kincaid:
I'm expecting you.
(scraping)
(metal reverberating)
Could you lock the door?
Yeah.
(exhales deeply) we're running out of time.
I know.
But allison, her dad and isaac are working on something that could help.
I don't want to sound pessimistic or anything,
But you really think that's going to keep them out?
Actually, we have a kind of security system.
Things happened a couple of weeks ago, a lot of things,
And we had my boss help make a few changes to the house.
Your boss?
Do you work for a security company or something?
No, he's a veterinarian.
You had a vet put in your alarm?
Yeah, sort of.
But I can't arm it.
Only my mom can.
Where's she?
Don't worry.
She'll be here.
Oh!
Sorry.
We're going to be okay.
I promise.
We?
Or me?
All of us.
You didn't bring the twins here
Because you didn't want them to get hurt.
I don't want anyone getting hurt.
If those things are coming after you,
And anyone who gets in the way gets killed,
Then shouldn't I be somewhere else?
I'm not letting you get hurt.
And I don't want you getting hurt.
Especially because of me.
It could be either of us.
I don't think so.
I have to show you something.
Have you ever heard of something called a kitsune?
(woman on pa speaking indistinctly)
"patient is irritable, impulsive,
"complaints of vivid dreams.
Inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality,
"acute insomnia."
(groans)
What we're looking at here is a mint-condition french flintlock turnover pistol
Crafted in the mid-17th century.
It was a gift from louis xiv to a prominent french family.
It's only ever been fired once.
During a duel between brothers
On the grounds of the palace of versailles.
(stuttering) so you're familiar with it.
Oh, mr.
Katashi knows what he wants.
We'll take it.
$150,000.
I'm gonna need to count it.
Oh, really?
(whispers) yeah.
That looks like what happened to you at the power station.
When a kitsune rubs its tails together it can create fire or lighting.
It's called foxfire.
I don't have any tails.
(scoffs) how'd you know what I was thinking?
Because kitsune are also psychic.
I can hear all of your thoughts.
Just kidding.
The sun's setting.
Ah.
Yeah, I know.
Are you scared?
Not right now.
I'm supposed to be back before dinner.
Tell them you can't make it.
What should I say?
(softly) say, uh, you're going on a date.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
You know, foxes and wolves don't really get along.
That's just a drawing.
In a children's book.
(vehicle approaching)
My mom's back.
What are you doing here?
And why do you still have a key?
Funny you mention keys.
Because while I have a key to this house,
I'm not exactly sure how you got a key to my office.
You don't know the whole story behind this gun, do you?
There was no duel between brothers.
That was the cover story.
The real one involves an encounter in the woods with a vicious animal.
Its bite caused one of the men to change into something... (clicks tongue) monstrous.
By his family's code,
The brother of this man killed him with this very gun.
Well, that is certainly better than the version that I heard.
I'm gonna trust you guys with the money here and, uh...
Personally, I'd like to hear your story.
(growls)
(growling)
All I want to do is talk.
Taking out my security is not what I would call a good conversation starter.
You don't remember me, do you?
Allison, take the man's gun.
Now, can we talk?
Isaac:
Guys?
They have a werewolf too.
Let me help you out here.
This kind of thing usually begins with something along the lines of,
"it's not what you think." or, "I can explain."
Dad, let me help you out.
You need to leave.
I will.
With a satisfactory explanation.
Go get a warrant.
I don't need a warrant.
I'm your father.
No, you're a gene donor.
I got my hair color from you.
And that's all I got.
So you're not allowed to play tough dad with me.
Hey, what's going on?
Maybe one of you should explain.
Scott...
Who the hell is this?
Scott:
Dad, no!
Dad, wait... (groans) (screams)
Scott:
Dad.
(growls)
(growling)
(snarling)
(growling)
Mom, the ash!
(snarling)
(both growling)
Mom, now!
Do it now!
Starting to remember?
It was 24 years ago.
(gasps)
Chris:
You know what they are, don't you?
They're called oni.
They are demons.
And they are unstoppable.
All of the baseboards are ash wood?
Uh, yeah.
It was deaton's idea.
And where the hell did you come from?
I've been following you.
For how long?
All day.
Scott, this isn't good!
(gasping) need to call for backup.
How bad is it?
From the way that his arm is rotated, the tendon looks torn.
He could be on his way to a collapsed lung.
Mom, those things, they're not going to leave until the sun's up.
At the rate he's bleeding, he's not gonna make it that long.
We got to get him to the hospital.
Should we call stiles's dad?
I don't know.
Is that going to just get more people hurt?
Maybe.
I don't think guns work on them.
Then what does?
Nothing.
At least no man-made weapon.
The oni are a force of nature.
You don't fight a tsunami.
You endure it.
And you hope that you're not destroyed in its path.
Then how do we endure it?
One of you already has.
This is japanese kanji for "self".
This means he is still himself.
The oni are looking for one who is no longer themselves.
What do you mean no longer themselves?
Possessed.
By a dark spirit.
You going to tell us what you are?
What?
What do you mean?
Aiden...
Watch!
(grunts)
See that?
She can't go through it either.
So, what are you?
She's a kitsune, idiot.
Use your eyes.
You can see it all around her.
The younger ones give off an aura.
She just hasn't learned how to conceal it yet.
She probably doesn't know what kind she is either.
There are 13 kinds of kitsune.
Celestial, wild, ocean, thunder.
But there is one,
A dark kitsune.
They call it void.
Or nogitsune.
A kumicho.
That's right.
He was possessed by a nogitsune.
It's what helped him rise through the ranks of our yakuza family.
Nogitsune draws its power from pain and tragedy,
Strife and chaos.
It's not you.
It can't be.
What I saw around you, it didn't look evil.
But isn't that what a shape-shifter does?
Isn't that why a kitsune is called the trickster spirit?
It's supposed to trick you.
How are you so sure?
How do you know I'm not the bad guy?
Scott:
I've seen the bad guys.
And you're not one of them.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
Not yet.
Why do you think we're here, derek?
For a study group?
We're here to protect scott.
We're trying to fight for him.
I'm sure you are.
I'm sure you'd kill for him.
But are you willing to die for him?
Do you know why I'm missing this finger?
Penance.
There's a ritual called yubitsume.
Removing the joints of the little finger weakens your grip on a sword.
When a katana is gripped properly,
The little finger is the strongest.
Why did they take your finger?
They didn't take it.
A yakuza performs the ritual himself and offers it to his superior.
It was penance for a mistake.
And it wasn't my only one...
I don't know what it was about the way I moved or stood
That suggested to them that I was going to take them on.
Because actually I was...

Allison, please tell me that you have something.
They're here.
They're trying to get in.
They're japanese demons.
They're called the oni.
They're looking for someone possessed.
Someone with a dark spirt attached to them.
A nogitsune.
How'd you know that?

Then they won't hurt you, I promise.

Yeah, fine.

Lydia:

It doesn't look like a demon to me.
It looks like a fox.

It was all here.
Dude, are you feeling okay?
You're looking really tired.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just haven't been sleeping really...
Why don't you go home?
Take a sick day or something.
Did you tell him?
No.
He's got enough on his mind right now.
If they're coming for you in a few hours then so do you.
What if it's not me?
Okay?
What if I'm not the one they want?
Who else is there?
The real problem is Katashi doesn't see visitors.
Ever.
He's a paranoid recluse who rarely steps outside the gates of his estate.
Oh, he's got a thing for rare, antique weapons.
Yesterday, I had some contacts put out the word that I was selling one from my own collection.
This is a french flintlock turnover pistol from 1645.
You're not going alone.
Where she's going, I'm going.
To be honest, I don't feel good about bringing either one of you.
They were looking right at Scott when the sun came up.
Well, that doesn't necessarily mean he's the one they're going after.
But if he is?
If he is, that might only leave us till nightfall to come up with a way to protect him.
All right.
Let's go see if a paranoid Yakuza wants to put another gun in his collection.
Yeah, I'm walking in now.
And trying to avoid the hostile stares of everyone in here.
No, no.
(beeps)
Probably another week or two and we'll be ready for a formal review.
There's enough here to put Stilinski so far out of government work, he won't be able to get a job riding the back of a garbage truck.
Yeah, exactly.
Let me call you right back.
Melissa:
Dr. Gardner's not back until next week.
Do you want to try waiting for one of the urgent care doctors or...
Stiles.
Are you all right?
(shakily) I don't know.
I guess...
I guess not really.
All right, kiddo.
All right.
Come with me.
It's okay.
Blackouts.
But not for that long.
And sleepwalking, which I used to do a lot as a kid.
Um...
Also having some really bad anxiety.
- Panic attacks?
- Yeah, a couple.
Oh, and I temporarily lost the ability to read.
But that might have had more to do with this giant magic tree and a whole human sacrifice thing.
I recall something vaguely about that, yes.
How many hours of sleep are you getting?
Eight.
A night?
In the last three days.
Yeah, definitely eight.
Been feeling irritable?
Yeah.
Possibly to the point of homicide.
Inability to focus?
No, the Adderall's not working.
Impulsive behavior?
More than my usual?
Hard to tell.
Vivid dreams during the day?
Okay, basically all of the above.
Do you know what this is?
I think so.
Uh, what's that?
Do you trust me?
When you're not holding a needle.
(chuckles)
It's midazolam.
A sedative.
Why'd you give me a sedative?
Because you, Stiles, are one profoundly sleep-deprived young man.
You need rest and you need it now.
Lie down.
Okay, how long's it take to...
Oh.
Not long at all.
(breathing heavily)
(softly) Get some rest.
(whispers) Thanks, mom.
(cell phone vibrating)
What is it?
Katashi won't do the buy in person.
But he's a paranoid recluse.
Shouldn't you be a little less surprised?
I was trying to remain optimistic that we wouldn't have to go to my plan B.
Plan B?
And what's plan B?
How tall are you?
(car beeps)
Guys, I appreciate you wanting to protect me.
But I have to be alone for a bit.
So...
Sorry about this.
(engine revs) (engines stall)
What do I do with these?
Chris:
Katashi's office is here.
Isaac:
Guys.
(stammering) This isn't going to work.
I look ridiculous.
I mean...
I look like I just stepped out of the last period of a catholic prep school.
And there is no way that I'm going be able to remember all this.
I mean, what does this even mean?
"Revolving over and under barrels?"
(sighs)
All you have to do is keep them talking long enough to allow us to get inside and find Katashi.
He may not be there for the buy in person but...
He won't be far.
You look great.
I am sweating, all the way through my jacket.
I didn't even know that I could sweat this much.
Give me a second.
You can do this.
(exhales deeply)
You're not a boy if you walk in there acting like a man.
Okay?
Go in there with confidence and all they'll see is a boyish looking man.
Or a stupid teenager pretending to be a man.
By a bunch of Japanese fingerless mobsters...
(music playing)
How do you feel now?
Gentlemen.
I believe Mr. Katashi is expecting me.
Kincaid:
I'm expecting you.
(scraping)
(metal reverberating)
Could you lock the door?
Yeah.
(exhales deeply) We're running out of time.
I know.
But Allison, her dad and Isaac are working on something that could help.
I don't want to sound pessimistic or anything, but you really think that's going to keep them out?
Actually, we have a kind of security system.
Things happened a couple of weeks ago, a lot of things, and we had my boss help make a few changes to the house.
Your boss?
Do you work for a security company or something?
No, he's a veterinarian.
You had a vet put in your alarm?
Yeah, sort of.
But I can't arm it.
Only my mom can.
Where's she?
Don't worry.
She'll be here.
Oh!
Sorry.
We're going to be okay.
I promise.
We?
Or me?
All of us.
You didn't bring the twins here because you didn't want them to get hurt.
I don't want anyone getting hurt.
If those things are coming after you, and anyone who gets in the way gets killed, then shouldn't I be somewhere else?
I'm not letting you get hurt.
And I don't want you getting hurt.
Especially because of me.
It could be either of us.
I don't think so.
I have to show you something.
Have you ever heard of something called a Kitsune?
(woman on pa speaking indistinctly)
"Patient is irritable, impulsive,"
"complaints of vivid dreams.
Inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality,"
"acute insomnia."
(groans)
What we're looking at here is a mint-condition french flintlock turnover pistol crafted in the mid-17th century.
It was a gift from Louis XIV to a prominent french family.
It's only ever been fired once.
During a duel between brothers on the grounds of the palace of Versailles.
(stuttering) So you're familiar with it.
Oh, Mr. Katashi knows what he wants.
We'll take it.
$150,000.
I'm gonna need to count it.
Oh, really?
(whispers) Yeah.
That looks like what happened to you at the power station.
When a Kitsune rubs its tails together it can create fire or lighting.
It's called foxfire.
I don't have any tails.
(scoffs) How'd you know what I was thinking?
Because Kitsune are also psychic.
I can hear all of your thoughts.
Just kidding.
The sun's setting.
Ah.
Yeah, I know.
Are you scared?
Not right now.
I'm supposed to be back before dinner.
Tell them you can't make it.
What should I say?
(softly) Say, uh, you're going on a date.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
You know, foxes and wolves don't really get along.
That's just a drawing.
In a children's book.
(vehicle approaching)
My mom's back.
What are you doing here?
And why do you still have a key?
Funny you mention keys.
Because while I have a key to this house,
I'm not exactly sure how you got a key to my office.
You don't know the whole story behind this gun, do you?
There was no duel between brothers.
That was the cover story.
The real one involves an encounter in the woods with a vicious animal.
Its bite caused one of the men to change into something... (clicks tongue) Monstrous.
By his family's code, the brother of this man killed him with this very gun.
Well, that is certainly better than the version that I heard.
I'm gonna trust you guys with the money here and, uh...
Personally, I'd like to hear your story.
(growls)
(growling)
All I want to do is talk.
Taking out my security is not what I would call a good conversation starter.
You don't remember me, do you?
Allison, take the man's gun.
Now, can we talk?
Isaac:
Guys?
They have a werewolf too.
Let me help you out here.
This kind of thing usually begins with something along the lines of,
"it's not what you think." or, "I can explain."
Dad, let me help you out.
You need to leave.
I will.
With a satisfactory explanation.
Go get a warrant.
I don't need a warrant.
I'm your father.
No, you're a gene donor.
I got my hair color from you.
And that's all I got.
So you're not allowed to play tough dad with me.
Hey, what's going on?
Maybe one of you should explain.
Scott...
Who the hell is this?
Scott:
Dad, no!
Dad, wait... (groans) (screams)
Scott:
Dad.
(growls)
(growling)
(snarling)
(growling)
Mom, the ash!
(snarling)
(both growling)
Mom, now!
Do it now!
Starting to remember?
It was 24 years ago.
(gasps)
Chris:
You know what they are, don't you?
They're called Oni.
They are demons.
And they are unstoppable.
All of the baseboards are ash wood?
Uh, yeah.
It was Deaton's idea.
And where the hell did you come from?
I've been following you.
For how long?
All day.
Scott, this isn't good!
(gasping) Need to call for backup.
How bad is it?
From the way that his arm is rotated, the tendon looks torn.
He could be on his way to a collapsed lung.
Mom, those things, they're not going to leave until the sun's up.
At the rate he's bleeding, he's not gonna make it that long.
We got to get him to the hospital.
Should we call Stiles's dad?
I don't know.
Is that going to just get more people hurt?
Maybe.
I don't think guns work on them.
Then what does?
Nothing.
At least no man-made weapon.
The Oni are a force of nature.
You don't fight a tsunami.
You endure it.
And you hope that you're not destroyed in its path.
Then how do we endure it?
One of you already has.
This is Japanese kanji for "self".
This means he is still himself.
The Oni are looking for one who is no longer themselves.
What do you mean no longer themselves?
Possessed.
By a dark spirit.
You going to tell us what you are?
What?
What do you mean?
Aiden...
Watch!
(grunts)
See that?
She can't go through it either.
So, what are you?
She's a Kitsune, idiot.
Use your eyes.
You can see it all around her.
The younger ones give off an aura.
She just hasn't learned how to conceal it yet.
She probably doesn't know what kind she is either.
There are 13 kinds of Kitsune.
Celestial, wild, ocean, thunder.
But there is one, a dark Kitsune.
They call it void.
Or Nogitsune.
A kumicho.
That's right.
He was possessed by a Nogitsune.
It's what helped him rise through the ranks of our Yakuza family.
Nogitsune draws its power from pain and tragedy, strife and chaos.
It's not you.
It can't be.
What I saw around you, it didn't look evil.
But isn't that what a shape-shifter does?
Isn't that why a Kitsune is called the trickster spirit?
It's supposed to trick you.
How are you so sure?
How do you know I'm not the bad guy?
Scott:
I've seen the bad guys.
And you're not one of them.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
Not yet.
Why do you think we're here, Derek?
For a study group?
We're here to protect Scott.
We're trying to fight for him.
I'm sure you are.
I'm sure you'd kill for him.
But are you willing to die for him?
Do you know why I'm missing this finger?
Penance.
There's a ritual called Yubitsume.
Removing the joints of the little finger weakens your grip on a sword.
When a katana is gripped properly, the little finger is the strongest.
Why did they take your finger?
They didn't take it.
A Yakuza performs the ritual himself and offers it to his superior.
It was penance for a mistake.
And it wasn't my only one...
I don't know what it was about the way I moved or stood that suggested to them that I was going to take them on.
Because actually I was...
Preparing to run for my life.
(gunshot) That shot you fired saved me from looking like a coward before the survivors.
For that humiliation, I wouldn't have to have given up my finger.
I would've had to give up my head.
I wish I could give you the answer you need, Mr. Argent.
I owe you more than my life.
I owe you my honor.
I will tell you one thing, however.
If there is a nogitsune among you...
Let the Oni destroy it.
Even if it is your own daughter.
(rumbling)
Scott:
What are they doing?
Testing for weaknesses.
Guys?
We have a problem.
(breathing heavily)
(weakly) I need to speak to Scott.
You're kidding, right?
Don't patronize me...
Melissa.
You know why...
You know why I really came back, don't you?
And as usual your timing sucks.
You're not talking to him.
Not like this.
So, you stay awake and we're gonna get you out of here as fast as we can.
Allison, please tell me that you have something.
They're here.
They're trying to get in.
And it looks like they're going to be able to.
Ok.
Ok, listen.
They're Japanese demons.
They're called the Oni.
They're looking for someone possessed.
Someone with a dark spirit attached to them.
A nogitsune.
How'd you know that?
Scott?
Just...
Tell me what else.
Ok.
They won't hurt you.
They know you're supernatural.
Once they do this check, once they realize that you're not carrying with you this dark spirit, then they won't hurt you, I promise.
All they're looking for is the nogitsune.
I'm right, aren't I?
They're looking for a dark spirit.
And I know it's not you.
Scott, we're going to have to do something.
Don't do anything.
Is he serious?
(snarling)
I said don't do anything.
Trust me.
(gasps)
Ethan:
You're gonna be okay.
Melissa?
Hey, stab wound to the left chest.
Possible collapsed lung.
Pulse is weak.
I'll find Stiles.
(indistinct conversations)
(snarling)
(breathing rapidly)
(thud)
Stiles?
You okay?
Yeah, fine.
What's been going on?
(exhales deeply)
(music playing)
Previously on Teen Wolf.
Whoa.
I look like a demon from hell.
It doesn't look like a demon to me.
It looks like a fox.
Barrow was hiding in the chemistry closet.
Someone left him a message on the blackboard telling him to kill Kira.
They came out of the shadows.
One of them, I could see his eyes, like a firefly.
Dad, do you know what that means?
I think they might have been after me.
His eyes were glowing.
There was something almost ritualistic about it.
Like it was looking right into his soul.
That's the same thing it did to me.
That's what it did to everyone.
Not everyone.
They only came after the werewolves.
And Lydia.
Anyone with a connection to the supernatural.
Then who was the guy they went after in Japan?
A kumicho.
A yakuza boss.
It was my first gun deal.
I was only 18 and it was supposed to be a simple exchange.
Except Gerard left out the minor detail of the buyers being yakuza.
He wanted to see if I could adapt in the moment.
Testing my ability to improvise.
Or your ability to survive.
The moment the sun went down it was like they just materialized out of the shadows.
They had swords, not curved like katanas but straight, black steel.
Like ninjatos.
What did they want?
To get to the kumicho.
They cut down every living thing in their way.
Did they mark him like they did us?
Not exactly.
What was he?
I don't know.
But there might be someone who does.
There were a few others who survived that night.
One of them was a man named Katashi...
They called him Silverfinger because of an unusual prosthetic.
And it looked like he was getting ready to take them all on himself.
I've known for a while Katashi was in the country.
I spent yesterday tracking him down.
Didn't look like he wanted to be found.
Not particularly, no.
You think he knows what they are?
Or what they want?
Maybe.
What if he doesn't want to talk?
What if he doesn't even remember you?
He'll remember this.
I know I didn't kill it.
I'm not sure you can.
But I slowed it down long enough for us to get out of there.
What was behind the mask?
Darkness...
Absolute darkness.
You okay?
So all of your friends are...
Yeah.
And you're a...
Yeah.
Can I see?
Are you sure?
You guys going to be doing this all day?
- All day.
- All night.
Is this about being in my pack?
This is about you being the target of demonic ninjas.
You mean the demonic ninjas that pulled swords out of their chests and completely kicked our asses?
Yeah.
Those demonic ninjas.
I don't need anyone to protect me.
They were looking right at you when the sun came up.
And they also disappeared.
Argent thinks that they could just come out at night.
Since this is our first experience with demonic ninjas, we're thinking we should play it safe.
All day.
And all night.
Okay, one thing first.
I need to talk to Stiles and let him know everything that happened last night.
Without you.
- No.
- Yes.
And I don't want you listening in.
No wolf hearing.
How would you even know?
I'm a true Alpha.
You have no idea what I can do.
So then she starts talking about phosphors and the key having chemicals on it, right?
And so that made me think of the chemistry closet and the fact that someone had to let Barrow in...
It's gone.
Okay, it doesn't matter though.
It doesn't matter.
I've still got the key.
What the hell?
I had it...
I had it here.
I had it here this morning, I swear to God, I had it this morning.
The key you were talking about last night?
Yeah, I showed it to you, right?
Didn't I show it to you?
No, you just told me about it.
I never actually saw it.
I was here a couple of hours ago.
And the message left to Barrow spelling Kira's name was right there on the board in my handwriting and I had the key to the chemistry closet.
So you unlocked the chemistry closet so Barrow could hide in it from the cops and then you wrote him a message to kill Kira?
I know how it sounds...
But look at this.
This is the news report that came out about Barrow when they caught him, okay?
About the shrapnel bomb that he used.
See this?
See what he did?
He put nuts, bolts and screws.
And then he hid the bomb and the detonator in a box that he wrapped as a birthday present.
What does that sound like to you?
Coach.
The joke we played on Coach.
That was my idea.
You remember?
That was my idea.
That's no coincidence.
It can't be.
I don't want to sound like I'm trying to tell you that you're wrong.
But I don't think you're trying to kill people either.
It was here.
It was all here.
Dude, are you feeling okay?
You're looking really tired.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just haven't been sleeping really...
Why don't you go home?
Take a sick day or something.
Did you tell him?
No.
He's got enough on his mind right now.
If they're coming for you in a few hours then so do you.
What if it's not me?
Okay?
What if I'm not the one they want?
Who else is there?
The real problem is Katashi doesn't see visitors.
Ever.
He's a paranoid recluse who rarely steps outside the gates of his estate.
So how are you going to get to him?
Oh, he's got a thing for rare, antique weapons.
Yesterday, I had some contacts put out the word that I was selling one from my own collection.
This is a French Flintlock Turnover Pistol from 1645.
You're not going alone.
If she's going I'm going.
To be honest, I don't feel good about bringing either one of you.
They were looking right at Scott when the sun came up.
Well, that doesn't necessarily mean he's the one they're going after.
But if he is?
If he is, that might only leave us till nightfall to come up with a way to protect him.
All right.
Let's go see if a paranoid yakuza wants to put another gun in his collection.
Yeah, I'm walking in now.
And trying to avoid the hostile stares of everyone in here.
No, no.
Probably another week or two and we'll be ready for a formal review.
There's enough here to put Stilinski so far out of government work, he won't be able to get a job riding the back of a garbage truck.
Yeah, exactly.
Let me call you right back.
Dr. Gardner's not back until next week.
Do you want to try waiting for one of the urgent care doctors or...
Stiles.
Are you all right?
I don't know.

I guess not really.

All right.
Come with me.
It's okay.

Uh, what's that?

Because you, Stiles, are one profoundly sleep-deprived young man.
You need rest and you need it now.
Lie down.
Okay, how long's it take to...
Oh.
Not long at all.
Get some rest.
Thanks, Mom.
What is it?
Katashi won't do the buy in person.
But he's a paranoid recluse.
Shouldn't you be a little less surprised?
I was trying to remain optimistic that we wouldn't have to go to my Plan B.
Plan B?
And what's Plan B?
How tall are you?
Guys, I appreciate you wanting to protect me.
But I have to be alone for a bit.
So...
Sorry about this.
What do I do with these?
Katashi's office is here.
Guys.
This isn't going to work.
I look ridiculous.
I mean...
I look like I just stepped out of the last period of a Catholic prep school.
And there is no way that I'm going be able to remember all this.

Okay?
Go in there with confidence and all they'll see is a boyish looking man.

I'm going to get my head blown off by a bunch of Japanese fingerless mobsters...
How do you feel now?

I'm expecting you.

We're running out of time.

All of us.

"It's not what you think." Or, "I can explain."
Dad, let me help you out.
You need to leave.
I will.
With a satisfactory explanation.
- Go get a warrant.
- I don't need a warrant.
I'm your father.
No, you're a gene donor.
I got my hair color from you.
And that's all I got.
So you're not allowed to play tough dad with me.
Hey, what's going on?
Maybe one of you should explain.
Scott...
Who the hell is this?
Dad, no!
Dad, wait...
Dad.
Mom, the ash!
Mom, now!
Do it now!
Starting to remember?
It was 24 years ago.
You know what they are, don't you?
They're called oni.
They are demons.
And they are unstoppable.
All of the baseboards are ash wood?
Uh, yeah.
It was Deaton's idea.
And where the hell did you come from?
I've been following you.
For how long?
All day.
Scott, this isn't good!
Need to call for backup.
How bad is it?
From the way that his arm is rotated, the tendon looks torn.
He could be on his way to a collapsed lung.
Mom, those things, they're not going to leave until the sun's up.
At the rate he's bleeding, he's not gonna make it that long.
We got to get him to the hospital.
Should we call Stiles's Dad?
I don't know.
Is that going to just get more people hurt?
Maybe.
I don't think guns work on them.
Then what does?
Nothing.
At least no man-made weapon.
The oni are a force of nature.
You don't fight a tsunami.
You endure it.
And you hope that you're not destroyed in its path.
Then how do we endure it?
One of you already has.
This is Japanese kanji for "self".
This means he is still himself.
The oni are looking for one who is no longer themselves.
What do you mean no longer themselves?
Possessed.
By a dark spirit.
It's Kira, right?
You going to tell us what you are?
What?
What do you mean?
Aiden...
Watch!
See that?
She can't go through it either.
So, what are you?
She's a kitsune, idiot.
Use your eyes.
You can see it all around her.
The younger ones give off an aura.
She just hasn't learned how to conceal it yet.
She probably doesn't know what kind she is either.
There are 13 kinds of kitsune.
Celestial, wild, ocean, thunder.
But there is one, a dark kitsune.
They call it void.
Or nogitsune.
A kumicho.
That's right.
He was possessed by a nogitsune.
It's what helped him rise through the ranks of our yakuza family.
Nogitsune draws its power from pain and tragedy, strife and chaos.
It's not you.
It can't be.
What I saw around you, it didn't look evil.
But isn't that what a shape-shifter does?
Isn't that why a kitsune is called the trickster spirit?
It's supposed to trick you.
How are you so sure?
How do you know I'm not the bad guy?
I've seen the bad guys.
And you're not one of them.
I wasn't going to hurt her.
Not yet.
Why do you think we're here, Derek?
For a study group?
We're here to protect Scott.
We're trying to fight for him.
I'm sure you are.
I'm sure you'd kill for him.
But are you willing to die for him?
Do you know why I'm missing this finger?
Penance.
There's a ritual called yubitsume.
Removing the joints of the little finger weakens your grip on a sword.
When a katana is gripped properly, the little finger is the strongest.
Why did they take your finger?
They didn't take it.
A yakuza performs the ritual himself and offers it to his superior.
It was penance for a mistake.
And it wasn't my only one...
I don't know what it was about the way I moved or stood that suggested to them that I was going to take them on.
Because actually I was...
Preparing to run for my life.
That shot you fired saved me from looking like a coward before the survivors.
For that humiliation, I wouldn't have to have given up my finger.
I would've had to give up my head.
I wish I could give you the answer you need, Mr. Argent.
I owe you more than my life.
I owe you my honor.
I will tell you one thing, however.
If there is a nogitsune among you...
Let the oni destroy it.
Even if it is your own daughter.
What are they doing?
Testing for weaknesses.
Guys?
We have a problem.
I need to speak to Scott.
You're kidding, right?
Don't patronize me...
Melissa.
You know why...
You know why I really came back, don't you?
And as usual your timing sucks.
You're not talking to him.
Not like this.
So, you stay awake and we're gonna get you out of here as fast as we can.
Allison, please tell me that you have something.
They're here.
They're trying to get in.
And it looks like they're gonna' be able to do it.
Okay, okay listen.
They're Japanese demons.
They're called the oni.
They're looking for someone possessed.
Someone with a dark spirit attached to them.
A nogitsune.
How'd you know that?
Scott?
Just...
Tell me what else.
Okay, they won't hurt you.
They know you're supernatural but once they do this check, once they realize that you're not carrying with you this dark spirit, then they won't hurt you, I promise.
All they're looking for is the nogitsune.
I'm right, aren't I?
They're looking for me.
They're looking for a dark spirit.
And I know it's not you.
Scott, we're going to have to do something.
Don't do anything.
Is he serious?
I said don't do anything.
Trust me.
You're gonna be okay.
Melissa?
Hey, stab wound to the left chest.
Possible collapsed lung.
Pulse is weak.
I'll find Stiles.
Stiles?
You okay?
Yeah, fine.
What's been going on?

Clarence:
Time for our next plan.
[action music]
[Up-Tempo music plays] Here's what we do.
[Bell tolls] First, we find a clock tower.
Then we scale it to get close to the telephone wires.
Then we'll fly up to the wires and use the handcuffs ... by the way, we'll need handcuffs, probably at the police ... to zip-line over the town.
Then, when we see your house, we'll just fall into the bushes.
Your house has bushes, right?
Ow.
- Unless you got a better idea?
- I do have a better idea.
[gasps] Is it a boat?
I hope it's a boat.
[Boat horn blows]
No, this isn't a boat.
I don't want to do this.
Look at all that.
I can't even understand it ...
all the lines and colors.
The green line is our bus.
We get on here, ride for 4.3 miles, and get off here.
- That's it.
- Is that really it?
But when does it get here?
How long does it take?
What if we have to wait forever?
[angelic music plays]
Whoa!
That's so easy!
Do people know about this?
From now on, I'm gonna be more decisive.
And tomorrow,
I'm finally gonna talk to that red-haired girl.
I'm gonna walk right up to her and tell her she's beautiful.
Clarence?
Clarence?

Oh, sorry.
Sometimes, I fall asleep with my eyes open.
Are we in Florida yet?

You can tell Mr. Googly all your secrets.
I have a new best friend now.
Oh really?
Who would that be?
I don't want to tell you who she is.
She?
I said too much.
Okay, why don't you tell Mr. Googly all about your new best friend and none of us will listen.
I'm this many.
I'm done with you now.
Goodbye.
They grow up so fast.

I was so worried about this new school year.
New school, new people, I didn't think I was going to survive.
Not only am I surviving, I'm thriving.
I'm like a plant going like this...
What was I so worried about?
What are you doing?
Oh, but this is too easy.
It's Maya.
I know because I saw you put your hand over my face.
- I'll do you now.
- Oh, that's not the game.
- What's the game?
- The game is protect the plant from the bulldozer in the pink sweater.
Oh, Maya, bulldozers don't wear pink...
Huh.
You okay?
Yeah.
Oh, look what the bulldozer did to you.
There are other girls in this world.
- There are.
- And other girls, like Missy Bradford, are going to talk to Lucas.
- They are.
- I don't like that.
- I know.
- I wish the world was just me and you.
Then it is.
Sneak attack...
December 7th, 1941.
"A date which will live in infamy."
A date?
They're going on a date?
In Italy?
No, honey.
- You're in History.
- I'm history?
Okay, put your hand up.
Yes, Riley?
You have a pertinent observation on the subject of the sneak attack?
"May I be excused?"
My eyes see my shoes.
Yes, Riley, you may be excused.
Forever?
No, you have to come back to class at some point, honey.
You just have to.
It was another sunny day in paradise before the sneak attack that changed everything.
Do you like the movies?
Dark at the movies.
Depends on the movie.
Depends who I'm going with.
Mm, scary movies?
I get scared at scary movies.
You'll take care of me though, right?
People who had viewed themselves as safe no longer had any security at all.
Just you and me, Missy?
Just you and me, Lucas.
Boop.
Boop?
That's the best you got?
Please be cool, please be cool, please be cool.
You don't think that I can do boop?
How bad do you think this is gonna be?
I think we should have some faith in our Riley.
I can do boop like you've never seen.
Boop!
Does anybody see this?
Everybody sees this.
Take your finger out!
Can't.
Can't move.
Scared.
Do you think Lucas knows?
Riley, I've never seen anything like this before.
I don't know what's going to happen.
- Farkle?
- Boy, Riley.
I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
Hey, Maya, boop.
Oh no.
The bombing of Pearl Harbor was our official entrance into a world at war, and nothing would ever be the same.
- You want me to bring you lunch?
- No.
Food would only keep me alive.
Come on, little plant.
Come back into the sun.
I'm afraid something terrible will happen if I ever come out of here.
Riley, that's crazy.
Nothing could be worse than what's already happened.
Oh, there you are.
I've been looking for you.
You're not upset with me, are you?
Because I didn't hear that you and Lucas were together or anything.
- We're not.
- Hmm, yeah, that's what I thought.
So if you're not, then it's not a problem if I ask Lucas out, because he's really cute.
Don't you think?
I loathe you.
Well, Lucas doesn't.
In fact, I think he's kind of into me.
Shocker.
I live here now.
Come on, P.J. time.
- No, thank you.
- Oh come on, what's tonight's thing?
- No more P.J.s.
- But they have Mr. Googly on them.
I can't wear those anymore.
- Why not?
- Because she won't like them.
Hey, I'm the only "she" who gets to see you in your pajamas.
You never know.
Auggie?
Do us a favor and don't grow up so fast, okay?
I need to.
I need to grow up and go to bed like daddy does.
How does daddy go to bed?
Like this.
Ho, mama!
- I don't do that.
- Yeah, you do.
Every night.
Yeah, but I do it better than that.
If you say so.
Auggie, can I at least have my good-night kiss?
- Okay?
- We're not going to do that anymore.
It's tonight's thing.
Kissing's for babies.
Men shake hands.
Good night, Father.
Good night, Mother.
What's happening?
Don't take it personally, Cory.
He thinks he's being an adult.
How can he be an adult?
I'm not an adult!
Auggie, please, take Mr. Googly, okay?
Goodbye.

I think of this as a personal challenge issued by Missy Bradford to grow up and to grow up fast.
- So what do I do?
- Nothing.
Give me advice.
You're a genius at this.
- Grow me up.
- Why?
- Because everybody else is.
- That's not the way I see it.
How can you see it any other way?
Missy Bradford has decided to grow up fast.
That has nothing to do with you.
But what if Lucas takes her to a scary movie?
"I get scared at scary movies.
You'll take care of me, won't you?"
Barf!
Barf, I say!
Riley, do you want Lucas to take you to the movies?
Alone?
I don't know if I'm ready for that.
- Then what do you want from him?
- I don't know.
I just...
I don't want him with her.
- Am I jealous?
- You wouldn't know how to be jealous.
I just...
I don't want him taken away from us.
She's bad news.
Teach me how to flirt.
Not gonna do that.
- Why not?
- I don't even know how to flirt.
Who our age knows how to flirt?
Hello, ladies.
Farkle, you were out there?
I'm always out there.
Farkle, you're the biggest flirt in seventh grade.
Why, thank you.
Can you teach me how to flirt with Lucas?
I would do whatever you asked me.
But I thought you loved her.
I love both of you.
I want you happy.
So you think he'll sit with us or her?
I try not to worry about things I have no control over.
Really?
Because that's all I do.
- Hey, can I sit with you guys?
- You better.
So you think he'll sit with us or her?
Hey, what's up?
Is there a seat with you guys?
Always room for you, buddy.
I said "buddy." I'm not helping myself, am I?
Well, you know, I was just thinking that if you and I are going to the movies together,
I should find out what kind of snacks you like so I could buy some for you.
Because...
I wouldn't want you paying for everything.
- You're toast.
- I know.
Are you saying she flirts better than you?
Oh, nobody's better than Farkle.
I just don't think my young protege is ready for that monster.
So what are you gonna do, genius?
I think I'll just steal her from Lucas myself.
You would do that for me?
Well, I'm certainly not doing it for me, toots.
She's evil.
If I'm not back in two minutes, she ate me.
- How's my hair?
- It hasn't changed in six years.
She doesn't stand a chance.
Hello, lady.
- Farkle.
- Why go to the movies with a boy when you can go with a man?
Enjoy.
Wow, look at you.
You're next.
It worked.
I'm next.
Riley, she's too good.
You can't compete with her.
I don't want them together.
I don't.
Riley?
- Lucas.
- Riley.
I don't know what's going on here and I don't have any right to say this, but I don't think you should hang out alone with this girl.
Why not?
I don't really know,
I think if you actually spend time with her alone it's gonna change things for... you know,
- all of us.
- Well, aren't you just a concerned friend?
Yeah, I am.
Well, with you around, how could I ever possibly get Lucas alone?
Food fight!
- Hey!
- No food fight!
Detention this afternoon, both of you!
Oh no, both of us...
Alone.
- How could you do that, Dad?
- What did I do?
You gave them detention together.
I was the cafeteria monitor.
I saw potatoes not where potatoes are supposed to be.
Detention him, detention her.
But Lucas didn't even do anything.
Don't care.
I'm mad with power.
Then I want detention too.
You do?
Riley, you've never had detention in your whole life.
What could you possibly do that would get you detention on such short notice?
I could introduce you to my special guest star.
Uh-oh.
Nothing personal, bub.
Yeah, that'll do it.
- Nice job.
- Pleasure doing business with you.
♪ Oh oh oh oh. ♪
Oh my gosh, look at you.
How's my breath?
Ooh, like flowers.
How'd you do that?
I ate your flowers.
- Mommy?
- Yeah?
You're an older woman, right?
Okay, where is this going?
I have an older woman coming over.
Her name is Ava, she likes cheese and I'm in love with her.
Really?
Where is Ava from?
She's from down the hall.
Do you think you could find some cheese and make yourself scarce?
Too late, she's here.
I'll g-g-g...
I'll g-g-g...
Okay okay okay, calm down.
Women like it when you're calm.
Just take a deep breath, okay?
And then open the door.
I can't wait to meet your older woman.
- Hi, Auggie.
- Hi, Ava.
This is my mommy.
It's so nice to meet you, Ava.
You got cheese?
I like cheese.
So I've heard.
So, um, Ava?
How old are you?
I'm this many.
I see.
Older woman.
Yeah, because Auggie's this many.
Yeah, but you like him anyway, right?
- Yeah.
- How come?
Because this many tells this many what to do.
What?
I'm okay with it, Mom.
Really?
Because I have some thoughts.
Is that a Mr. Googly?
No.
I think it is.
It's not mine.
I'm too old for it.
- I want it!
- What?
Ava...
Why would you want a Mr. Googly?
You're this many.
I love Mr. Googly.
I'm taking him.
But you're all growed up.
I don't care.
He's mine now.
Actually, Ava, what you're gonna do is give Mr. Googly back to Auggie.
Why would I do that?
Because I'm this many and this many gets to tell this many what to do.
- Do you like rides?
- Yeah.
Oh great!
Let's take a ride all the way back to your house!
- Bye-bye, Auggie.
- Bye-bye, Ava.
Okay, bye-bye, Ava.
- Bye!
- Bye.
So what'd you think of her?
- How you doing?
- What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm a bad girl.
Yeah, you don't want to mess with this one.
What are these, place cards?
Yep, I made them.
You sit over there.
I think this seat has my name on it, actually.
All right, guys.
I like my detention to have a little learning in it.
So I'd like to continue talking about Pearl Harbor and what happened after the sneak attack.
The world was at war and alliances were forged in battle and were made stronger because of that.
What is this place?
It's detention, Farkle.
It's not for you.
If my friends are in it, then it's for me.
During this war the United States was put to one of its greatest tests when it met a threat to our way of life.
But because we were united
- we prevailed.
- Hey, Riley?
Missy invited me to see a movie with her.
I think she's aware of that, Lucas.
No need to make her feel worse.
And I was wondering if maybe you guys would like to come along with us?
You want us?
Uh uh, I'm sorry, Lucas.
- That wasn't the invitation.
- Oh!
Well then,
I'm sorry, Missy, but I can't go.
What are you talking about?
Nobody's ever turned me down in my life.
Well, see, these are my friends.
And I don't like doing anything without my friends.
Right, Riley?
Yeah.
Right.
Now I certainly appreciate your wanting me to care of you during a scary movie, and you showing me your leg and all, but back here in the seventh grade,
I think maybe we'd have more fun just hanging out together.
Boop.
Grow up.
Not...
Yet.
Oh, she's leaving?
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You know what the easiest thing about having friends is?
- What?
- Sometimes all you have to do is trust them.
When peace time came, the United States enjoyed its greatest period of growth, prosperity and happiness.
Detention over.
You guys coming?
No, we're good right here.
Good night, Mother.
Good night, Father.
I'm not sure how much longer I can put up with this.
Now you listen to me, kid.
You take these jammies and you wear them.
And you take Mr. Googly and you hold on to him for as long as you can.
- Why?
- Because he's your friend, you can trust him and he loves you.
Right?
Yeah, he does.
And, Auggie, it's very important that you hold onto your friends.
And, Auggie, stay this many for as long as possible, 'cause when it's gone, it's gone.
Good night, buddy.
- You want one?
- Yeah.
Then you have to catch me!
You want one?
Yeah!
- Then you have to catch me!
- Oh, mama!

Ask your doctor if you're healthy enough for sexual activity.
If you have an erection lasting longer than four hours, call me!
Hi, I'm Amy Schumer, and you can buy lab coats on eBay.
An erection that won't go away is considered a medical emergency,
But in my book, it's more of a medical opportunity.
Here in my state-of-the-art facility, you and I will handle the situation together.
How much does it cost?
Free.
No insurance?
Me neither.
Never have.
Probably never will.
Medically induced erections are nothing to be ashamed of.
You should be proud.
And more importantly, you should be on your way over here.
If I can't wrestle that gator down, no doctor will be able to.
So, please, for your health, call the emergency number on your screen right now.
It's my number.
Oh!
Hi, this is Amy.
Yes, I'm avail...
Oh, it already went down?
Just from hearing my voice?
You sure?
Well, thank you for...
Hello?
Okay, that was a wrong number.
You can call me literally anytime, 24 hours, seven days a week.
I'm available at midnight on New Year's.
For the last three years.
Ripped By mstoll
I was just staying at a W. You know that chain?
Right, the W?
Can you believe how preten...
Just to call yourself that.
Like, "We're just gonna be a letter.
It's just...
Should we shorten it?
Should we just be the Dub?
I don't know.
I don't want rich people to have to talk too long."
So I was staying in a W in Miami.
I always forget not to go back there.
I went with my sister for a vacation 'cause we're so stupid.
We got down there and we saw the other women walking by the ocean.
We were like, "Ohh.
We're not making out with shit."
The staff at the hotel saw us clock them, and they were just like, "Do you want a drink?"
I was like, "I want a burka.
Cover me."
I was like, "What are those?"
They were like, "Those are women."
I was like, "What are we?"
They were like, "We don't know."
Welcome to the U.
I would love so much to help you today.
I'm checking in.
That would be my great pleasure.
May I offer you a kumquat and elderflower julep?
Yeah.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
Really.
This is a lot nicer than the hotels I usually stay at.
I'm just in town for work for the night.
Oh, I'm so happy you felt comfortable enough to share that with me.
What name would the reservation be under?
Amy Schumer.
Of course.
Perfect.
My parents almost named me Amy, but I didn't deserve it.
You picked a great weekend to be here.
Willow Nolte is guest deejaying in the lobby tonight.
Nick Nolte's stepdaughter.
Wow.
Here's your room key.
Checkout is at 11:00.
And now I will show you to your room.
You're an angel, and it's my great honor to breathe the same air as you.
Now, this is Soak, our pool experience.
Over here we have Splay, our lounge area.
Oh, wow.
Oh, I would have had more of that.
And right here is Soar, which will take us to your room.
Oh, I love your shoes.
Everything about you is just so on point.
Thank you.
I love rolling this bag around.
'Cause it's yours.
Welcome home.
This is huge.
You could fit three people in here.
This is too fancy for me.
No, don't say that.
No.
This is all about you.
You deserve this.
You make Kate Middleton look like a mental patient shitting herself in a rusty wheelchair.
Right this way.
All of our water is pumped in from virginal koi ponds where two beautiful swans are making love for the first time.
Our ceramic sustainable infinity toilet has an orgasm every time you flush.
Ohh, yes!
I never have to fake It with you, Amy.
You look radiant.
Take a look at yourself in the mirror.
See what I see.
Wait, why is it...
Why aren't you in the mirror?
Oh, it doesn't reflect the staff.
We're nothing.
I'm shit.
Look at me running my mouth off like a stupid dumb bitch.
Anyway, you must be exhausted.
I'll leave you alone.
Okay.
- Hello, angel.
- Oh, my God.
Can I tuck you in?
- Uh, you don't have to...
- Oh, I want to.
Oh.
Now, would you like to be awakened by a soft kiss on the cheek or a stranger going down on you?
Oh, I don't k-know.
I guess the latter?
Okay, we can just feel it out in the moment, then.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
- Anything?
- Um...
Well, I hate to ask, but I usually sleep with a white-noise machine...
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
- I really prefer...
- Whale noises?
That's my specialty.
We have standards, guys.
What do we serve stuff In?
Glassware, correct?
No red cups.
Come on!
Housekeeping.
I'll be out in a minute!
Chop-chop!
So, what's going on In the bar right now?
Are they out of glassware?
Good morning.
Late checkout?
- Is it?
- It's after 11:00.
I'm going to have to charge you for another day.
It's like five after.
Should I just leave that all on the Visa?
- It's me.
- All on the Visa, ma'am?
Yeah, I guess...
This woman is no longer a guest at the hotel.
She's done.
She's done talking to you.
This way, ma'am.
She's done.
Oh, no, no.
I think she just didn't recognize me.
Wait.
Let me just...
- Hi, I'm checking in.
- Oh, I love that scarf.
Is that Egyptian silk?
Everything about you is just so on point.
Wait!
It's me!
It's me!
Please!
I go to the front desk at the Dub and, of course, the girl working there is just, like, gorgeous, just this fiery Latina.
Just amazing, just, like, tan Khaleesi.
You know, just...
Skinny.
She looked like this with perfect tits.
Just...
They were so high.
She's like resting her chin on them.
She's like, "Mmm..."
She's like, "This is why I can't read."
Like, struggling with her own titties.
She was so hot.
She was like, "Can I help you?
Mnnnh!"
Like, only Latina chicks can do that, right?
Like, they're so sexy.
It always sounds like they're waking up from, like, a grumpy nap, you know?
Just, "Mnnnh!
I'm mad.
I don't know why.
Mnnh."
So hot, right?
Everything they say, it sounds like they're coming.
It doesn't matter how mundane.
It could be like, "I have to go to the Laundromat."'
You're like, "Oh, my God, are you coming, talking about your dirty clothes right now?"
Can you imagine if I tried to do that as a white chick?
"Where's the Laundromat?"
Ew!
You white monster, shut up!
This is gonna be good.
Do we really have to do this?
Yes.
We're not communicating.
We need help.
We're not communicating?
Yeah.
We're not communicating.
I don't even know what you're saying right now.
Hello.
Hi, I'm Chrissy Teigen.
I'm so sorry about the wait.
Come on in.
Thank you so much for seeing us.
No problem.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
So, let's get started.
First of all, how long have you two been together?
Four years.
We had a good run, if that's what you mean.
Well, I think it's great you guys are both here.
It shows that this relationship is something that's important to the both of you.
I'm sorry...
Aren't you a model?
She's a supermodel.
You sound like a real asshole right now.
I actually was a model, but now I'm a clinical social worker, and I really love it.
You know, I'm really enjoying this now.
And, I mean, who wants to ride a horse naked for the camera all the time?
I'd rather just do that on my own.
And as you know, modeling is great, but you hit 27 and suddenly you're old.
Oh, that's not old.
- Amy's 37.
- I'm 32.
Yeah, but you're a drinker.
All right, so let's talk about what brought you two here.
I'll start.
Um...
You know, when... when Amy gets jealous,
I get really frustrated.
So I have to like, you know, go to the gym.
And, you know, I got to sweat it out.
Just
And Amy?
Well, I...
I feel like he's cheating on me.
Well, you just need to learn to believe that I'm not.
Uh, well, these sound like two very conflicting perspectives, obviously...
Can you put your glasses back on, please?
Of course.
Thank you.
No, no.
No, no, no.
No, don't do that.
Okay, uh, well, he never has sex with me, like at all.
It's because I don't want to.
And, Amy, how does that make you feel?
That makes me feel unattractive, Chrissy Teigen.
You know what, Kevin?
Maintaining self-esteem for a woman can be really difficult.
I think we all feel a little bit ugly sometimes.
All right, I want to try a role play.
I'm going to be Amy.
Kevin, I'd like you to say to me all the things that you'd like to do to Amy in bed.
- Okay.
- No.
I don't think that's a good idea for us.
First, I want to kiss you for hours.
And then I want to run my fingers through your long, dark hair.
And then I want to drive you crazy by licking you in places no other man, including John Legend, has ever touched before.
All right, why don't you now say those things directly to Amy?
It's okay.
I think she got it.
I don't think this is helping at all.
So it's agreed.
We're on a break.
You know what I like to do sometimes is kind of finish off the session with just one of you.
I think that would be the smartest deal here.
Okay, yeah.
Ame, you'll take a Citi Bike home, right?
I've never even used a Citi Bike.
It's really easy.
You just use a credit card.
Actually, Kevin, I think it's best if I finish with Amy.
But you know what?
My business cards are still being made.
But all my information is on this for you.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
We have a calendar.
Wow.
This has everything.
I will put this to use.
Great.
And then I will see you Monday.
Monday.
Perfect.
I will see you then.
Monday.
- All right.
See you at home.
- See you.
Girl!
Don't blow this, girl.
What?
That man out there is a total catch.
You need to lock it down.
Really?
Oh, gross.
It's a dick.
It's Kevin.
So I walk up to the desk, and she's like, "I'm Jordana."
Yes, of course, that's your name.
What a hot name, right?
My name's Amy Schumer.
Just...
Ew.
I sound like everyone's lesbian aunt, you know?
And not even the fun one.
The one you hope doesn't come to Thanksgiving 'cause she always brings her "friend" Terri, right?
And you have to make small talk like,
"So, Terri, how's bird-feeding going?
I don't know."
She's like, "Good!
They've been eating a lot.
Just put it out there, they eat it.
I don't know."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Welcome to New Body.
- Thank you.
- Can I help you?
Yeah, I just started working out this morning, so I need a little revamp on my wardrobe for the new body I'm about to have.
Oh, my God, fabulous.
What's your fitness plan?
Well, I switched to Diet Snapple and I bought a tiny house trampoline.
So, you know, a change a-gonna come.
What size are you now?
I'm a 4 at Old Navy.
- Okay, so an 8.
- Yeah.
And what size are you thinking your new body's gonna be?
Uh, I'm definitely gonna be a size 2.
Congratulations!
- That's such a great size.
- Thanks.
And is there any special occasion you're preparing for?
Yeah, I've been catfishing a guy in Michigan and sending him pictures of Kate Bosworth and saying that they're me, and we're supposed to meet up in two weeks.
I love everything about that plan.
Same.
Why don't we walk over here to the "five months from now" section?
- Okay.
- Come on.
Oh, my God, I love this.
But it's a size 0.
That's a size smaller than I was thinking my new body would be.
- But it's so cute.
- Isn't it so cute?
Doesn't it make you want to kill yourself?
- Yes!
- All right, listen to me.
If I were you, I would just make my delusional diet a little more unachievable.

I was like, "Where's the gym?"
She was like, "Do you mean Sweat?"
I was like, "'Sweat'?
No, where's your gym?"
But it was the W, so they use all these minimalist names for things.
So she's like, "Well, we call our gym Sweat.
'Cause that's what you do there."

You're watching "Gym Bummers."
Welcome to Sports Central's "Gym Bummers,"
the show about things people do at the gym that bum everyone out.
Let's kick off the show with this week's highlights.
Our first gym bummer comes to us from the Scrunch gym in Montclair, New Jersey.
Here comes supplement-pushing, unsolicited-advice guy.
Doing the double tap.
Here we go.
Having him take out his headphones.
- About to land and...
- You're doing it wrong.
Boom!
Avert your eyes, folks.
It's the codependent couple working out together.
Hey, why molest each other in the comfort of your own home when you can do it in full view of everyone?
We understand that shoulder presses are part of your foreplay, but if we wanted to watch, we'd find your YouPorn channel.
Oh, you know what that sound means.
It's time for the lightning round.
Code red, code red!
Indian guy working out in jeans.
Just gonna take a shot in the dark here...
I don't think this gentleman's gonna shower after this gym visit.
Woman who dresses like Mr. Mistoffelees from the musical "Cats."
Guy who picks the treadmill right next to you when there's plenty available and runs sideways facing you.
Man, I don't think it's true that poodles are the smartest.
Well, he's got nothing to say but wants everyone to hear it.
That's a rare double bummer.
It's the classic grunt and drop.
Raah!
Rah!
Yeah!
Ugh.
Easy, Drago.
No one's invading your village.
And that's the end of the lightning round.
Whew, well, now it's time for Bummer of the Week.
A fully dressed couple who just checked into a hotel are surveying the gym.
They didn't even bring gym clothes.
"Yeah, wow, honey.
There are a lot of towels in here."
Stop lying to yourselves.
You're never gonna use it.
You're never gonna use it!
And that's all the time we have.
Tune in next week
Locker Room Edition,"
where a naked old guy with a hanging scrotum blow-dries his hair for 90 minutes.
See you then.
Jed, you were a weed delivery boy.
I was.
How long were you delivering drugs for?
For like a year.
What's the statute of limitations?
Like should I be talking about this right now?
Right.
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God.
- Good luck.
To both of us.
- Thank you.
I will get you out.
I just signed something that said you wouldn't.
Well, fuck you, then.
No, just kidding.
Okay, so how did you get into the biz?
A friend of mine was doing it and then he quit and let me take his place.
- A position opened up.
- Yeah.
Was the person interviewing you scary as shit?
He wasn't.
He was really excited that I had a bike,
I owned a backpack, and that I was white.
Who wouldn't be?
What a great combo.
And he was like, "Oh, my God, I'm so psyched you're white."
And you were like, "Me too!"
I think that you smell great, but why do so many drug delivery guys smell like shit?
Maybe 'cause of the sweat and the running around and riding their bike through New York City streets.
I ran over a cup once, and piss came out of it onto me.
And so that probably happens a lot.
Tell me about that.
I just saw a cup in the middle of the street, standing up, when I was riding my bike, so I ran over it, and it just showered my body with piss.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry 'cause that's not funny, but it's really making me laugh.
Did you ever deliver to any celebrities?
No.
- Really?
- Really?

Okay.
What would be your ideal thing?
I'm a cartoonist and a freelance illustrator mostly.

Recently I'm working on one about when I used to be a weed delivery boy.
Oh, nice.
What's it called?
Uh, it's called "Weed Delivery Boy."
- Bam.
- I know.
So far.
Simple, clear, you.
Never again, Miami.
But from Miami, I went to Tennessee, and there I'm Jordana, okay?
Yeah.
Feel it.
People are like, "What are those?"
I was like, "Teeth.
Hi."
They were like, "How'd you do that?"
I was like, "A razor."
Sorry, I was just thinking about you.
What's this song called?
- Did you press the button or?
- Oh, sorry.

Hello.
Hi, I'm Chrissy Teigen.
I'm so sorry about the wait.
Come on in.
Thank you so much for seeing us.
No problem.
It's gonna be fine.
So let's get started.
First of all, how long have you two been together?
Four years.
Well, we had a good run, if that's what you mean.
Well, I think it's great you guys are both here.
It shows that this relationship is something that's important to the both of you.
I'm sorry, aren't you a model?
She's a supermodel.
You sound like a real ass(bleep) right now.
I actually was a model, but now I'm a clinical social worker and I really love it.
You know, I'm really enjoying this now and I mean, who wants to ride a horse naked for the camera all the time?
I'd rather just do that on my own.
And as you know, modeling is great, but you hit 27 and suddenly, you're old.
Oh, that's not old.
Amy's 37.
I'm 32.
Yeah, but you're a drinker.
All right, so let's talk about what brought you two here.
I'll start.
Um...
You know, when, when Amy gets jealous,
I get really frustrated.
So I have to like, you know, go to the gym and then I gotta sweat it out.
Just... (growls)
And Amy?
Well, I, I feel like he's cheating on me.
You just need to learn to believe that I'm not.
Uh, well, these sound like two very conflicting perspectives, obviously--
Can you put your glasses back on, please?
Of course.
Thank you.
No, no.
No, no, no.
No, don't do that.
Okay, uh, well, he never has sex with me, like at all.
It's because I don't want to.
And Amy, how does that make you feel?
That makes me feel unattractive, Chrissy Teigen.
You know what, Kevin, maintaining self-esteem for a woman can be really difficult.
I think we all feel a little bit ugly sometimes.
All right, I want to try a role play.
I'm going to be Amy.
Kevin, I'd like you to say to me all the things that you'd like to do to Amy in bed.
- Okay--
- No.
I don't think that's a good idea for us--
First, I want to kiss you for hours.
And then I want to run my fingers through your long, dark hair.
And then I wanna drive you crazy by licking you in places no other man, including John Legend, has ever touched before.
All right, why don't you now say those things directly to Amy?
It's okay.
I think she got it.
I don't think this is helping at all.
So it's agreed.
We're on a break.
You know what I like to do sometimes is kind of finish off the session with just one of you.
I think that would be the smartest deal here.
Okay, yeah.
Amy, you'll take a Citi Bike home, right?
I've never even used a Citi Bike.
It's really easy.
You just use a credit card.
Actually, Kevin, I think it's best if I finish with Amy, but, um, you know what?
My business cards are still being made.
But all my information is on this for you.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
We have a calendar--
Wow, this has everything.
I will put this to use.
Great, and then I will see you Monday.
Monday.
Perfect.
I will see you then.

Girl, don't blow this, girl.

And now I will show you to your room.
You're an angel, and it's my great honor to breathe the same air as you.
Now, this is Soak, our pool experience.
Over here we have Splay, our lounge area.
Oh, wow.
Oh, I would have had more of that.
And right here is Soar, which will take us to your room.
Oh, I love your shoes.
Everything about you is just so on point.
Thank you.
I love rolling this bag around.
'Cause it's yours.
Welcome home.
This is huge.
You could fit three people in here.
This is too fancy for me.
No, don't say that.
No.
This is all about you.
You deserve this.
You make Kate Middleton look like a mental patient shitting herself in a rusty wheelchair.
Right this way.
All of our water is pumped in from virginal koi ponds where two beautiful swans are making love for the first time.
Our ceramic sustainable infinity toilet has an orgasm every time you flush.
[Flushes]
TOILET:
Ohh, yes!
I never have to fake It with you, Amy.
You look radiant.
Take a look at yourself in the mirror.
See what I see.
Wait, why is it...
Why aren't you in the mirror?
Oh, it doesn't reflect the staff.
We're nothing.
I'm shit.
Look at me running my mouth off like a stupid dumb bitch.
Anyway, you must be exhausted.
I'll leave you alone.
Okay.
[Sighs]
- Hello, angel.
- Oh, my God.
Can I tuck you in?
- Uh, you don't have to...
- Oh, I want to.
Oh.
Now, would you like to be awakened by a soft kiss on the cheek or a stranger going down on you?
Oh, I don't k-know.
I guess the latter?
Okay, we can just feel it out in the moment, then.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
- Anything?
- Um...
Well, I hate to ask, but I usually sleep with a white-noise machine...
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
- I really prefer...
- Whale noises?
That's my specialty.
[Imitating whale call]
We have standards, guys.
What do we serve stuff In?
Glassware, correct?
No red cups.
Come on!
[Knock on door]
WOMAN:
Housekeeping.
I'll be out in a minute!
WOMAN:
Chop-chop!
So, what's going on In the bar right now?
Are they out of glassware?
[Sighs] Good morning.
Late checkout?
- Is it?
- It's after 11:00.
I'm going to have to charge you for another day.
It's like five after.
Should I just leave that all on the Visa?
- It's me.
- All on the Visa, ma'am?
Yeah, I guess...
This woman is no longer a guest at the hotel.
She's done.
She's done talking to you.
This way, ma'am.
She's done.
Oh, no, no.
I think she just didn't recognize me.
Wait.
Let me just...
- Hi, I'm checking in.
- Oh, I love that scarf.
Is that Egyptian silk?
Everything about you is just so on point.
Wait!
It's me!
It's me!
Please!
I go to the front desk at the Dub and, of course, the girl working there is just, like, gorgeous, just this fiery [Spanish accent] Latina.
Just amazing, just, like, tan Khaleesi.
You know, just...
Skinny.
She looked like this with perfect tits.
Just...
They were so high.
She's like resting her chin on them.
She's like, "Mmm..."
She's like, "This is why I can't read."
- Like, struggling...
- [Laughter] ...with her own titties.
She was so hot.
She was like, "Can I help you?
Mnnnh!"
Like, only Latina chicks can do that, right?
Like, they're so sexy.
It always sounds like they're waking up from, like, a grumpy nap, you know?
Just, "Mnnnh!
I'm mad.
I don't know why.
Mnnh."
So hot, right?
Everything they say, it sounds like they're coming.
It doesn't matter how mundane.
It could be like, "I have to go to the Laundromat."'
You're like, "Oh, my God, are you coming, talking about your dirty clothes right now?"
Can you imagine if I tried to do that as a white chick?
[Whining] "Where's the Laundromat?"
Ew!
You white monster, shut up!
[Laughter]
This is gonna be good.
Do we really have to do this?
Yes.
We're not communicating.
We need help.
We're not communicating?
Yeah.
We're not communicating.
I don't even know what you're saying right now.
[Door opens]
Hello.
Hi, I'm Chrissy Teigen.
I'm so sorry about the wait.
Come on in.
Thank you so much for seeing us.
No problem.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine.
So, let's get started.
First of all, how long have you two been together?
Four years.
We had a good run, if that's what you mean.
Well, I think it's great you guys are both here.
It shows that this relationship is something that's important to the both of you.
I'm sorry...
Aren't you a model?
She's a supermodel.
You sound like a real asshole right now.
I actually was a model, but now I'm a clinical social worker, and I really love it.
You know, I'm really enjoying this now.
And, I mean, who wants to ride a horse naked for the camera all the time?
I'd rather just do that on my own.
And as you know, modeling is great, but you hit 27 and suddenly you're old.
Oh, that's not old.
- Amy's 37.
- I'm 32.
Yeah, but you're a drinker.
All right, so let's talk about what brought you two here.
I'll start.
Um...
You know, when... when Amy gets jealous,
I get really frustrated.
So I have to like, you know, go to the gym.
And, you know, I got to sweat it out.
Just [Growls]
And Amy?
Well, I...
I feel like he's cheating on me.
Well, you just need to learn to believe that I'm not.
Uh, well, these sound like two very conflicting perspectives, obviously...
Can you put your glasses back on, please?
Of course.
Thank you.
No, no.
No, no, no.
No, don't do that.
Okay, uh, well, he never has sex with me, like at all.
It's because I don't want to.
And, Amy, how does that make you feel?
That makes me feel unattractive, Chrissy Teigen.
You know what, Kevin?
Maintaining self-esteem for a woman can be really difficult.
I think we all feel a little bit ugly sometimes.
All right, I want to try a role play.
I'm going to be Amy.
Kevin, I'd like you to say to me all the things that you'd like to do to Amy in bed.
- Okay.
- No.
I don't think that's a good idea for us.
First, I want to kiss you for hours.
And then I want to run my fingers through your long, dark hair.
And then I want to drive you crazy by licking you in places no other man, including John Legend, has ever touched before.
All right, why don't you now say those things directly to Amy?
It's okay.
I think she got it.
I don't think this is helping at all.
So it's agreed.
We're on a break.
You know what I like to do sometimes is kind of finish off the session with just one of you.
I think that would be the smartest deal here.
Okay, yeah.
Ame, you'll take a Citi Bike home, right?
I've never even used a Citi Bike.
It's really easy.
You just use a credit card.
Actually, Kevin, I think it's best if I finish with Amy.
But you know what?
My business cards are still being made.
But all my information is on this for you.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
AMY:
We have a calendar.
KEVIN:
Wow.
This has everything.
I will put this to use.
Great.
And then I will see you Monday.
Monday.
Perfect.
I will see you then.
Monday.
- All right.
See you at home.
- See you.
Girl!
Don't blow this, girl.
What?
That man out there is a total catch.
You need to lock it down.
- Really?
- [Cellphone chimes]
Oh, gross.
It's a dick.
It's Kevin.
So I walk up to the desk, and she's like, "I'm Jordana."
Yes, of course, that's your name.
What a hot name, right?
My name's Amy Schumer.
Just...
[Laughter]
Ew.
I sound like everyone's lesbian aunt, you know?
And not even the fun one.
The one you hope doesn't come to Thanksgiving 'cause she always brings her "friend" Terri, right?
[Laughter]
And you have to make small talk like,
"So, Terri, how's bird-feeding going?
I don't know."
She's like, "Good!
They've been eating a lot.
[Laughter and applause]
Just put it out there, they eat it.
I don't know."
- Hi.
- Hi.
Welcome to New Body.
- Thank you.
- Can I help you?
Yeah, I just started working out this morning, so I need a little revamp on my wardrobe for the new body I'm about to have.
Oh, my God, fabulous.
What's your fitness plan?
Well, I switched to Diet Snapple and I bought a tiny house trampoline.
So, you know, a change a-gonna come.
What size are you now?
I'm a 4 at Old Navy.
- Okay, so an 8.
- Yeah.
And what size are you thinking your new body's gonna be?
Uh, I'm definitely gonna be a size 2.
[Gasps] Congratulations!
- That's such a great size.
- Thanks.
And is there any special occasion you're preparing for?
Yeah, I've been catfishing a guy in Michigan and sending him pictures of Kate Bosworth and saying that they're me, and we're supposed to meet up in two weeks.
I love everything about that plan.
Same.
Why don't we walk over here to the "five months from now" section?
- Okay.
- Come on.
Oh, my God, I love this.
But it's a size 0.
That's a size smaller than I was thinking my new body would be.
- But it's so cute.
- Isn't it so cute?
Doesn't it make you want to kill yourself?
- Yes!
- All right, listen to me.
If I were you, I would just make my delusional diet a little more unachievable.
Then it will hang on you.
- Okay, why not?
- Why not?
Do you have a place where I can sit and eat this muffin?
Oh, sure.
Right over there.
♪ So what?
♪
♪ I messed it up ♪
♪ I said too much, I pushed my luck ♪
♪ So what?
♪
♪ I screamed too loud... ♪
How's it going in there?
Be honest.
Honestly, I love this for future you.
You need to wear this when all your lies are exposed in Michigan.
That's what I was thinking!
The best part about it is, it's so easy.
So easy.
Also, is there a place I can sit and eat this other muffin?
It's my cheat day.
Oh, yeah, right where you had the first one.
Thanks.
Amazing.
Um, this was unrealistic.
No returns!
[Spanish accent] "Jordana."
I was like, "Where's the gym?"
She was like, "Do you mean Sweat?"
I was like, "'Sweat'?
No, where's your gym?"
But it was the W, so they use all these minimalist names for things.
So she's like, "Well, we call our gym Sweat.
'Cause that's what you do there."
I was like, "Oh, that makes sense."
Like, "Well, where's Shit?" Um...
[Laughter]
"Is Shit on this floor, or...
Are we permitted to do that in Sweat?"
Um...
[Up-tempo rock music playing]
AMY:
Whoa!
Save some for the fish!
You're watching "Gym Bummers."
Welcome to Sports Central's "Gym Bummers,"
the show about things people do at the gym that bum everyone out.
Let's kick off the show with this week's highlights.
AMY:
Our first gym bummer comes to us from the Scrunch gym in Montclair, New Jersey.
Here comes supplement-pushing, unsolicited-advice guy.
Doing the double tap.
Here we go.
Having him take out his headphones.
- About to land and...
- You're doing it wrong.
AMY:
Boom!
Avert your eyes, folks.
It's the codependent couple working out together.
MAN:
Hey, why molest each other in the comfort of your own home when you can do it in full view of everyone?
AMY:
We understand that shoulder presses are part of your foreplay, but if we wanted to watch, we'd find your YouPorn channel.
[Alarm sounds]
Oh, you know what that sound means.
It's time for the lightning round.
MAN:
Code red, code red!
Indian guy working out in jeans.
AMY:
Just gonna take a shot in the dark here...
I don't think this gentleman's gonna shower after this gym visit.
Woman who dresses like Mr. Mistoffelees from the musical "Cats."
Guy who picks the treadmill right next to you when there's plenty available and runs sideways facing you.
Man, I don't think it's true that poodles are the smartest.
Well, he's got nothing to say but wants everyone to hear it.
That's a rare double bummer.
AMY:
It's the classic grunt and drop.
Raah!
Rah!
Yeah!
AMY:
Ugh.
MAN:
Easy, Drago.
No one's invading your village.
And that's the end of the lightning round.
Whew, well, now it's time for Bummer of the Week.
MAN:
A fully dressed couple who just checked into a hotel are surveying the gym.
AMY:
They didn't even bring gym clothes.
"Yeah, wow, honey.
There are a lot of towels in here."
Stop lying to yourselves.
You're never gonna use it.
You're never gonna use it!
And that's all the time we have.
Tune in next week for "Gym Bummers:
Locker Room Edition,"
where a naked old guy with a hanging scrotum blow-dries his hair for 90 minutes.
See you then.
Jed, you were a weed delivery boy.
I was.
How long were you delivering drugs for?
For like a year.
What's the statute of limitations?
Like should I be talking about this right now?
Right.
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God.
- Good luck.
To both of us.
- Thank you.
I will get you out.
I just signed something that said you wouldn't.
Well, fuck you, then.
No, just kidding.
Okay, so how did you get into the biz?
A friend of mine was doing it and then he quit and let me take his place.
- A position opened up.
- Yeah.
Was the person interviewing you scary as shit?
He wasn't.
He was really excited that I had a bike,
I owned a backpack, and that I was white.
[Laughs]
Who wouldn't be?
What a great combo.
And he was like, "Oh, my God, I'm so psyched you're white."
And you were like, "Me too!"
I think that you smell great, but why do so many drug delivery guys smell like shit?
Maybe 'cause of the sweat and the running around and riding their bike through New York City streets.
I ran over a cup once, and piss came out of it onto me.
And so that probably happens a lot.
Tell me about that.
I just saw a cup in the middle of the street, standing up, when I was riding my bike, so I ran over it, and it just showered my body with piss.
Oh, I'm sorry.
[Laughs]
I'm sorry 'cause that's not funny, but it's really making me laugh.
Did you ever deliver to any celebrities?
No.
- Really?
- Really?
- Really?
- No.
- No?
No?
No?
No?
No?
No?
No?
- No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Okay.
What would be your ideal thing?
I'm a cartoonist and a freelance illustrator mostly.
What cartoons?
Recently I'm working on one about when I used to be a weed delivery boy.
Oh, nice.
What's it called?
Uh, it's called "Weed Delivery Boy."
- Bam.
- I know.
So far.
Simple, clear, you.
[Laughs]
Never again, Miami.
But from Miami, I went to Tennessee, and there I'm Jordana, okay?
- Yeah.
- [Cheers and applause]
Feel it.
People are like, "What are those?"
I was like, "Teeth.
Hi."
[Laughter]
They were like, "How'd you do that?"
I was like, "A razor."
[Laughter]
Sorry, I was just thinking about you.
[Laughs]
- [Dance music playing]
- What's this song called?
[Laughs]
[Dance music playing]
- Did you press the button or?
- Oh, sorry.
[Laughter]
[Sighing]
- [Sighs]
- TEIGEN: [Laughing]

Tonight, a country brought to its knees.
A 7.2 magnitude earthquake has hit Haiti.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, was literally torn apart.
The earthquake lasted all of a minute.
The intensity so strong, within seconds a cloud of dust covered the city.
And many people are still trapped in the rubble.
Some may still be alive, but getting out alive will be There's truly no way of knowing just how many people are dead.
Bodies are reportedly stacked in streets.
It's feared the number of people killed could now reach 200,000.
200,000 children without a mother or father even before this earthquake.
A country which only seems to know the worst of times is tonight just trying to survive.
-Mama!

I LIKE PUERTO RICAN CHINESE GIRLS.

WE'RE ADOPTING ONE.
THE LITTLE GIRL YOU SAW US ON THE BEACH WITH,
SHE'S A HAITIAN REFUGEE.
AND WE'RE ADOPTING HER.
- OH, THAT'S LOVELY.

DID YOU EVER SPEND ANY TIME DOWN THERE?
LIKE--
NO, NOT THAT REGION.
YOU?
YEAH, I SPENT SOME TIME DOWN THERE.

IT'S A GREAT THING WHAT YOU'RE DOING, MAN.

ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I TOLD SHANNON
I'D BE FIVE MINUTES, SO I'M GONNA HEAD OUT.

IT'S BASIC PUERTO RICAN MANNERS.
WE GET YOU A ROUND, YOU GET US A ROUND.
YOU OWE US A ROUND.
SEE, WE GOT YOU THE FIRST ROUND.
NOW, YOU GET US THE SECOND ROUND.
I UNDERSTAND, OKAY.
I CAN-

SALO'S GOT A LOT OF RULES.
THAT'S NOT A RULE.
COME ON, MAN.
- CAN I GET ANOTHER ROUND OF WHAT HE ORDERED?
- FOUR-AND-FOUR.
EXACTLY.
THERE'S ETIQUETTES EVERYWHERE.
IS IT EXPENSIVE?
- WHAT'S THAT?
- WELL, THE WHOLE PROCESS.
YOU KNOW, CUTTING THROUGH ALL THE RED TAPE.
UM, I SUPPOSE IF ONE DOES,
BUT WE WENT A MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD ROUTE.
NO, I MEAN, IS IT HARD--
LIKE, DO YOU HAVE TO NEED AN EXPEDITOR
OR DO THEY BILK YOU FOR MORE AND MORE MONEY
OR ANYTHING?
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I-- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT.THE WAITING IS DIFFICULT.
YOU KNOW, BUT...
- THERE IT IS.
- YOU GUYS HAVING ANOTHER?
YEAH.
HERE, BROTHER.
YOU GOT TO DRINK THAT.
UM, LET'S SEE.
UM, THIS SHOULD COVER
BOTH ROUNDS.
YOU GUYS HAVE A GREAT EVENING.
ALL RIGHT, BUD.
- IS THAT FOR ME, DUDE?
- WE'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?
- SHANNON, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
- HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, I PROMISE.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE.
YOU CALL ME FROM A POLICE STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME JUST WALK OUT OF HERE ON MY OWN.
I HAD NO CHOICE.
IT'S THE WAY THEY DO THINGS HERE.
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?
NO, THE GUY DUMPED BEER ON ME.
IT WAS THE WEIRD PEOPLE FROM THE CABIN THAT WE KEEP RUNNING INTO.
THEY JUST TWISTED THE STORY ALL AROUND.
SIR.
SIGN HERE, WILL YOU PLEASE?
IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?
ARE WE REALLY BACK HERE?
I DIDN'T DO--
NINA, UM...
OUI.
NINA, I'M SORRY
MOMMY HAD TO WAKE YOU UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.
YEAH?
HELLO.
HEARD IT WAS THE WILD, WILD WEST OUT THERE, HUH?
IT WAS, UM, A MISUNDERSTANDING.
YEAH, YOU HAD A RUN-IN WITH SOME TROUBLEMAKERS, I UNDERSTAND?
YES, ACTUALLY, I DID.
I WAS ATTACKED FOR NO REASON.
I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT TO YOUR OFFICERS.
YEAH, WELL, A NICE FAMILY LIKE YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT TYPE OF NONSENSE.
LIFE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT COMPLICATED.
THAT'S MY CARD IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
AND WHO MIGHT THIS LITTLEFLORECITA BE?
IT'S OUR DAUGHTER, NINA.
LOVELY.
WELL, LOOK, WE REALLY LOVE TOURISTS HERE,
SO PLEASE ENJOY YOURSELVES.
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR-- STAY OUT OF BARS FOR AWHILE, OKAY?
YES, SIR.
YOU UP?
YEAH.
BABY, I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I...
WHAT I REALLY THINK WOULD MAKE
EVERYTHING BETTER?
WHAT?
PANCAKES.
OKAY.
- THAT'S EASY.
- I'M THE WORLD'S CHEAPEST DATE.
YOU ORDER PANCAKES, I'LL SEE IF NINA'S AWAKE.
OKAY.
NINA, HONEY.
NINA, HONEY.
STEVEN!
SHE'S NOT UP HERE!
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE'S NOT HERE?
NINA!
HONEY?
NINA.
NINA!
HER SHOES ARE GONE!
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
SHE'S NOT HERE.
- NINA!
- NINA!
NINA!
- I'LL ASK RECEPTION.
- OKAY.
- NINA!
- NINA!
HI.
I'M LOOKING FOR MY DAUGHTER.
SHE WAS IN HER ROOM.
SHE'S BEEN MISSING-- I DON'T KNOW FOR HOW LONG.
- NINA!
- SHE'S SEVEN YEARS OLD,
SHE'S ABOUT THIS TALL.
-EXCUSEME ,SIR, CAN I HELP YOU?
YEAH, OUR DAUGHTER'S MISSING.
OKAY, HOW OLD IS SHE?
UH, SHE'S SEVEN, SHE'S HAITIAN.
MAYBE YOU SAW HER COME THROUGH THE LOBBY?
I'M SORRY.
- SHE WAS WEARING--
- SHE WAS WEARING, UH, PINK PAJAMA PANTS
- WITH POLKA DOTS AND A BLUE T-SHIRT.
- OKAY, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.
YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE ONES, THEY GO WHERE THEY WANT
AND SUDDENLY THEY TURN UP, SO...
- OH MY GOD, STEVEN!
- ...
NOT TO WORRY.
- SIR?
SIR?
- THE POOL!
- SHE'S IN THE POOL!
- SIR?
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
SOMEONE ON YOUR STAFF HAD TO SEE HER.
MR. MAYER, THERE'S CERTAIN PROTOCOL
THAT WE FOLLOW HERE, AND WE'RE DOING THAT.
GETTING ANGRY WITH THE STAFF?
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP.
- WHAT ABOUT SECURITY FOOTAGE?
- WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.
SHE CAN'T HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED.
CHILDREN DO WANDER OFF.
WHAT?
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD WITH A COMPLEX PAST,
BRAND NEW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES,
BEWILDERED, OVERWHELMED.
WE'RE LOOKING INTOnEVERY POSSIBILITY.
AND CONSIDERING THE CONFLICT THE OTHER NIGHT,
WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THAT.
CAN YOU MAKE A LIST OF OTHER PLACES YOU'VE BEEN
SINCE YOU ARRIVED AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MET?
AND ALSO, DO YOU HAVE ANY PHOTOS OF NINA?
I'LL GET MY COMPUTER.
IF SHE DID WANDER OFF ALONE,
SHE'S PROBABLY OUT THERE HUNGRY BY NOW.
SOMEONE HAS TO NOTICEnA LITTLE GIRL ALL ALONE.
WHAT ABOUT THE ADOPTION AGENCY?
- HOW WELL DID THEY KNOW HER?
- WE'VE BEEN CALLING THEM.
WE'RE WAITING FOR NINA'S PASSPORT TO COME THROUGH.
THEY DIDN'T ANSWER YESTERDAY.
I'M TRYING TO BRING UP HER PROFILE PICTURE ON THE WEBSITE, BUT...
THERE'S NO WEBSITE.
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THIS ADOPTION?
UH... $60,000.
EXCUSE ME.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.
I'M SORRY.
WE'VE BEEN PARENTS FOR 48 HOURS.
SHE COULDN'T HAVE WALKED OUT ON US, COULD SHE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN, SHE COULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO, RIGHT?
SHE SEEMED SO HAPPY.
ALL I EVER WANTED TO BE WAS A MOTHER.
PRETEND WITH MY LITTLE SISTER,
I'D...
BATHE HER AND FEED HER
AND TUCK HER IN AT NIGHT.
I SWORE THAT WHEN I HAD KIDS OF MY OWN
I WOULD NEVER ABANDON THEM
THE WAY THAT MY BIRTH MOTHER--
MOTHER ABANDONED ME.
SO WE HAVE TO FIND HER, OKAY?
WE WILL, OKAY?
WE WILL.
I JUST-- BECAUSE--
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, STEVEN,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
I'M GOING BACK TO THAT OFFICE.
YOU THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?
NO ONE'S ANSWERING THE PHONE,
THE WEBSITE'S DOWN.
I'M GONNA GO CONFRONT HER DIRECTLY.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LET THE COPS HANDLE THAT.
THE COPS DON'T CARE, SHANNON.
WE'RE TOURISTS.
THEY GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS OF THEIR OWN.
- JUST-
- JUST KEEP LOOKING.
- OKAY, GO.
I'LL KEEP LOOKING, OKAY.
WHAT THE FUCK?
NINA?
PERDON.
- YEAH.
- MRS. MAYER.
- YOU HAD SOME NEW INFO?
WELL, WE CONTACTED THE CONSULATE
AND YOUR PAPERWORK WAS NEVER PROCESSED.
NO GABRIELLE REIGERT
OR NINA DUVALIER.
THAT HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.
LET ME GUESS.
SHE TOLD YOU SHE WOULD CONTACT YOU
WHEN YOUR PASSPORT CAME IN,
SO ALL NINA HAD TO DO WAS WANDER OFF
AT THE APPOINTED TIME INTO HER WAITING ARMS.
NO, UM...
NO, OUR ROOM WAS LOCKED.
WE WOULD'VE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN.
THE SCAM IS CALLED RECLAIMING.
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT RARE.
WHAT THEY DO,
THEY GET AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN,
TAKE THE KID BACK,
ON TO THE NEXT VICTIM.
NEW WEB SITE, NEW CITY, NEW COUNTRY.
- IT'S VERY HARD TO TRACK.
IT'S ALL OVER ASIA NOW.
- THIS WEBSITE HAD, UM--
IT HAD ALL THESE, UH,
LINKS, AND IT HAD TESTIMONIALS.
WELL, WEBSITES WILL DO THAT.
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?
SIR, SIR...
NO, NO.
UH, JUST KEEP THAT.
THANK YOU.
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.
HE'S OUT LOOKING FOR HER.
YEAH, WE HEARD ABOUT A BREAK-IN IN OLD SAN JUAN.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.
WE DON'T NEED VIGILANTES.
WE'RE GONNA FIND THE GIRL.
COMANDANTE, THIS, UM--
THIS SCAM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT...
IT MIGHT BE TRUE...
BUT IT ALSO MIGHT NOT BE.
- SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING FOR HER.
- WE WILL KEEP LOOKING.
- YOU HAVE TO FIND HER.
- WE WILL.
SORRY, HAVE YOU SEEN THIS LITTLE GIRL?
SORRY, I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL.
ESTA NIÑA.
UM, HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
ESTA NIÑA.
CAN YOU-
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER?
THIS LITTLE GIRL,nHAVE YOU SEEN HER?
I DID A REALLY STUPID THING, SHANNON.
WE DID A STUPID THING.
NO, I DID.
YOU LOOKED SO HAPPY.
WE JUST FINISHED PAINTING HER ROOM.
EVERYTHING WAS SET.
AND THEN I GET AN EMAIL OUT OF NOWHERE
SAYING THE WHOLE THING FELL APART.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SHE SAID SHE COULD MAKE IT GO AWAY.
SHE-
- SHE SAID NO ONE WOULD KNOW...
SO I PAID HER.
WE'D ALREADY PAID.
I PAID HER MORE TO MAKE IT WORK.
HOW MUCH MORE?
ANOTHER 30.
FUCK.
FUCK, STEVEN.
STEVEN, YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU BOUGHT OUR DAUGHTER ON THE BLACK MARKET.
NO, NO.
NO.
SHE WAS AN OFFICIAL EXPEDITOR, SHANNON.
SHE HAD-- YOU SAW HER CREDENTIALS,
AND THAT OFFICE.
BABY, WE WERE SO CLOSE.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
WHAT ABOUT RUN IT BY ME?
COMMUNICATE?
I WANTED EVERYTHING TO WORK OUT.
AND SO WHAT?
YOU DECIDED THAT YOU WOULD
JUST TAKE SHORTCUTS AS USUAL?
WE WERE ON A WAITING LIST BACK HOME, REMEMBER?
ANOTHER TWO TO THREE MORE YEARS.
I WAS FINE TO WAIT.
OH, SURE, YOU WERE FINE TO WAIT.
IF YOU ALREADY PAID HER,
WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST NOT SHOW UP?
FUCK.
WHAT?
THERE WERE...
ADDITIONAL FEES...
THIS WEEK.
THE MONEY CAME THROUGH YESTERDAY.
- I GUESS SHE WAS WAITING...
- ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?
...AND THE PASSPORT STORY WAS THERE TO JUST STRING US ALONG.
MORE THAN THE 30?
NOT AS MUCH-- ANOTHER 10.
WE'RE NEVER GONNA SEE HER AGAIN.
MAYBE SHE WAS NEVER OURS.
- MAYBE NONE OF THIS WAS REAL.
- IT WAS REAL.
YOU FELT IT TOO, DIDN'T YOU?
YEAH, I THOUGHT I DID.
BUT...
IS SHE...
DOES SHE EVEN BELONG TO US, LEGALLY?
IF THIS IS A SCAM, IF THEY'RE CRIMINALS,
- DO WE EVEN STICK AROUND?
- SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL.
SHE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE
WITH GOD KNOWS WHAT KINDS OF PEOPLE.
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR DAUGHTER.
DOESN'T THAT MEAN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TRY?
OF COURSE IT DOES.
YES.
LET'S-- LET'S DRIVE AROUND SOME MORE.
I JUST-- I NEED SOME TIME, OKAY?
YOU DRIVE AROUND.
SHIT.
- HEY, SHANNON.
- SHANNON?
IT'S BENJAMIN AND VERONICA.
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY WE'RE REALLY SORRY...
- I KNOW THAT.
...FOR WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT.
IT WAS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING,
I KNOW STEVEN DIDN'T PICK A FIGHT WITH YOU.HE'S SO PASSIVE, HE WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.
HE DIDN'T PICK A FIGHT WITH ME,
IT WAS MY BUDDY SALO, ANYWAY.
WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T DRINK.
LOOK, MY DAUGHTER'S MISSING, SO I DON'T--
CAN WE JUST NOT?
YOU'RE DAUGHTER'S MISSING?
WHERE IS SHE?
YEAH, IT'S ALL-- IT'S ALL PART OF SOME SCAM.
A SCAM?
YEAH, THESE PEOPLE, THEY JUST-
- THEY, UM...
THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE GIRL,
THEY GET A 100 GRAND FROM YOU...
AND THEN THEY TAKE HER BACK.
100 GRAND?
OH MY GOD.
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- DID YOU TALK TO THE POLICE?
- YEAH, I CALLED THE COPS.
- WHAT DID THEY SAY?
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?
- WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
HOW DO YOU NOT TELL ME ABOUT SOMETHING THAT BIG--
SHANNON, I KNEW IF I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE MONEY YOU WOULD'VE JUST--
IF YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE MONEY,
I WOULD'VE SAID IT WAS A BAD IDEA.
YEAH, OKAY, WELL, I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING A GOOD DECISION FOR US.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT DOING SOMETHING GOOD.
IT'S ABOUT YOUR COMPLETE LACK OF JUDGMENT.
THANKS.
A MARRIAGE IS A PARTNERSHIP, OKAY?
YOU NEVER TALK TO ME!
WE ARE STILL GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS.
I KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
- I'M CALLING THE POLICE.
- WAIT.
BENJAMIN HAS HER.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I CAN TAKE YOU TO HER.
WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU?
WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER OPTION.
IS SHE OKAY?
SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S JUST SCARED.
- WHY ARE YOU HELPING US?
- YEAH.
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.
SAY A FUCKING WORD I'M GONNA BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF, OKAY?
- GO TO THE WALL.
PUT YOUR HANDS UP ON THE WALL.
AGAINST THE WALL NOW!
HANDS DOWN.
SHH.
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.
GET THE TAPE.
BE QUIET.
THANK YOU.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, STAY THERE.
WALLET?
ALL RIGHT.
HOTEL ROOM KEY.
CHECK THEM OUT,
YOU DRIVE THEIR RENTAL CAR.
SEE YOU THERE.
LET'S MOVE.
FEET UP.
WELCOME TO YOUR PUERTO RICAN VACATIONS, MOTHERFUCKERS.
GET THE FUCK OUT!
HURRY UP!
MOVE.
MOVE.
MOVE, YOU FUCKING GRINGO.
MOVE, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
SIT DOWN.
SIT THE FUCK DOWN!
SIT THE FUCK DOWN!
MOTHERFUCKER, I WILL SHOOT YOUR FUCKING BRAINS OUT.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH NINA?
SHE'S FINE, REALLY.
NINA'S FINE, NO PROBLEM.
PLEASE, JUST TELL US WHAT YOU WANT.
nail IN GOOD TIME.
SO YOU GOT SOMEBODY IN CHICAGO
THAT LOOKS AFTER YOUR MONEY?
- OUR MONEY?
- YEAH.
SHANNON, YOU COME FROM MONEY.
AND YOU HAD A BIGnFUCKING PILE OF IT
EVEN BEFOREnTHE ACCIDENT, RIGHT?
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.
REALLY?
$2.9 MILLION SETTLEMENT?
THINK I'M A FUCKING MORON?
AUGUST 12th, 2010, "CHICAGO SUN TIMES,"
"CHICAGO WOMAN RECEIVESCIVIL SETTLEMENTnIN CITY TRAGEDY.
LATE AFTERNOONnIT WAS RULED
THAT THE COOKE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKSWAS AT FAULT WHEN A WASTE DISPOSAL TRUCK
COLLIDED WITH SHANNON MAYER, 27, OF OAK PARK..."
PLEASE, STOP IT.
- "...
CLAIMING THE LIFE OF HER UNBORN DAUGHTER."
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
- AND YOU LOST THE ABILITY TO BEAR MORE CHILDREN.
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU HAVE MONEY.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT?
I MEAN, YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS THE EXTRAVAGANT TYPE.
WE-
- WE BOUGHT A HOUSE.
WE, UM-
- WE REBUILT A LIFE.
WE STARTEDnA CHARITABLE TRUST.
- WE ADOPTED NINA.
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID?
YOU INVESTED.
- RIGHT?
- HE'S A TOY DESIGNER.
WE DON'T REALLYnMAKE THAT MUCH,
AND I HAVEN'T WORKEDnSINCE THE ACCIDENT.
WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS DO YOU MAKE?
ALL RIGHT, YOU DIDN'T WORK AFTER THE ACCIDENT?
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN, THERE'S NOTHING THERE.
STEVEN...
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A SMART GUY.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON HERE.
YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN, GABRIELLE REIGERT?
THAT'S NOT HER REAL NAME.
HER REAL NAME IS ANGIE.
SO THIS FUNNY, LITTLE WOMAN
COMES UP TO ME IN SOME SHIT-HOLE,
BUSINESS-CLASS AIRPORT LOUNGE
AND SAYS, "COME DO THIS THING."
"WHO IS THIS WOMAN?" I'M THINKING.
"WHAT IS SHE, FUCKING INTEL?
WHAT IS SHE, BLACKWATER?
CHRISTIAN OUTREACH?"
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.
SHE SAYS, "I PAY CASH.
$25,000 A POP."
SO TO BE FAIR TO YOU,
IT'S NOT JUST YOU AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS
THAT I DON'T ALTOGETHER TRUST.
LIKE MAYBE SHE BURNED ME A LITTLE BIT.
AND AFTER YOUR WIFE AND I HAD A LITTLE GET TOGETHER IN TOWN--
NOTHING UNTOWARD, BROTHER, NOTHING UNTOWARD--
WELL, I DECIDED WE HAD TO CHECK OUT A FEW THINGS.
SEE, USUALLY WE JUST TAKE THE KID
AND YOU LEAVE THE ISLAND BURNING IN SHAME.
BUT NECESSITY BRINGS US TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME.
AND WHILE WE'RE HERE, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS OTHER THING
BECAUSE THIS IS, AFTER ALL, WHAT WE DO FOR A LIVING.
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
I DON'T THINK I AM, STEVEN.
OKAY, WE WANT TO DO BANK OF AMERICA OR CITIBANK?
BANK OF AMERICA?
OKAY, STEVEN, NOW WE NEED THE PASSCODE,
SO IT'LL ALL GO A LOT EASIER IF YOU JUST GIVE IT TO ME.
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR FUCKING TIME.
ALL RIGHT, NOW I THINK YOU'RE LYING TO ME.
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S LYING TO ME.
BUT I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING, I'M SICK OF BEING LIED TO.
SO LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE STAKES ARE.
THOSE ARE THE STAKES!
- WE'LL BLOW HER FUCKING BRAINS OUT!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- BLOW HER BRAINS OUT NEXT!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- TELL HIM THE FUCKING PASSWORD!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- THE PASSWORD!
SHIT.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
OKAY!
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?
7-1-2 7-3-5.
IS THAT IT?
- HOLD ON, JUST--
- LET GO OF HER.
- LET GO OF HER.
- LET HER GO!
- SHUT THE FUCK UP!
- HEY, HEY, COME ON NOW.
- YOU PIECE OF SHIT.
- SHUT THE FUCK UP, MOTHER FUCKER.
HEY, CALM DOWN.
EVERYBODY TAKE A DEEP BREATH, OKAY?
BABY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO DRUNK THAT NIGHT.
IF I WASN'T AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME GET ME,
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED.
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.
I KNOW I CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST.
- GOD KNOWS I WISH I COULD.
- BABY, THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.
BUT I CAN GET US OUT OF THIS, I PROMISE YOU.
I PROMISE.
GOOD MORNING.
SO, LISTEN...
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM JERRY,
YOUR MAN IN CHICAGO.
UH, WHAT'S HIS NAME, ROSENBERG SOMETHING?
ANYWAY, HE EMAILED,
THE TRANSFER'S GONNA TAKE 48 HOURS.
SO TODAY IS GONNA BE KIND OF A LAY-AROUND DAY,
YOU KNOW, NOTHING TO DO.
LOOK, I'M NOT A MONSTER OR ANYTHING,
AND I'LL BRING YOU SOME FOOD AND WATER.
AND MAYBE YOU CAN EVEN TAKE A SHOWER OR SOMETHING.
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF?
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS THAT?
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF?
YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S ROUGH, SHANNON,
BUT, JUST-- I DO WHAT I CAN.
WHAT HAPPENS TO NINA?
YOU CAN HAVE HER WHEN THIS IS ALL DONE.
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE KID.
IF THINGS GO SMOOTH, THE KID'S YOURS.
HOW DO WE KNOW SHE'S ALIVE?
WELL, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.
LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT, STEVEN.
OKAY?
ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION!
YOU'RE GONNA GET TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTER.
SHE'S IN THAT HOUSE, SHANNON, I KNOW IT.
- THEY'RE GONNA KILL US, NO MATTER WHAT.
- NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE GONNA GET THE MONEY.
THEY'LL GIVE US NINA BACK.
- THEY CAN BLINDFOLD US AND--
- NOBODY EVEN KNOWS THAT WE'RE HERE.
SHANNON, WE ARE GETTING OUT OF THIS.
YOU GO INTO THE BANK.
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING.
NO, BABY, NO.
NO, WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.
IT'S ONLY MONEY.
THEY'RE AFTER THE MONEY.
THEY'LL LET US GO.
SOMEBODY HELP US!
SOMEBODY!
SOMEBODY HELP US!
HELP!
SOMEBODY HELP US!
SOMEBODY!
THEY THINK YOU WANT TO KILL THEM.
NINA SHOWERED, READY FOR BED?
MM-HMM.
YOU WANT ME TO CHECK ON HER?
A LITTLE BIT TO THE LEFT.
LEFT, OVER HERE.
- HERE?
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
ANGIE.
Benjamin, I've got another job for you
- STARTING NEXT WEEK.
- OH, YEAH?
IT'S A WEST COAST COUPLE, SAN FRANCISCO,
ARRIVING SATURDAY.
GREAT.
Listen, Benny, um...
THIS JOB'S NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE WE'RE DOING NOW.
BUT I'M STILL CONFIDENT
WE'LL SEE ABOUT 15 OUT OF IT EACH.
- PRICE IS GOING DOWN?
- Well, just a little.
IT'S STILL WORTH IT.
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE
A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF THEM.
SO, I'LL SEE YOU in a few days with Nina, right?
- OF COURSE.
- Okay.
EVERYTHING OKAY?
Oh, Waldo.
Listen to the happy laughter of those friendly natives.
Then there's the one about the--
ALL RIGHT.
SHOWTIME.
THAT'S TODAY.
OKAY?
IT'S A BIG DAY.
WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE BANK.
WE'LL GET YOU THE MONEY.
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA COOPERATE
AND WE'RE GONNA GET YOU THE MONEY...
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA FORGET ALL ABOUT YOU.
MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.
PLEASE, JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND LET US GO.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I DON'T WANT ANY VIOLENCE.
WE GOOD?
WHEN YOU GET TO THE BANK,
SALO'S GONNA UNCUFF YOU,
THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
HE'S GONNA BE FOLLOWING YOU, BUT NOT LIKE HE KNOWS YOU.
IF YOU DO ANYTHING OR IF YOU TIP ANYBODY OFF,
LAST THING HE DOES BEFORE HE LEAVES THE BANK,
IS SHOOT YOU.
IF HE SHOOTS YOU, THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR MONEY,
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS, WE'RE SHOOTING YOU IN ANGER.
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,
WE DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU OR YOUR WIFE.
SO THAT'S IT, THAT'S THE PLAY.
IT'S UP TO YOU, MAN.
DON'T FUCK UP.
HEY, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE SOON.
YEAH?
AND WE'RE GONNA DO THE SAME THING WE DID BEFORE.
WE'RE GONNA PACK UP AND TRAVEL
AND MAYBE MEET ANOTHER FAMILY AND PLAY THE SAME GAME.OKAY?
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

Tonight, a country brought to its knees.
A 7.2 magnitude earthquake has hit Haiti.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, was literally torn apart.
The earthquake lasted all of a minute.
The intensity so strong, within seconds a cloud of dust covered the city.
And many people are still trapped in the rubble.
Some may still be alive, but getting out alive will be There's truly no way of knowing just how many people are dead.
Bodies are reportedly stacked in streets.
It's feared the number of people killed could now reach 200,000.
200,000 children without a mother or father even before this earthquake.
A country which only seems to know the worst of times is tonight just trying to survive.
- Mama!
Mama!
But it is the human losses which are most shocking.
Mama!
Mama!
"My name is Nina.
I am seven years old."
I can't believe we're finally here.
Are you nervous?
Yeah.
You?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm excited... we got to be close, right?
I hope so.
Hello, hello, I'm Gabrielle.
- Hi.
- Mrs. reigert, nice to meet you finally.
- Steven.
- Shannon.
- Shannon, how are you?
- Excited.
I don't think I've slept in a couple of days.
But we made it and we're here.
Well, let's delay no longer.
Um, actually, I'm gonna tip our driver.
Oh, no, no, that's all taken care of.
The car will wait for you.
Come on.
- Great.
- Okay.
All I need is one more week to secure her passport, but all the Haitian and puerto rican documents are signed and sealed officially.
Excellent.
This is my office.
My assistant maryanne.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Please make yourselves comfortable.
I'll just go and get the little one.
All right.
Nina.
Do you realize when she comes back, we're parents?
It's...
- I'm gonna take a picture.
- Okay, of course you are.
Okay, this way.
Hi.
I'm Shannon.
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
- Merci.
- Bonjour, Nina.
Bonjour.
Do you remember this guy
I showed you on the computer?
Boy, oh boy.
We've been getting to know each other.
Haven't we, ma petite?
I believe congratulations are in order.
Okay, squeeze up.
Smile.
All you have to do now is have fun, relax, get to know Nina.
And if I can, I'll come down on Sunday just to see how she's settling in.
Oh, I don't know that that's necessary.
In fact, you know, maybe it's better
- if we just spend some time...
- no, no.
They get separation anxiety.
Not that I coddled her, but they do form attachments in a very short period of time.
And, uh, the passport?
That should be ready Wednesday the latest.
Well, it's so nice of you to put us up like this.
Oh, it's all part of the service.
In my experience, a nice quiet place by the beach is just the right environment for these children to bond.
To get the sense that everything's okay now,
- if you know what I mean?
I'm gonna...
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
We just became parents.
Look at this.
Wow.
Hey, guys.
Let's walk down and check out the beach.
Great idea.
The guy at the front said it was 83° water.
Is that what they said?
You swim?
You guys going down to the surf?
- Yeah.
- Oh, it's beautiful.
It's beautiful here.
I just got here,
I'm gonna go get my trunks and go in, I think.
- Okay.
- I'm Benjamin.
Hey, Steven Mayer.
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my wife Shannon.
- Hi, Shannon.
Pleasure.
- Hi.
And our daughter Nina.
Hi, Nina.
How are you?
- Where are you guys from?
- Chicago.
Chicago.
Chicago, Illinois.
- Nice.
- Yeah, I was gonna say...
I'm born in Minnesota, but yes, Chicago.
I'm a Chicago girl now.
- Yeah yeah, sure.
- That's where we met... art school.
Oh, art institute of Chicago, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I know it well.
You on vacation or...
Yeah, one of these corporate swag-a-thon things.
You know, a little work, little play.
We're just staying right there though.
It's beautiful.
Beautiful suites.
Oh, we're in that one.
Oh, great, neighbors.
Well, maybe I'll see you around later for a drink or something.
Thank you, that's nice.
I think, um, we're just gonna have an early night tonight and spend some time as a family.
- Yeah.
Great.
All right.
Leave you to it.
- All right, man, see you around.
- Enjoy it.
Have a great day at the beach.
It's nice to meet you, mi...
- it's Nina?
Nina!
- Nina.
- It's our neighbor.
- Yeah.
What's a swag-a-thon?
Yeah.
- Oui.
These I got for you.
I thought they would look good.
Oh, they fit.
Merci.
- She's adorable.
- Mm-hmm.
Um, yeah?
Yeah.
- Oui.
- Oui?
- Yeah?
- Oui.
She says, "get over here."
- Okay.
- Papa should get over here.
- All right.That's our house.
Our house.
And that's your room.
It's yellow, what's yellow?
Jaune.
- The water nice?
- Yes, feel.
You said you were gonna get in.
I will, I will.
This is... she's so adorable.
We know what we're doing, right?
Whatever we don't know we'll figure out.
Stupid people have kids every day.
It works out, right?
Right?
Right?
Tragic, but true.
And we're not stupid, so...
To not being stupid.
I'm sorry if I...
it's Steve?
- Hey.
- Steven?
Steven and Shannon.
- Veronica and salo.
- Hi.
Hey.
Hope we didn't keep you up last night.
We were a little over-served.
We were a little loud.
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.
All good.
- Okay.
See you later.
Bye.
Jeez, is he going north later?
Nina.
Nina!
I want to see if you can do this, okay?
You know what a...
you know what a cartwheel is?
Cartwheel?
I took high school French.
I don't know.
You like that?
Watch this one, watch.
Keep practicing.
Yes, yes.
Your crazy daddy.
Here.
And... voila!
You want to decorate it?
That's a good idea.
That is perfect.
Hey.
Nina, regard.
Over there, across the ocean that's where our house is.
La Maison?
- Mm-hmm.
Soon as we get your passport, we'll go there.
Nina!
That looked so good I had to join you.
Nothing like a cool drink on a hot day, cheers.
Cheers.
Yeah, they do a good virgin Mary if you like those.
- Not bad.
- You... you don't drink?
No.
Need a little hair of the dog, you know?
I just needed a minute from the sun.
She's really beautiful, Nina.
You must be really excited.
Yeah, we're insanely lucky.
She's, um... she's adopted I take it, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Where from?
- From Haiti.
- Haiti.
Why Haiti?
Do you know?
I mean, do you have any... we didn't really specify.
It was more just...
Do something good for someone in need.
And anyplace where it's bad, it's even worse for children.
I was in Haiti.
I know how bad it is there.
You were in Haiti?
Yeah, working with an n.G.O.
Terrible there.
Anyway, the reason I asked you is because I admire you.
Thank you.
You know, because I was adopted.
I was a foster kid.
You know, it's tough.
- Oh, I was adopted.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Wow, cheers.
The world's a lot better place for you and your husband doing it.
Thank you, that's nice.
What's your tat?
It's a poem.
Let me see your hand there.
- "Invictus." - "Invictus."
Look at that life line.
Nina, looks good.
- C'est bon.
- C'est bon.
You've reached International Rescue Adoptions.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey, Mrs. reigert, it's, uh, Steven Mayer.
Um, we had a great couple days at the resort, but we decided to move to the Caribbean Hotel.
It's closer to Old San Juan, and there's more stuff for kids to do here, so... hi, Steven.
Oh, hey...
hey, Gabrielle.
Um, yeah, the neighbors were a little loud last night, so we kind of decided we'd move.
Oh, that's not good, keep you awake.
No, no, no.
It's fine, and we appreciated being there.
It's just, um...
The Caribbean Hotel, you said?
Yeah.
I know it well.
It's beautiful.
You're gonna love it there.
Hey, any word on the passport?
Oh, still Monday or Tuesday or even Wednesday I'm afraid.
It'll come by registered post.
How's Nina?
She's just, uh...
She's great.
We're all very, very happy.
Feels like she's been with us forever.
Good, good.
Well, you have a great time.
Enjoy yourselves.
Okay, catch up Monday.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
She picked the pink one.
- I think I did all right.
- I like it.
I did good, right?
Want to see?
Tu veux voir?
Yes!
I should take...
You're asleep already?
I'm so tired.
Like mother, like daughter.
Baby, I'm kind of wired.
I think I'm gonna take a walk.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'll be back.
Love you.
Love you too.
And here's the weather for Chicago...
Baby, it was only a few drinks.
It's always only two drinks.
- Steven, come on.
- What?
All right, just...
let me give her a kiss, okay?
- Okay.
- And you have the best mommy in the world.
That's true, but... but mommy's trying to get us home.
And you've had too much to drink, so...
Low of 46, on Sunday, partly sunny...
Shannon!
Hey.
- You guys are everywhere.
- Hi.
- What are you drinking?
- This guy here.
- Grab a table, salo.
- Good to see you again.
What do you want, man?
What are you drinking?
- I think I'm on my way out.
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm buying, so...
- Um...
- ...
Might as well have one.
A near beer.
- Non-alcoholic?
- Yeah.
Uh, four, one... no alcohol?
Not tonight.
Are you guys from here, the island?
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.
- Locals.
- Beautiful place to live.
Not as good as America though, right?
I wouldn't say that.
It's amazing here.
- It's fucking amazing here, right?
- Yeah, I love it.
I like puerto rican Chinese girls.
Here you go.
Go easy on that one there.
Yeah, I don't drink much anymore, but I still like the taste of beer, so...
I don't know, man.
I...
I quit for a while, and then I realized I really wanted...
Alcohol.
- Cheers.
- Salud.
Cheers.
Steven here is on a mission of mercy.
- A mission?
- Well...
He adopts needy kids from Dante's inferno and whisks them back to America.
We're adopting one.
The little girl you saw us on the beach with, she's a Haitian refugee.
And we're adopting her.
- Oh, that's lovely.
- Isn't it?
Did you ever spend any time down there?
Like... no, not that region.
You?
Yeah, I spent some time down there.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I was doing like a... working with security for this place called P.N.C.
Guards medical supplies.
And it was kind of a...
- after the earthquake?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Anyway, here's to you.
It's a great thing what you're doing, man.
- Cheers.
- Appreciate it.
All right, guys, I told Shannon
I'd be five minutes, so I'm gonna head out.
- You can't go now, man.
- Why can't I?
You can't walk out on your round.
It's basic puerto rican manners.
We get you a round, you get us a round.
You owe us a round.
See, we got you the first round.
Now, you get us the second round.
I understand, okay.
I can...
I can do that.
Salo's got a lot of rules.
That's not a rule.
Come on, man.
- Can I get another round of what he ordered?
- Four-and-four.
Exactly.
There's etiquettes everywhere.
Is it expensive?
- What's that?
- Well, the whole process.
You know, cutting through all the red tape.
Um, I suppose if one does, but we went a more straightforward route.
No, I mean, is it hard... like, do you have to need an expeditor or do they bilk you for more and more money or anything?
I mean, you know, I...
I can't speak to that.
The waiting is difficult.
You know, but...
- There it is.
- You guys having another?
Yeah.
Here, brother.
You got to drink that.
Um, let's see.
Um, this should cover
both rounds.
You guys have a great evening.
All right, bud.
- Is that for me, dude?
- We're not good enough for you?
- Shannon, it's not what you think.
- Have you lost your mind?
I didn't do anything, I promise.
I didn't know where you were.
You call me from a police station in the middle of the night.
They wouldn't let me just walk out of here on my own.
I had no choice.
It's the way they do things here.
Have you been drinking?
No, the guy dumped beer on me.
It was the weird people from the cabin that we keep running into.
They just twisted the story all around.
Sir.
Sign here, will you please?
Is this really happening?
Are we really back here?
I didn't do...
Nina, um...
Oui.
Nina, I'm sorry mommy had to wake you up in the middle of the night.
I hope you can forgive me.
Yeah?
Hello.
Heard it was the wild, wild west out there, huh?
It was, um, a misunderstanding.
Yeah, you had a run-in with some troublemakers, I understand?
Yes, actually, I did.
I was attacked for no reason.
I tried to explain that to your officers.
Yeah, well, a nice family like you shouldn't have to deal with that type of nonsense.
Life shouldn't have to be that complicated.
That's my card if you need anything.
And who might this littleflorecita be?
It's our daughter, Nina.
Lovely.
Well, look, we really love tourists here, so please enjoy yourselves.
Do yourself a favor...
stay out of bars for awhile, okay?
Yes, sir.
You up?
Yeah.
Baby, I'm sorry about last night.
It won't happen again.
Do you know what I...
What I really think would make everything better?
What?
Pancakes.
Okay.
- That's easy.
- I'm the world's cheapest date.
You order pancakes, I'll see if Nina's awake.
Okay.
Nina, honey.
Nina, honey.
Steven!
She's not up here!
What?
What do you mean she's not here?
Nina!
Honey?
Nina.
Nina!
Her shoes are gone!
The door was locked.
She's not here.
- Nina!
- Nina!
Nina!
- I'll ask reception.
- Okay.
- Nina!
- Nina!
Hi.
I'm looking for my daughter.
She was in her room.
She's been missing...
I don't know for how long.
- Nina!
- She's seven years old, she's about this tall.
- Excuse me, sir, can I help you?
Yeah, our daughter's missing.
Okay, how old is she?
Uh, she's seven, she's Haitian.
Maybe you saw her come through the lobby?
I'm sorry.
- She was wearing...
- she was wearing, uh, pink pajama pants
- with polka dots and a blue t-shirt.
- Okay, calm down, calm down.
You know, the little ones, they go where they want and suddenly they turn up, so...
- Oh my god, Steven!
- ...
Not to worry.
- Sir?
Sir?
- The pool!
- She's in the pool!
- Sir?
This isn't happening.
Someone on your staff had to see her.
Mr. Mayer, there's certain protocol that we follow here, and we're doing that.
Getting angry with the staff?
It's not gonna help.
- What about security footage?
- We're looking into that.
She can't have just disappeared.
Children do wander off.
What?
A seven-year-old with a complex past, brand new set of circumstances, bewildered, overwhelmed.
We're looking intoevery possibility.
And considering the conflict the other night, we have to investigate that.
Can you make a list of other places you've been since you arrived and the people that you met?
And also, do you have any photos of Nina?
I'll get my computer.
If she did wander off alone, she's probably out there hungry by now.
Someone has to notice a little girl alone.
What about the adoption agency?
- How well did they know her?
- We've been calling them.
We're waiting for Nina's passport to come through.
They didn't answer yesterday.
I'm trying to bring up her profile picture on the website, but...
There's no website.
How much did you pay for this adoption?
Uh... $60,000.
Excuse me.
We'll be in touch.
I'm sorry.
We've been parents for 48 hours.
She couldn't have walked out on us, could she?
What do you mean?
I mean, she couldn't have wanted to, right?
She seemed so happy.
All I ever wanted to be was a mother.
Pretend with my little sister,
I'd... bathe her and feed her and tuck her in at night.
I swore that when I had kids of my own
I would never abandon them the way that my birth mother... mother abandoned me.
So we have to find her, okay?
We will, okay?
We will.
I just...
because... because I don't know what to do, Steven, and I don't know where she is.
I'm going back to that office.
You think that that's a good idea?
No one's answering the phone, the website's down.
I'm gonna go confront her directly.
Maybe we should just let the cops handle that.
The cops don't care, Shannon.
We're tourists.
They got enough problems of their own.
- Just... just keep looking.
- Okay, go.
I'll keep looking, okay.
What the fuck?
Nina?
Perdon.
- Yeah.
- Mrs. Mayer.
- You had some new info?
Well, we contacted the consulate and your paperwork was never processed.
No Gabrielle reigert or Nina duvalier.
That has to be a mistake.
Let me guess.
She told you she would contact you when your passport came in, so all Nina had to do was wander off at the appointed time into her waiting arms.
No, um...
No, our room was locked.
We would've heard the door open.
The scam is called reclaiming.
And, unfortunately, it's not rare.
What they do, they get as much money as they can, take the kid back, on to the next victim.
New web site, new city, new country.
- It's very hard to track.
It's all over Asia now.
- This website had, um... it had all these, uh, links, and it had testimonials.
Well, websites will do that.
Where's your husband?
Sir, sir...
No, no.
Uh, just keep that.
Thank you.
I don't know exactly.
He's out looking for her.
Yeah, we heard about a break-in in old San Juan.
I don't know anything about that.
We don't need vigilantes.
We're gonna find the girl.
Comandante, this, um... this scam that you're talking about...
It might be true...
But it also might not be.
- So you have to keep looking for her.
- We will keep looking.
- You have to find her.
- We will.
Sorry, have you seen this little girl?
Sorry, I'm just looking for this little girl.
Esta niña.
Um, have you seen her?
Esta niña.
Can you... no, you haven't seen her?
This little girl, have you seen her?
I did a really stupid thing, Shannon.
We did a stupid thing.
No, I did.
You looked so happy.
We just finished painting her room.
Everything was set.
And then I get an email out of nowhere saying the whole thing fell apart.
What are you talking about?
She said she could make it go away.
She... she said no one would know...
So I paid her.
We'd already paid.
I paid her more to make it work.
How much more?
Another 30.
Fuck.
Fuck, Steven.
Steven, you're telling me you bought our daughter on the black market.
No, no.
No.
She was an official expeditor, Shannon.
She had...
you saw her credentials, and that office.
Baby, we were so close.
What was I supposed to do?
What about run it by me?
Communicate?
I wanted everything to work out.
And so what?
You decided that you would just take shortcuts as usual?
We were on a waiting list back home, remember?
Another two to three more years.
I was fine to wait.
Oh, sure, you were fine to wait.
If you already paid her, why didn't she just not show up?
Fuck.
What?
There were...
Additional fees...
This week.
The money came through yesterday.
- I guess she was waiting...
- Are you fucking serious?
...and the passport story was there to just string us along.
More than the 30?
Not as much...
another 10.
We're never gonna see her again.
Maybe she was never ours.
- Maybe none of this was real.
- It was real.
You felt it too, didn't you?
Yeah, I thought I did.
But... is she...
Does she even belong to us, legally?
If this is a scam, if they're criminals,
- do we even stick around?
- She's a little girl.
She's out there somewhere with god knows what kinds of people.
She was supposed to be our daughter.
Doesn't that mean we're supposed to try?
Of course it does.
Yes.
Let's...
let's drive around some more.
I just...
I need some time, okay?
You drive around.
Shit.
- Hey, Shannon.
- Shannon?
It's Benjamin and Veronica.
- I just wanted to say we're really sorry...
- I know that.
...for what happened the other night.
It was just a misunderstanding,
I know Steven didn't pick a fight with you.
He's so passive, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
He didn't pick a fight with me, it was my buddy salo, anyway.
We just didn't know that he didn't drink.
Look, my daughter's missing, so I don't... can we just not?
You're daughter's missing?
Where is she?
Yeah, it's all...
it's all part of some scam.
A scam?
Yeah, these people, they just... they, um...
They give you a little girl, they get a 100 grand from you...
And then they take her back.
100 grand?
Oh my god.
Well, what are you gonna do?
- Did you talk to the police?
- Yeah, I called the cops.
- What did they say?
I mean, what's the next step?
- Will you excuse me?
How do you not tell me about something that big...
Shannon, I knew if I told you about the money you would've just... if you told me about the money,
I would've said it was a bad idea.
Yeah, okay, well, I thought I was making a good decision for us.
This isn't about doing something good.
It's about your complete lack of judgment.
Thanks.
A marriage is a partnership, okay?
You never talk to me!
We are still gonna talk about this.
I know where she is.
- I'm calling the police.
- Wait.
Benjamin has her.
- What are you talking about?
- I can take you to her.
Why should we trust you?
We don't have another option.
Is she okay?
She's fine.
She's just scared.
- Why are you helping us?
- Yeah.
Because I don't want to be a part of it.
Say a fucking word I'm gonna blow your head off, okay?
Go to the wall.
Put your hands up on the wall.
Against the wall now!
Hands down.
Shh.
Put your hands behind your back.
Get the tape.
Be quiet.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right, stay there.
Wallet?
All right.
Hotel room key.
Check them out, you drive their rental car.
See you there.
Let's move.
Feet up.
Welcome to your puerto rican vacations, motherfuckers.
Get the fuck out!
Hurry up!
Move.
Move.
Move, you fucking gringo.
Move, you motherfucker!
Sit down.
Sit the fuck down!
Sit the fuck down!
Motherfucker, I will shoot your fucking brains out.
What did you do with Nina?
She's fine, really.
Nina's fine, no problem.
Please, just tell us what you want.
All in good time.
So you got somebody in Chicago that looks after your money?
- Our money?
- Yeah.
Shannon, you come from money.
And you have a big fucking pile of it.
Even before the accident, right?
There's nothing left.
Really?
$2.9 million settlement?
Think I'm a fucking moron?
August 12th, 2010, "Chicago Sun Times,"
"Chicago woman receives civilL settlement in city tragedy.
lLate afternoon.
It was ruled that the Cooke county department of public works was at fault when a waste disposal truck collided with Shannon Mayer, 27, of oak park..."
Please, stop it.
- "...claiming the life of her unborn daughter."
- That's enough!
- And you lost the ability to bear more children.
All right, so you have money.
What did you do with it?
I mean, you don't strike me as the extravagant type.
We... we bought a house.
We, um... we rebuilt a life.
We started a charitable trust.
- We adopted Nina.
- You know what you did?
You invested.
- Right?
- He's a toy designer.
We don't really make that much, and I haven't worked since the accident.
What kind of fucking toys do you make?
All right, you didn't work after the accident?
I'm telling you, man, there's nothing there.
Steven...
You're supposed to be a smart guy.
I know all about you.
All right, we have something in common here.
You know this woman, Gabrielle reigert?
That's not her real name.
Her real name is Angie.
So this funny, little woman comes up to me in some shit-hole, business-class airport lounge and says, "come do this thing."
"Who is this woman?" I'm thinking.
"What is she, fucking intel?
What is she, Blackwater?
Christian outreach?"
I don't give a fuck.
She says, "I pay cash.
$25,000 a pop."
So to be fair to you, it's not just you and your bank accounts that I don't altogether trust.
Like maybe she burned me a little bit.
And after your wife and I had a little get together in town... nothing untoward, brother, nothing untoward... well, I decided we had to check out a few things.
See, usually we just take the kid and you leave the island burning in shame.
But necessity brings us together one more time.
And while we're here, you know, we're gonna do this other thing because this is, after all, what we do for a living.
- You're wasting your time.
I don't think I am, Steven.
Okay, we want to do bank of America or citibank?
Bank of America?
Okay, Steven, now we need the passcode, so it'll all go a lot easier if you just give it to me.
I'm telling you, you are wasting your fucking time.
All right, now I think you're lying to me.
And I don't think you're the only one who's lying to me.
But I'm telling you something, I'm sick of being lied to.
So let's be really clear about what the stakes are.
Those are the stakes!
- We'll blow her fucking brains out!
- Leave her alone!
- Blow her brains out next!
- Leave her alone!
- Tell him the fucking password!
- Leave her alone!
- The password!
Shit.
All right, okay, all right, all right!
Okay!
All right.
What is it?
7-1-2 7-3-5.
Is that it?
- Hold on, just...
- let go of her.
- Let go of her.
- Let her go!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, hey, come on now.
- You piece of shit.
- Shut the fuck up, mother fucker.
Hey, calm down.
Everybody take a deep breath, okay?
Baby, I shouldn't have been so drunk that night.
If I wasn't and you didn't have to come get me, none of this would have ever happened.
We wouldn't be here.
I know I can't change the past.
- God knows I wish I could.
- Baby, this is not your fault.
But I can get us out of this, I promise you.
I promise.
Good morning.
So, listen...
I got an email from Jerry, your man in Chicago.
Uh, what's his name, Rosenberg something?
Anyway, he emailed, the transfer's gonna take 48 hours.
So today is gonna be kind of a lay-around day, you know, nothing to do.
Look, I'm not a monster or anything, and I'll bring you some food and water.
And maybe you can even take a shower or something.
How do you live with yourself?
I'm sorry.
What was that?
How do you live with yourself?
Yeah, you know, it's rough, Shannon, but, just...
I do what I can.
What happens to Nina?
You can have her when this is all done.
I don't give a fuck about the kid.
If things go smooth, the kid's yours.
How do we know she's alive?
Well, that's a fair question.
Let me get back to you on that, Steven.
Okay?
Answer the fucking question!
You're gonna get to see your daughter.
She's in that house, Shannon, I know it.
- They're gonna kill us, no matter what.
- No, no, no.
We're gonna get the money.
They'll give us Nina back.
- They can blindfold us and...
- nobody even knows that we're here.
Shannon, we are getting out of this.
You go into the bank.
You have to tell them everything.
No, baby, no.
No, we have to give them what they want.
It's only money.
They're after the money.
They'll let us go.
Somebody help us!
Somebody!
Somebody help us!
Help!
Somebody help us!
Somebody!
They think you want to kill them.
Nina showered, ready for bed?
Mm-hmm.
You want me to check on her?
A little bit to the left.
Left, over here.
- Here?
- Yeah.
All right.
Angie.
Benjamin, I've got another job for you
- starting next week.
- Oh, yeah?
It's a west coast couple, San Francisco, arriving Saturday.
Great.
Listen, Benny, um...
This job's not as good as the one we're doing now.
But I'm still confident we'll see about 15 out of it each.
- Price is going down?
- Well, just a little.
It's still worth it.
I might be able to squeeze a little bit more out of them.
So, I'll see you in a few days with Nina, right?
- Of course.
- Okay.
Everything okay?
Oh, Waldo.
Listen to the happy laughter of those friendly natives.
Then there's the one about the... all right.
Showtime.
That's today.
Okay?
It's a big day.
We're gonna go to the bank.
We'll get you the money.
Okay, we're gonna cooperate and we're gonna get you the money...
And then we're gonna forget all about you.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Please, just take the money and let us go.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
I don't want any violence.
We good?
When you get to the bank, salo's gonna uncuff you, then you're on your own.
He's gonna be following you, but not like he knows you.
If you do anything or if you tip anybody off, last thing he does before he leaves the bank, is shoot you.
If he shoots you, that means we're not getting our money, which basically means, we're shooting you in anger.
It goes without saying, we don't want to shoot you or your wife.
So that's it, that's the play.
It's up to you, man.
Don't fuck up.
Hey, we're gonna leave soon.
Yeah?
And we're gonna do the same thing we did before.
We're gonna pack up and travel and maybe meet another family and play the same game.
Okay?
You're doing great.
Hi, my name's Steven Mayer.
Mr. Lopez is expecting me.
Oh, yes, Mr. Mayer, the transfer, right?
Yes.
Please, let me check your documents.
It's a long drive out here.
We're staying in...
is it "monaba"?
- Maunabo.
- Maunabo.
There's a big tunnel out there, yeah?
Oh, yes.
Let me get Mr. Lopez for you.
Okay.
Alfonso Lopez, how do you do?
Uh, Steven Mayer, thank you so much for getting this done.
Unusual transaction.
Sometimes in Puerto Rico we have problems with money laundering.
Oh, we're, uh...
we're buying land here, actually.
It cost $600,000, but they said they would knock off $100,000 if we paid cash, so... excuse me.
Enjoy your property.
Thank you.
Give me the money bag.
Not until I have Nina and my wife.
This isn't time to fuck with me, okay?
Hey!
I need to get to maunabo.
Quickly please, por favor.
We good?
We got a problem.
What kind of problem?
I lost him.
We got out of the bank, he just took off with the fucking money.
Stay there.
Pack up, laptops, everything.
Meet me at Angie's in 15 minutes.
Okay.
Can I use your phone?
It's an emergency.
It's Steven Mayer.
I'm on my way to Maunabo.
Shannon's there in a shed somewhere and Nina's there.
Benjamin kidnapped us.
Okay, Steve, I need you to slow down.
- Tell me where you are.
- I'm in a cab.
Okay, so the place... it's about a mile after you come out of the maunabo tunnel.
Um, you'll see a boat in a tree.
Okay, look, this is what I need you to do, okay?
I need you to take that cab to the station.
We're on our way to maunabo.
And as soon as we find your family,
I will call you, okay?
There won't be enough time.
- You got him?
- What?
- Do you have him?
- No.
Keep looking.
Boy, oh, boy.
Nina, stay in your room!
All right, it's gonna be a left up here.
You'll see...
you'll see a boat in a tree.
He's here.
Load the shotgun, take the safety off.
When he gets out of the car, put him on the ground.
Wait here a minute.
I'll be right out.
- We're going back to San Juan?
- Yeah.
Lie down, drop the bag.
Salo, you piece of shit, you lost him.
He's coming back here now.
The police will be here any second.
You still have time to go.
I said drop the fucking bag.
They're gonna arrest you.
Get the fuck out of here!
Go!
Get out of here!
I said drop it!
Benjamin is on his way back.
What's he paying you?
Whatever it is, I'll double it.
- I have money right here.
Look, I'll show you.
- Hey!
Turn around!
Turn around now!
Let's go!
Get in the house!
Shannon, come on, let's go!
Nina!
Come on.
Good girl.
Come on.
- Is she okay?
- She's good, she's good.
Come on, in you go.
Come on.
Okay, drive.
Go, go, go.
Shit.
He's turning around.
He's coming.
- Steven!
It's okay.
Get down!
Baby, you okay?
Nobody move, nobody move.
Stay still, Shannon.
I'm gonna get out and come to that window, okay?
Okay.
Shit.
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah.
Okay, Nina, you're gonna come with me.
You're gonna come with me.
Hang on to me, Nina.
Shannon, grab me.
Grab me, grab me.
Grab me, Shannon.
Shannon.
Baby?
- What?
- You got to let me go.
You're gonna need both hands.
Steven, you've got to let me go.
Baby.
You've got to save Nina!
- All right, grab onto something, honey, grab on!
- I got it.
I got it.
Okay, I got it.
Come on, it's okay.
Come on.
Just look at me.
Stay here, all right?
All right, Shannon, give me your hands.
Shannon, hang on!
Hang on!
Hang on!
Steven!
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Grab the strap!
- I can't.
You got to do it.
- Grab the strap.
- I can't!
Come on, you got to do it, just grab it.
Mama, mama!
Where's Benjamin?
His car's down there.
I think he's dead.
- Anybody else here?
- The girlfriend might still be at the house.
If you send someone, maybe you can catch her.
You okay, little one?
You okay?
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Please, to the car.
- What's in the bag?
- Uh...
Lot of cash.
- Go.
- Sir.
Hey, uh...
I would like to apologize for not believing you guys about those two.
It's fine.
It's not necessary.
Thank you.
Well, you're safe now.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I got you.
You guys okay?
It's okay.
Yeah, you?
Don't fucking move!
- Okay, okay.
- Don't fucking move!
Do not move!
- We're gonna go for a little walk.
- Shannon, just stay calm.
- No, no, no, no.
Just take the money.
- Stay calm.
Steven!
- You son of a bitch!
- What?
- Just take the money!
- Oh, I'm gonna take the money.
Steven!
Steven!
Not much time.
Help!
Go home, Nina.
Steven!
Hey, you want this?
- Go on up.
- All right.
- Home sweet home, Nina.
- Ben?
- What the fuck, Ben?
- What kind of woman uses children?
- Fuck off!
- Sit the fuck down.
What the fuck, Ben?
Big day, Angie.
- Change of plans.
- Where's the husband?
Oh, he's in the trunk... trunk of the car out there.
We got a cop car.
We got two cars I got to get rid of.
Dead bodies, cops.
I don't know where Veronica is.
Salo's dead.
These are not my problems, Ben.
What's mine is yours, Angie.
All I'm saying is, we should be discreet.
Uh-huh.
An opportunity arose and I had to act fast.
- An opportunity?
- They had more money.
So, you got more money.
That's great.
Like I said, it's been a big day.
Of course.
Shannon, this is Angie.
Angie, Shannon.
Angie is sort of the mastermind of this whole thing.
She organizes everything and she seduces the young couples like you who don't want the, you know, fresh new puppies from the pet shop.
You'll take the older ones 'cause you got a conscience.
Nina, sweetie, will you go play in your room?
The adults have to talk.
Go on, baby.
Like I said, it's been a big day.
Ben, I think we should do what needs to be done.
We'll do it together.
We're partners, after all.
I'll help you... cars, bodies.
- Yeah?
- Okay.
Okay.
You got my cut?
Of course I got your cut.
How much?
The usual.
25.
50% of 50 grand.
How much you pay, Shannon?
Ben, there is a lot more money coming in.
You're gonna get a lot more money, sweetheart.
Every little bit counts, right?
I'm gonna give you more...
- No!
- Nina!
Go back to your room.
Go back to your room.
Nina!
- What happened, bitch?
- You hurt your ankle?
Fuck you.
You don't have to do this.
You can have the money.
You can have whatever you want.
We're good people.
I know you're good people.
I mean, I know the difference.
You know?
You would have been really good for Nina.
Yeah, we would have been.
Yeah, we would have been.
We would have taken really good care of her.
Please.
Please, please don't kill me.
Put it down!
Put the gun down!
Or what, Steven, you gonna shoot me in the back?
- Yes, I will.
- We both know you're not gonna do that.
- Man, I swear to god I'll do it.
- Yeah?
Your wife's got more balls than you
- and she's unarmed.
- Don't fucking test me!
Put the gun down!
I've seen the way you look at him.
I know.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- Oh my god.
- It's okay now.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
- Nina.
- Nina.
Nina, no, no, no.
Put... put the gun down on the ground.
We're not gonna hurt you.
We want to take care of you.
Nina.
Nina.
- It's okay now, sweetheart.
- It's okay.
We want to take care of you, Nina, but you have to put the gun down.
We want to take you home.
Okay?
And you'll have your own room... your yellow room, Nina.
You want to come with us?
Great job.
Good girl.
Hey...
You all right?
You don't have to do this anymore, okay?
We're gonna take care of you.
Come on.
You're okay.
It's okay.
Good girl.
A little girl and she can't speak can't find the words out from the crowd
she'll never hear the cries of those who call her name above the clouds she's just a girl with her heart in her hand
and she'll never make it on her own
she's fighting the world
she's fighting the world oh, she's fighting the world
she's fighting the world a little girl and she can't see
who is right and who deceives
never known another life never had someone she could believe
but did she ever have a chance on her own?
Caught on the outside looking in she's fighting the world
she's fighting the world she's fighting the world she's fighting the world but now she can see the light
now she can hear the sound a chance of another life
- and love - and love to be found
she's fighting the world.
Tonight, a country brought to its knees.
A 7.2 magnitude earthquake has hit Haiti.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, was literally torn apart.
The earthquake lasted all of a minute.
The intensity so strong, within seconds a cloud of dust covered the city.
And many people are still trapped in the rubble.
Some may still be alive, but getting out alive will be a very desperate effort.
There's truly no way of knowing just how many people are dead.
Bodies are reportedly stacked in streets.
It's feared the number of people killed could now reach 200,000.
200,000 children without a mother or father even before this earthquake.
A country which only seems to know the worst of times
- is tonight just trying to survive.
- Mama!
Mama!
But it is the human losses which are most shocking.
Mama!
Mama!
"My name is Nina.
I am seven years old."
I can't believe we're finally here.
Are you nervous?
Yeah.
You?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm excited.
We got to be close, right?
I hope so.
- Hello, hello, I'm Gabrielle.
- Hi.
Mrs. Reigert, nice to meet you finally.
- Steven.
- Shannon.
- Shannon, how are you?
- Excited.
I don't think I've slept in a couple of days.
But we made it and we're here.
Well, let's delay no longer.
Um, actually, I'm gonna tip our driver.
Oh, no, no, that's all taken care of.
The car will wait for you.
Come on.
- Great.
- Okay.
AII I need is one more week to secure her passport, but all the Haitian and Puerto Rican documents
- are signed and sealed officially.
- Excellent.
This is my office.
My assistant Maryanne.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Please make yourselves comfortable.
I'll just go and get the little one.
All right.
Nina.
Do you realize when she comes back, we're parents?
It's...
- I'm gonna take a picture.
- Okay, of course you are.
Okay, this way.
Hi.
I'm Shannon.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
- Merci.
- Bonjour, Nina.
Bonjour.
Do you remember this guy
I showed you on the computer?
Boy, oh boy.
We've been getting to know each other.
Haven't we, ma petite?
I believe congratulations are in order.
Okay, squeeze up.
Smile.
All you have to do now is have fun, relax, get to know Nina.
And if I can, I'll come down on Sunday just to see how she's settling in.
Oh, I don't know that that's necessary.
In fact, you know, maybe it's better
- if we just spend some time...
- No, no.
They get separation anxiety.
Not that I coddled her, but they do form attachments in a very short period of time.
And, uh, the passport?
That should be ready Wednesday the latest.
Well, it's so nice of you to put us up like this.
Oh, it's all part of the service.
In my experience, a nice quiet place by the beach is just the right environment for these children to bond.
To get the sense that everything's okay now, if you know what I mean?
I'm gonna...
Thank you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
We just became parents.
Look at this.
Wow.
Hey, guys.
Let's walk down and check out the beach.
Great idea.
The guy at the front said it was 83¨¬ water.
- Is that what they said?
- You swim?
You guys going down to the surf?
- Yeah.
- Oh, it's beautiful.
It's beautiful here.
I just got here,
I'm gonna go get my trunks and go in, I think.
- Okay.
- I'm Benjamin.
Hey, Steven Mayer.
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my wife Shannon.
- Hi, Shannon.
Pleasure.
- Hi.
And our daughter Nina.
Hi, Nina.
How are you?
- Where are you guys from?
- Chicago.
Chicago.
Chicago, Illinois.
Nice.
Yeah, I was gonna say...
I'm born in Minnesota, but yes, Chicago.
I'm a Chicago girl now.
- Yeah yeah, sure.
- That's where we met... art school.
Oh, Art Institute of Chicago, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I know it well.
You on vacation or...?
Yeah, one of these corporate swag-a-thon things.
You know, a little work, little play.
We're just staying right there though.
It's beautiful.
Beautiful suites.
Oh, we're in that one.
Oh, great, neighbors.
Well, maybe I'll see you around later for a drink or something.
Thank you, that's nice.
I think, um, we're just gonna have an early night tonight
- and spend some time as a family.
- Yeah.
Great.
All right.
Leave you to it.
- All right, see you around.
- Enjoy it.
Have a great day at the beach.
It's nice to meet you, Mi...
- it's Nina?
Nina!
- Nina.
- It's our neighbor.
- Yeah.
- What's a swag-a-thon?
- Yeah.
Oui.
These I got for you.
I thought they would look good.
Oh, they fit.
Merci.
- She's adorable.
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Oui.
- Oui?
- Yeah?
- Oui.
- She says, "Get over here. "
- Okay.
- Papa should get over here.
- All right.
That's our house.
Our house.
And that's your room.
It's yellow.
What's yellow?
Jaune.
- The water nice?
- Yes, feel.
You said you were gonna get in.
I will, I will.
This is...
She's so adorable.
We know what we're doing, right?
Whatever we don't know we'll figure out.
Stupid people have kids every day.
It works out, right?
- Right?
Right?
Tragic, but true.
And we're not stupid, so...
To not being stupid.
- I love you.
- I'm sorry if I... it's Steve?
- Hey.
- Steven?
Steven and Shannon.
- Veronica and Salo.
- Hi.
Hey.
Hope we didn't keep you up last night.
We were a little over-served.
- We were a little loud.
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.
- All good.
- Okay.
See you later.
Bye.
Jeez, is he going north later?
Nina.
Nina!
I want to see if you can do this, okay?
You know what a...
you know what a cartwheel is?
- Cartwheel?
- I took high school French.
I don't know.
You like that?
Watch this one, watch.
Keep practicing.
Yes, yes.
Your crazy daddy.
Here.
And... voila!
You want to decorate it?
That's a good idea.
That is perfect.
Hey.
Nina, regard.
Over there, across the ocean... that's where our house is.
- La maison?
- Mm-hmm.
Soon as we get your passport, we'll go there.
Nina!
That looked so good, I had to join you.
Nothing like a cool drink on a hot day.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Yeah, they do a good Virgin Mary if you like those.
- Not bad.
- You... you don't drink?
No.
Need a little hair of the dog, you know?
I just needed a minute from the sun.
She's really beautiful, Nina.
You must be really excited.
Yeah, we're insanely lucky.
She's, um... she's adopted I take it, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Where from?
- From Haiti.
- Haiti.
Why Haiti?
Do you know?
I mean, do you have any...
We didn't really specify.
It was more just... do something good for someone in need.
And anyplace where it's bad, it's even worse for children.
I was in Haiti.
I know how bad it is there.
You were in Haiti?
Yeah, working with an NGO.
Terrible there.
Anyway, the reason I asked you is because I admire you.
- Thank you.
- You know, because I was adopted.
I was a foster kid.
You know, it's tough.
- Oh, I was adopted.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Wow, cheers.
The world's a lot better place for you and your husband doing it.
Thank you, that's nice.
What's your tat?
It's a poem.
Let me see your hand there.
- "Invictus." - "Invictus."
Look at that life line.
Nina, looks good.
- C'est bon.
- C'est bon.
You've reached International Rescue Adoptions.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey, Mrs. Reigert, it's, uh, Steven Mayer.
Um, we had a great couple days at the resort, but we decided to move to the Caribbean Hotel.
It's closer to Old San Juan, and there's more stuff for kids to do here, so...
Hi, Steven.
Oh, hey... hey, Gabrielle.
Um, yeah, the neighbors were a little loud last night, so we kind of decided we'd move.
Oh, that's not good, keep you awake.
No, no, no.
It's fine, and we appreciated being there.
It's just, um...
The Caribbean Hotel, you said?
- Yeah.
- I know it well.
It's beautiful.
You're gonna love it there.
Hey, any word on the passport?
Oh, still Monday or Tuesday or even Wednesday I'm afraid.
It'll come by registered post.
How's Nina?
She's just, uh... she's great.
We're all very, very happy.
Feels like she's been with us forever.
Good, good.
Well, you have a great time.
Enjoy yourselves.
Okay, catch up Monday.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
She picked the pink one.
- I think I did all right.
- I like it.
I did good, right?
Want to see?
Tu veux voir?
Yes!
I should take a picture.
So pretty.
Yes.
You're asleep already?
I'm so tired.
Like mother, like daughter.
Baby, I'm kind of wired.
I think I'm gonna take a walk.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'll be back.
Love you.
Love you too.
And here's the weather for Chicago...
Baby, it was only a few drinks.
It's always only two drinks.
- Steven, come on.
- What?
All right, just...
let me give her a kiss, okay?
Okay.
And you have the best mommy in the world.
That's true, but... but Mommy's trying to get us home.
And you've had too much to drink, so...
Low of 46.
On Sunday, partly sunny...
Shannon!
Hey.
- You guys are everywhere.
- Hi.
- What are you drinking?
- This guy here.
- Grab a table, Salo.
- Good to see you again.
What do you want, man?
What are you drinking?
I think I'm on my way out.
Don't worry about it.
I'm buying, so...
might as well have one.
A near beer.
- Non-alcoholic?
- Yeah.
Uh, four, one...
- No alcohol?
- Not tonight.
Are you guys from here, the island?
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.
- Locals.
- Beautiful place to live.
Not as good as America though, right?
I wouldn't say that.
It's amazing here.
- It's fucking amazing here, right?
- Yeah, I love it.
I like Puerto Rican Chinese girls.
Here you go.
Go easy on that one there.
Yeah, I don't drink much anymore, but I still like the taste of beer, so...
I don't know, man.
I...
I quit for a while, and then I realized I really wanted... alcohol.
Salud.
Cheers.
Steven here is on a mission of mercy.
- A mission?
- Well...
He adopts needy kids from Dante's inferno and whisks them back to America.
We're adopting one.
The little girl you saw us on the beach with, she's a Haitian refugee.
And we're adopting her.
- Oh, that's lovely.
- Isn't it?
Did you ever spend any time down there?
Like...
No, not that region.
You?
Yeah, I spent some time down there.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I was doing like a... working with security for this place called PNC... guards medical supplies.
And it was kind of a...
- After the earthquake?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Anyway, here's to you.
It's a great thing what you're doing, man.
- Cheers.
- Appreciate it.
All right, guys, I told Shannon
I'd be five minutes, so I'm gonna head out.
- You can't go now, man.
- Why can't I?
You can't walk out on your round.
It's basic Puerto Rican manners.
We get you a round, you get us a round.
You owe us a round.
See, we got you the first round.
Now, you get us the second round.
I understand, okay.
I can...
I can do that.
Salo's got a lot of rules.
That's not a rule.
Come on, man.
Can I get another round of what he ordered?
- Four-and-four.
- Exactly.
There's etiquettes everywhere.
Is it expensive?
- What's that?
- Well, the whole process.
You know, cutting through all the red tape.
Um, I suppose if one does, but we went a more straightforward route.
No, I mean, is it hard... like, do you have to need an expeditor or do they bilk you for more and more money or anything?
I mean, you know, I...
I can't speak to that.
The waiting is difficult.
You know, but...
- There it is.
- You guys having another?
Yeah.
Here, brother.
You got to drink that.
Um, let's see.
Um, this should cover both rounds.
You guys have a great evening.
All right, bud.
- Is that for me, dude?
- We're not good enough for you?
- Shannon, it's not what you think.
- Have you lost your mind?
I didn't do anything, I promise.
I didn't know where you were.
You call me from a police station in the middle of the night.
They wouldn't let me just walk out of here on my own.
I had no choice.
It's the way they do things here.
Have you been drinking?
No, the guy dumped beer on me.
It was the weird people from the cabin that we keep running into.
They just twisted the story all around.
Sir.
Sign here, will you please?
Is this really happening?
Are we really back here?
I didn't do...
Nina, um...
Oui.
Nina, I'm sorry
Mommy had to wake you up in the middle of the night.
I hope you can forgive me.
Yeah?
Hello.
Heard it was the wild, wild west out there, huh?
It was, um, a misunderstanding.
Yeah, you had a run-in with some troublemakers, I understand?
Yes, actually, I did.
I was attacked for no reason.
I tried to explain that to your officers.
Yeah, well, a nice family like you shouldn't have to deal with that type of nonsense.
Life shouldn't have to be that complicated.
That's my card if you need anything.
And who might this little florecita be?
It's our daughter, Nina.
Lovely.
Well, look, we really love tourists here, so please enjoy yourselves.
Do yourself a favor...
stay out of bars for awhile, okay?
Yes, sir.
You up?
Yeah.
Baby, I'm sorry about last night.
It won't happen again.
Do you know what I... what I really think would make... everything better?
What?
Pancakes.
Okay.
- That's easy.
- I'm the world's cheapest date.
You order pancakes, I'll see if Nina's awake.
Okay.
Nina, honey.
Nina, honey.
Steven!
She's not up here!
What?
What do you mean she's not here?
Nina!
Honey?
Nina.
Nina!
Her shoes are gone!
The door was locked.
She's not here.
- Nina!
- Nina!
Nina!
- I'll ask reception.
- SOkay.
- Nina!
- Nina!
Hi.
I'm looking for my daughter.
She was in her room.
She's been missing...
I don't know for how long.
- Nina!
- She's seven years old,
- She's about this tall.
- Excuse me, sir, can I help you?
Yeah, our daughter's missing.
Okay, how old is she?
Uh, she's seven, she's Haitian.
Maybe you saw her come through the lobby?
I'm sorry.
- She was wearing...
- She was wearing, uh, pink pajama pants
- with polka dots and a blue t-shirt.
- Okay, calm down, calm down.
You know, the little ones, they go where they want and suddenly they turn up, so...
- Oh my God, Steven!
- ... not to worry.
- Sir?
Sir?
- The pool!
- She's in the pool!
- Sir?
This isn't happening.
Someone on your staff had to see her.
Mr. Mayer, there's certain protocol that we follow here, and we're doing that.
Getting angry with the staff?
It's not gonna help.
- What about security footage?
- We're looking into that.
She can't have just disappeared.
Children do wander off.
What?
A seven-year-old with a complex past, brand new set of circumstances, bewildered, overwhelmed.
We're looking into every possibility.
And considering the conflict the other night, we have to investigate that.
Can you make a list of other places you've been since you arrived and the people that you met?
And also, do you have any photos of Nina?
I'll get my computer.
If she did wander off alone, she's probably out there hungry by now.
Someone has to notice a little girl all alone.
What about the adoption agency?
- How well did they know her?
- We've been calling them.
We're waiting for Nina's passport to come through.
They didn't answer yesterday.
I'm trying to bring up her profile picture on the website, but... there's no website.
How much did you pay for this adoption?
Uh... $60,000.
Excuse me.
We'll be in touch.
I'm sorry.
We've been parents for 48 hours.
She couldn't have walked out on us, could she?
What do you mean?
I mean, she couldn't have wanted to, right?
She seemed so happy.
AII I ever wanted to be was a mother.
Pretend with my little sister,
I'd... bathe her and feed her and tuck her in at night.
I swore that when I had kids of my own
I would never abandon them the way that my birth mother... mother abandoned me.
So we have to find her, okay?
We will, okay?
We will.
I just... because... because I don't know what to do, Steven, and I don't know where she is.
I'm going back to that office.
You think that that's a good idea?
No one's answering the phone, the website's down.
I'm gonna go confront her directly.
Maybe we should just let the cops handle that.
The cops don't care, Shannon.
We're tourists.
They got enough problems of their own.
- Just... just keep looking.
- Okay, go.
I'll keep looking, okay.
What the fuck?
Nina?
Perdon.
Yeah.
- Mrs. Mayer.
- You had some new info?
Well, we contacted the consulate and your paperwork was never processed.
No Gabrielle Reigert or Nina Duvalier.
That has to be a mistake.
Let me guess.
She told you she would contact you when your passport came in, so all Nina had to do was wander off at the appointed time into her waiting arms.
No, um...
No, our room was locked.
We would've heard the door open.
The scam is called reclaiming.
And, unfortunately, it's not rare.
What they do, they get as much money as they can, take the kid back, on to the next victim.
New web site, new city, new country.
It's very hard to track.
- It's all over Asia now.
- This website had, um... it had all these, uh, links, and it had testimonials.
Well, websites will do that.
Where's your husband?
Sir, sir...
No, no.
Uh, just keep that.
Thank you.
I don't know exactly.
He's out looking for her.
Yeah, we heard about a break-in in Old San Juan.
I don't know anything about that.
We don't need vigilantes.
We're gonna find the girl.
Comandante, this, um... this scam that you're talking about... it might be true... but it also might not be.
- So you have to keep looking for her.
- We will keep looking.
- You have to find her.
- We will.
Sorry, have you seen this little girl?
Sorry, I'm just looking for this little girl.
Can you just look at the photo?
Esta Nina.
Um, have you seen her?
Esta Nina.
Can you...
no, you haven't seen her?
This little girl, have you seen her?
I did a really stupid thing, Shannon.
We did a stupid thing.
No, I did.
You looked so happy.
We just finished painting her room.
Everything was set.
And then I get an email out of nowhere saying the whole thing fell apart.
What are you talking about?
She said she could make it go away.
She... she said no one would know... so I paid her.
- We'd already paid.
- I paid her more to make it work.
How much more?
Another 30.
Fuck.
Fuck, Steven.
Steven, you're telling me you bought our daughter on the black market.
No, no.
No.
She was an official expeditor, Shannon.
She had...
you saw her credentials, and that office.
Baby, we were so close.
What was I supposed to do?
What about run it by me?
Communicate?
I wanted everything to work out.
And so what?
You decided that you would just take shortcuts as usual?
We were on a waiting list back home, remember?
Another two to three more years.
I was fine to wait.
Oh, sure, you were fine to wait.
If you already paid her, why didn't she just not show up?
Fuck.
What?
There were... additional fees...
this week.
The money came through yesterday.
- I guess she was waiting...
- Are you fucking serious?
...and the passport story was there to just string us along.
More than the 30?
Not as much... another 10.
We're never gonna see her again.
Maybe she was never ours.
- Maybe none of this was real.
- It was real.
You felt it too, didn't you?
Yeah, I thought I did.
But... is she... does she even belong to us, legally?
If this is a scam, if they're criminals,
- do we even stick around?
- She's a little girl.
She's out there somewhere with God knows what kinds of people.
She was supposed to be our daughter.
Doesn't that mean we're supposed to try?
Of course it does.
Yes.
Let's...
let's drive around some more.
I just...
I need some time, okay?
You drive around.
Shit.
Hey, Shannon.
Shannon?
It's Benjamin and Veronica.
- I just wanted to say we're really...
- I know that.
...sorry for what happened the other night.
It was just a misunderstanding,
I know Steven didn't pick a fight with you.
He's so passive, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
He didn't pick a fight with me, it was my buddy Salo, anyway.
We just didn't know that he didn't drink.
Look, my daughter's missing, so I don't... can we just not?
You're daughter's missing?
Where is she?
Yeah, it's all...
it's all part of some scam.
A scam?
Yeah, these people, they just... they, um... they give you a little girl, they get a 100 grand from you... and then they take her back.
100 grand?
Oh my God.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Did you talk to the police?
- Yeah, I called the cops.
- What did they say?
- I mean, what's the next step?
- Will you excuse me?
How do you not tell me about something that big...
Shannon, I knew if I told you about the money you would've just...
If you told me about the money, I would've said it was a bad idea.
Yeah, okay, well, I thought I was making a good decision for us.
This isn't about doing something good.
It's about your complete lack ofjudgment.
Thanks.
A marriage is a partnership, okay?
You never talk to me!
We are still gonna talk about this.
I know where she is.
- I'm calling the police.
- Wait.
Benjamin has her.
- What are you talking about?
- I can take you to her.
Why should we trust you?
We don't have another option.
Is she okay?
She's fine.
She's just scared.
- Why are you helping us?
- Yeah.
Because I don't want to be a part of it.
Say a fucking word I'm gonna blow your head off, okay?
Go to the wall.
Put your hands up on the wall.
- Against the wall now!
- Hands down.
Shh.
Put your hands behind your back.
Get the tape.
Be quiet.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right, stay there.
Wallet?
All right.
Hotel room key.
Check them out, you drive their rental car.
See you there.
Let's move.
Feet up.
Welcome to your Puerto Rican vacations, motherfuckers.
Get the fuck out!
Hurry up!
Move.
Move.
Move, you fucking gringo.
Move, you motherfucker!
Sit down.
Sit the fuck down!
Sit the fuck down!
Motherfucker, I will shoot your fucking brains out.
What did you do with Nina?
She's fine, really.
Nina's fine, no problem.
Please, just tell us what you want.
All in good time.
So you got somebody in Chicago that looks after your money?
- Our money?
- Yeah.
Shannon, you come from money.
And you had a big fucking pile of it even before the accident, right?
There's nothing left.
Really?
$2.9 million settlement?
Think I'm a fucking moron?
August 12th, 2010, "Chicago Sun Times,"
"Chicago woman receives civil settlement in city tragedy.
Late afternoon it was ruled that the Cooke County Department of Public Works was at fault when a waste disposal truck collided with Shannon Mayer, 27, of Oak Park... "
Please, stop it.
"... claiming the life of her unborn daughter. "
- That's enough!
- And you lost the ability to bear more children.
All right, so you have money.
What did you do with it?
I mean, you don't strike me as the extravagant type.
We... we bought a house.
We, um... we rebuilt a life.
We started a charitable trust.
- We adopted Nina.
- You know what you did?
You invested.
- Right?
- He's a... toy designer.
We don't really make that much, and I haven't worked since the accident.
What kind of fucking toys do you make?
All right, you didn't work after the accident?
I'm telling you, man, there's nothing there.
Steven... you're supposed to be a smart guy.
I know all about you.
All right, we have something in common here.
You know this woman, Gabrielle Reigert?
That's not her real name.
Her real name is Angie.
So this funny, little woman comes up to me in some shit-hole, business-class airport lounge and says, "Come do this thing."
"Who is this woman?" I'm thinking.
"What is she, fucking Intel?
What is she, Blackwater?
Christian Outreach?"
I don't give a fuck.
She says, "I pay cash.
$25,000 a pop."
So to be fair to you, it's not just you and your bank accounts that I don't altogether trust.
Like maybe she burned me a little bit.
And after your wife and I had a little get together in town... nothing untoward, brother, nothing untoward... well, I decided we had to check out a few things.
See, usually we just take the kid and you leave the island burning in shame.
But necessity brings us together one more time.
And while we're here, you know, we're gonna do this other thing because this is, after all, what we do for a living.
You're wasting your time.
I don't think I am, Steven.
Okay, we want to do Bank of America or Citibank?
Bank of America?
Okay, Steven, now we need the passcode, so it'll all go a lot easier if you just give it to me.
I'm telling you, you are wasting your fucking time.
All right, now I think you're lying to me.
And I don't think you're the only one who's lying to me.
But I'm telling you something, I'm sick of being lied to, so let's be really clear about what the stakes are.
Those are the stakes!
We'll blow her fucking brains out!
- Leave her alone!
- Blow her brains out next!
- Leave her alone!
- Tell him the fucking password!
- Leave her alone!
- The password!
Shit.
All right, okay, all right, all right!
Okay!
All right.
What is it?
7-1-2... 7-3-5.
Is that it?
- Hold on, just...
- Let go of her.
- Let go of her.
- Let her go!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, hey, come on now.
- You piece of shit.
- Shut the fuck up, motherfucker.
Hey, calm down.
Everybody take a deep breath, okay?
Baby, I shouldn't have been so drunk that night.
If I wasn't and you didn't have to come get me, none of this would have ever happened.
We wouldn't be here.
I know I can't change the past.
- God knows I wish I could.
- Baby, this is not your fault.
But I can get us out of this, I promise you.
I promise.
Good morning.
So, listen...
I got an email from Jerry, your man in Chicago.
Uh, what's his name, Rosenberg something?
Anyway, he emailed, the transfer's gonna take 48 hours.
So today is gonna be kind of a lay-around day, you know, nothing to do.
Look, I'm not a monster or anything,
I'll bring you some food and water, and maybe you can even take a shower or something.
How do you live with yourself?
I'm sorry.
What was that?
How do you live with yourself?
Yeah, you know, it's rough, Shannon, but, just...
I do what I can.
What happens to Nina?
You can have her when this is all done.
I don't give a fuck about the kid.
If things go smooth, the kid's yours.
How do we know she's alive?
Well, that's a fair question.
Let me get back to you on that, Steven.
Okay?
Answer the fucking question!
You're gonna get to see your daughter.
She's in that house, Shannon, I know it.
- They're gonna kill us, no matter what.
- No, no, no.
We're gonna get the money.
They'll give us Nina back.
- They can blindfold us and...
- Nobody even knows that we're here.
Shannon, we are getting out of this.
You go into the bank.
You have to tell them everything.
No, baby, no.
No, we have to give them what they want.
It's only money.
They're after the money.
They'll let us go.
Somebody help us!
Somebody!
Somebody help us!
Help!
Somebody help us!
Somebody!
They think you want to kill them.
Nina showered, ready for bed?
Mm-hmm.
You want me to check on her?
A little bit to the left.
- Left, over here.
- Here?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Angie.
Benjamin, I've got another job for you
- Starting next week.
- Oh, yeah?
It's a West Coast couple, San Francisco, arriving Saturday.
Great.
Listen, Benny, um... this job's not as good as the one we're doing now, but I'm still confident we'll see about 15 out of it each.
- Price is going down?
- Well, just a little.
It's still worth it.
I might be able to squeeze a little bit more out of them.
So, I'll see you in a few days with Nina, right?
- Of course.
- Okay.
Everything okay?
Oh, Waldo.
Listen to the happy laughter of those friendly natives.
Then there's the one about the...
All right.
Showtime.
That's today.
Okay?
It's a big day.
We're gonna go to the bank.
We'll get you the money.
Okay, we're gonna cooperate and we're gonna get you the money... and then we're gonna forget all about you.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Please, just take the money and let us go.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
I don't want any violence.
We good?
When you get to the bank,
Salo's gonna uncuff you, then you're on your own.
He's gonna be following you, but not like he knows you.
If you do anything or if you tip anybody off, last thing he does before he leaves the bank, is shoot you.
If he shoots you, that means we're not getting our money, which basically means, we're shooting you in anger.
It goes without saying, we don't want to shoot you or your wife.
So that's it, that's the play.
It's up to you, man.
Don't fuck up.
Hey, we're gonna leave soon.
Yeah?
And we're gonna do the same thing we did before.
We're gonna pack up and travel and maybe meet another family and play the same game.
Okay?
You're doing great.
Hi, my name's Steven Mayer.
Mr. Lopez is expecting me.
Oh, yes, Mr. Mayer, the transfer, right?
Yes.
Please, let me check your documents.
It's a long drive out here.
We're staying in...
is it "Monaba"?
- Maunabo.
- Maunabo.
There's a big tunnel out there, yeah?
Oh, yes.
Let me get Mr. Lopez for you.
Okay.
Alfonso Lopez, how do you do?
Uh, Steven Mayer, thank you so much for getting this done.
Unusual transaction.
Sometimes in Puerto Rico we have problems with money laundering.
Oh, we're, uh...
we're buying land here, actually.
It cost $600,000, but they said they would knock off $100,000 if we paid cash, so...
Excuse me.
Enjoy your property.
Thank you.
Give me the money bag.
Not until I have Nina and my wife.
This isn't time to fuck with me, okay?
Hey!
I need to get to Maunabo.
Quickly please, por favor.
We good?
We got a problem.
What kind of problem?
I lost him.
We got out of the bank, he just took off with the fucking money.
Stay there.
Pack up, laptops, everything.
Meet me at Angie's in 15 minutes.
Okay.
Can I use your phone?
It's an emergency.
It's Steven Mayer.
I'm on my way to Maunabo.
Shannon's there in a shed somewhere and Nina's there.
Benjamin kidnapped us.
Okay, Steve, I need you to slow down.
- Tell me where you are.
- I'm in a cab.
Okay, so the place... it's about a mile after you come out of the Maunabo tunnel.
Um, you'll see a boat in a tree.
Okay, look, this is what I need you to do, okay?
I need you to take that cab to the station.
We're on our way to Maunabo.
And as soon as we find your family,
I will call you, okay?
There won't be enough time.
- You got him?
- What?
- Do you have him?
- No.
Keep looking.
Boy, oh, boy.
Nina, stay in your room!
All right, it's gonna be a left up here.
You'll see...
you'll see a boat in a tree.
He's here.
Load the shotgun, take the safety off.
When he gets out of the car, put him on the ground.
Wait here a minute.
I'll be right out.
- We're going back to San Juan?
- Yeah.
Lie down.
Drop the bag.
Salo, you piece of shit, you lost him.
He's coming back here now.
The police will be here any second.
You still have time to go.
I said drop the fucking bag.
They're gonna arrest you.
Get the fuck out of here!
Go!
Get out of here!
I said drop it!
Benjamin is on his way back.
What's he paying you?
Whatever it is, I'll double it.
I have money right here.
- Look, I'll show you.
- Hey!
Turn around!
Turn around now!
Let's go!
Get in the house!
Shannon, come on, let's go!
Nina!
Come on.
Good girl.
Come on.
- Is she okay?
- She's good, she's good.
Come on, in you go.
Come on.
Okay, drive.
Go, go, go.
Shit.
He's turning around.
He's coming.
Steven!
It's okay.
Get down!
Baby, you okay?
Nobody move, nobody move.
Stay still, Shannon.
I'm gonna get out and come to that window, okay?
Okay.
Shit.
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah.
Okay, Nina, you're gonna come with me.
You're gonna come with me.
Hang on to me, Nina.
Shannon, grab me.
Grab me, grab me.
Grab me, Shannon.
Shannon.
Baby?
- What?
- You got to let me go.
You're gonna need both hands.
Steven, you've got to let me go.
Baby.
You've got to save Nina!
All right, grab onto something, honey.
- Grab on!
- I got it.
I got it.
Okay, I got it.
Come on, it's okay.
Come on.
Just look at me.
Stay here, all right?
All right, Shannon, give me your hands.
Shannon, hang on!
Hang on!
Hang on!
Steven!
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Grab the strap!
- I can't.
You got to do it.
- Grab the strap.
- I can't!
Come on, you got to do it, just grab it.
Mama, Mama!
- Where's Benjamin?
- His car's down there.
- I think he's dead.
- Anybody else here?
The girlfriend might still be at the house.
If you send someone, maybe you can catch her.
You okay, little one?
You okay?
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Please, to the car.
- What's in the bag?
- Uh...
Lot of cash.
- Go.
- Sir.
Stay here and call forensics to take pictures of the car.
- I'll take care of them.
- Okay.
Go.
Hey, uh...
I would like to apologize for not believing you guys
- about those two.
- It's fine.
It's not necessary.
Thank you.
Well, you're safe now.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I got you.
- You guys okay?
- It's okay.
Yeah, you?
Don't fucking move!
- Okay, okay.
- Don't fucking move!
Do not move!
- We're gonna go for a little walk.
- Shannon, just stay calm.
- No, no, no, no.
Just take the money.
- Stay calm.
Steven!
- You son of a bitch!
- What?
- Just take the money!
- Oh, I'm gonna take the money.
Steven!
Steven!
One more stop.
Help!
Go home, Nina.
Steven!
Hey, you want this?
- Go on up.
- All right.
- Home sweet home, Nina.
- Ben?
- What the fuck, Ben?
- What kind of woman uses children?
- Fuck off!
- Sit the fuck down.
What the fuck, Ben?
Big day, Angie.
Change of plans.
Where's the husband?
Oh, he's in the trunk... trunk of the car out there.
We got a cop car.
We got two cars I got to get rid of.
Dead bodies, cops.
I don't know where Veronica is.
Salo's dead.
These are not my problems, Ben.
What's mine is yours, Angie.
AII I'm saying is, we should be discreet.
Uh-huh.
An opportunity arose and I had to act fast.
- An opportunity?
- They had more money.
So, you got more money.
That's great.
Like I said, it's been a big day.
Of course.
Shannon, this is Angie.
Angie, Shannon.
Angie is sort of the mastermind of this whole thing.
She organizes everything and she seduces the young couples like you who don't want the, you know, fresh new puppies from the pet shop.
You'll take the older ones 'cause you got a conscience.
Nina, sweetie, will you go play in your room?
The adults have to talk.
Go on, baby.
Like I said, it's been a big day.
Ben, I think we should do what needs to be done.
We'll do it together.
We're partners, after all.
I'll help you...
cars, bodies.
- Yeah?
- Okay.
Okay.
You got my cut?
Of course I got your cut.
How much?
The usual.
25.
50% of 50 grand.
How much you pay, Shannon?
Ben, there is a lot more money coming in.
You're gonna get a lot more money, sweetheart.
Every little bit counts, right?
I'm gonna give you more...
- No!
- Nina!
Go back to your room.
Go back to your room.
Nina!
What happened, bitch?
You hurt your ankle?
Fuck you.
You don't have to do this.
You can have the money.
You can have whatever you want.
We're good people.
I know you're good people.
I mean, I know the difference.
You know?
You would have been really good for Nina.
Yeah, we would have been.
Yeah, we would have been.
We would have taken really good care of her.
Please.
Please, please don't kill me.
Put it down!
Put the gun down!
Or what, Steven, you gonna shoot me in the back?
- Yes, I will.
- We both know you're not gonna do that.
- I swear to God I'll do it.
- Yeah?
Your wife's got more balls than you
- and she's unarmed.
- Don't fucking test me!
Put the gun down!
I've seen the way you look at him.
I know.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- Oh my God.
- It's okay now.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
- Nina.
- Nina.
Nina, no, no, no.
Put... put the gun down on the ground.
We're not gonna hurt you.
We want to take care of you.
Nina.
Nina.
- It's okay now, sweetheart.
- It's okay.
We want to take care of you, Nina, but you have to put the gun down.
We want to take you home.
Okay?
And you'll have your own room... your yellow room, Nina.
You want to come with us?
Great job.
Good girl.
Hey.
You all right?
You don't have to do this anymore, okay?
We're gonna take care of you.
Come on.
You're okay.
It's okay.
Good girl.

Tonight, a country brought to its knees.
A 7.2 magnitude earthquake has hit Haiti.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, was literally torn apart.
The earthquake lasted all of a minute.
The intensity so strong, within seconds a cloud of dust covered the city.
And many people are still trapped in the rubble.
Some may still be alive, but getting out alive will be There's truly no way of knowing just how many people are dead.
Bodies are reportedly stacked in streets.
It's feared the number of people killed could now reach 200,000.
200,000 children without a mother or father even before this earthquake.
A country which only seems to know the worst of times is tonight just trying to survive.

AND WHO MIGHT THIS LITTLEFLORECITA BE?
IT'S OUR DAUGHTER, NINA.
LOVELY.
WELL, LOOK, WE REALLY LOVE TOURISTS HERE,
SO PLEASE ENJOY YOURSELVES.
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR-- STAY OUT OF BARS FOR AWHILE, OKAY?
YES, SIR.
YOU UP?
YEAH.
BABY, I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I...
WHAT I REALLY THINK WOULD MAKE
EVERYTHING BETTER?
WHAT?
PANCAKES.
OKAY.
- THAT'S EASY.
- I'M THE WORLD'S CHEAPEST DATE.
YOU ORDER PANCAKES, I'LL SEE IF NINA'S AWAKE.
OKAY.
NINA, HONEY.
NINA, HONEY.
STEVEN!
SHE'S NOT UP HERE!
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE'S NOT HERE?
NINA!
HONEY?
NINA.
NINA!
HER SHOES ARE GONE!
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
SHE'S NOT HERE.
- NINA!
- NINA!
NINA!
- I'LL ASK RECEPTION.
- OKAY.
- NINA!
- NINA!
HI.
I'M LOOKING FOR MY DAUGHTER.
SHE WAS IN HER ROOM.
SHE'S BEEN MISSING-- I DON'T KNOW FOR HOW LONG.
- NINA!
- SHE'S SEVEN YEARS OLD,
SHE'S ABOUT THIS TALL.
-EXCUSEME ,SIR, CAN I HELP YOU?
YEAH, OUR DAUGHTER'S MISSING.
OKAY, HOW OLD IS SHE?
UH, SHE'S SEVEN, SHE'S HAITIAN.
MAYBE YOU SAW HER COME THROUGH THE LOBBY?
I'M SORRY.
- SHE WAS WEARING--
- SHE WAS WEARING, UH, PINK PAJAMA PANTS
- WITH POLKA DOTS AND A BLUE T-SHIRT.
- OKAY, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.
YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE ONES, THEY GO WHERE THEY WANT
AND SUDDENLY THEY TURN UP, SO...
- OH MY GOD, STEVEN!
- ...
NOT TO WORRY.
- SIR?
SIR?
- THE POOL!
- SHE'S IN THE POOL!
- SIR?
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
SOMEONE ON YOUR STAFF HAD TO SEE HER.
MR. MAYER, THERE'S CERTAIN PROTOCOL
THAT WE FOLLOW HERE, AND WE'RE DOING THAT.
GETTING ANGRY WITH THE STAFF?
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP.
- WHAT ABOUT SECURITY FOOTAGE?
- WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.
SHE CAN'T HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED.
CHILDREN DO WANDER OFF.
WHAT?
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD WITH A COMPLEX PAST,
BRAND NEW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES,
BEWILDERED, OVERWHELMED.
WE'RE LOOKING INTOnEVERY POSSIBILITY.
AND CONSIDERING THE CONFLICT THE OTHER NIGHT,
WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THAT.
CAN YOU MAKE A LIST OF OTHER PLACES YOU'VE BEEN
SINCE YOU ARRIVED AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MET?
AND ALSO, DO YOU HAVE ANY PHOTOS OF NINA?
I'LL GET MY COMPUTER.
IF SHE DID WANDER OFF ALONE,
SHE'S PROBABLY OUT THERE HUNGRY BY NOW.
SOMEONE HAS TO NOTICEnA LITTLE GIRL ALL ALONE.
WHAT ABOUT THE ADOPTION AGENCY?
- HOW WELL DID THEY KNOW HER?
- WE'VE BEEN CALLING THEM.
WE'RE WAITING FOR NINA'S PASSPORT TO COME THROUGH.
THEY DIDN'T ANSWER YESTERDAY.
I'M TRYING TO BRING UP HER PROFILE PICTURE ON THE WEBSITE, BUT...
THERE'S NO WEBSITE.
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THIS ADOPTION?
UH... $60,000.
EXCUSE ME.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.
I'M SORRY.
WE'VE BEEN PARENTS FOR 48 HOURS.
SHE COULDN'T HAVE WALKED OUT ON US, COULD SHE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN, SHE COULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO, RIGHT?
SHE SEEMED SO HAPPY.
ALL I EVER WANTED TO BE WAS A MOTHER.
PRETEND WITH MY LITTLE SISTER,
I'D...
BATHE HER AND FEED HER
AND TUCK HER IN AT NIGHT.
I SWORE THAT WHEN I HAD KIDS OF MY OWN
I WOULD NEVER ABANDON THEM
THE WAY THAT MY BIRTH MOTHER--
MOTHER ABANDONED ME.
SO WE HAVE TO FIND HER, OKAY?
WE WILL, OKAY?
WE WILL.
I JUST-- BECAUSE--
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, STEVEN,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
I'M GOING BACK TO THAT OFFICE.
YOU THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?
NO ONE'S ANSWERING THE PHONE,
THE WEBSITE'S DOWN.
I'M GONNA GO CONFRONT HER DIRECTLY.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LET THE COPS HANDLE THAT.
THE COPS DON'T CARE, SHANNON.
WE'RE TOURISTS.
THEY GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS OF THEIR OWN.
- JUST-
- JUST KEEP LOOKING.
- OKAY, GO.
I'LL KEEP LOOKING, OKAY.
WHAT THE FUCK?
NINA?
PERDON.
- YEAH.
- MRS. MAYER.
- YOU HAD SOME NEW INFO?
WELL, WE CONTACTED THE CONSULATE
AND YOUR PAPERWORK WAS NEVER PROCESSED.
NO GABRIELLE REIGERT
OR NINA DUVALIER.
THAT HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.
LET ME GUESS.
SHE TOLD YOU SHE WOULD CONTACT YOU
WHEN YOUR PASSPORT CAME IN,
SO ALL NINA HAD TO DO WAS WANDER OFF
AT THE APPOINTED TIME INTO HER WAITING ARMS.
NO, UM...
NO, OUR ROOM WAS LOCKED.
WE WOULD'VE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN.
THE SCAM IS CALLED RECLAIMING.
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT RARE.
WHAT THEY DO,
THEY GET AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN,
TAKE THE KID BACK,
ON TO THE NEXT VICTIM.
NEW WEB SITE, NEW CITY, NEW COUNTRY.
- IT'S VERY HARD TO TRACK.
IT'S ALL OVER ASIA NOW.
- THIS WEBSITE HAD, UM--
IT HAD ALL THESE, UH,
LINKS, AND IT HAD TESTIMONIALS.
WELL, WEBSITES WILL DO THAT.
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?
SIR, SIR...
NO, NO.
UH, JUST KEEP THAT.
THANK YOU.
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.
HE'S OUT LOOKING FOR HER.
YEAH, WE HEARD ABOUT A BREAK-IN IN OLD SAN JUAN.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.
WE DON'T NEED VIGILANTES.
WE'RE GONNA FIND THE GIRL.
COMANDANTE, THIS, UM--
THIS SCAM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT...
IT MIGHT BE TRUE...
BUT IT ALSO MIGHT NOT BE.
- SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING FOR HER.
- WE WILL KEEP LOOKING.
- YOU HAVE TO FIND HER.
- WE WILL.
SORRY, HAVE YOU SEEN THIS LITTLE GIRL?
SORRY, I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL.
ESTA NIÑA.
UM, HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
ESTA NIÑA.
CAN YOU-
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER?
THIS LITTLE GIRL,nHAVE YOU SEEN HER?
I DID A REALLY STUPID THING, SHANNON.
WE DID A STUPID THING.
NO, I DID.
YOU LOOKED SO HAPPY.
WE JUST FINISHED PAINTING HER ROOM.
EVERYTHING WAS SET.
AND THEN I GET AN EMAIL OUT OF NOWHERE
SAYING THE WHOLE THING FELL APART.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SHE SAID SHE COULD MAKE IT GO AWAY.
SHE-
- SHE SAID NO ONE WOULD KNOW...
SO I PAID HER.
WE'D ALREADY PAID.
I PAID HER MORE TO MAKE IT WORK.
HOW MUCH MORE?
ANOTHER 30.
FUCK.
FUCK, STEVEN.
STEVEN, YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU BOUGHT OUR DAUGHTER ON THE BLACK MARKET.
NO, NO.
NO.
SHE WAS AN OFFICIAL EXPEDITOR, SHANNON.
SHE HAD-- YOU SAW HER CREDENTIALS,
AND THAT OFFICE.
BABY, WE WERE SO CLOSE.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
WHAT ABOUT RUN IT BY ME?
COMMUNICATE?
I WANTED EVERYTHING TO WORK OUT.
AND SO WHAT?
YOU DECIDED THAT YOU WOULD
JUST TAKE SHORTCUTS AS USUAL?
WE WERE ON A WAITING LIST BACK HOME, REMEMBER?
ANOTHER TWO TO THREE MORE YEARS.
I WAS FINE TO WAIT.
OH, SURE, YOU WERE FINE TO WAIT.
IF YOU ALREADY PAID HER,
WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST NOT SHOW UP?
FUCK.
WHAT?
THERE WERE...
ADDITIONAL FEES...
THIS WEEK.
THE MONEY CAME THROUGH YESTERDAY.
- I GUESS SHE WAS WAITING...
- ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?
...AND THE PASSPORT STORY WAS THERE TO JUST STRING US ALONG.
MORE THAN THE 30?
NOT AS MUCH-- ANOTHER 10.
WE'RE NEVER GONNA SEE HER AGAIN.
MAYBE SHE WAS NEVER OURS.
- MAYBE NONE OF THIS WAS REAL.
- IT WAS REAL.
YOU FELT IT TOO, DIDN'T YOU?
YEAH, I THOUGHT I DID.
BUT...
IS SHE...
DOES SHE EVEN BELONG TO US, LEGALLY?
IF THIS IS A SCAM, IF THEY'RE CRIMINALS,
- DO WE EVEN STICK AROUND?
- SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL.
SHE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE
WITH GOD KNOWS WHAT KINDS OF PEOPLE.
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR DAUGHTER.
DOESN'T THAT MEAN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TRY?
OF COURSE IT DOES.
YES.
LET'S-- LET'S DRIVE AROUND SOME MORE.
I JUST-- I NEED SOME TIME, OKAY?
YOU DRIVE AROUND.
SHIT.
- HEY, SHANNON.
- SHANNON?
IT'S BENJAMIN AND VERONICA.
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY WE'RE REALLY SORRY...
- I KNOW THAT.
...FOR WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT.
IT WAS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING,
I KNOW STEVEN DIDN'T PICK A FIGHT WITH YOU.HE'S SO PASSIVE, HE WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.
HE DIDN'T PICK A FIGHT WITH ME,
IT WAS MY BUDDY SALO, ANYWAY.
WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T DRINK.
LOOK, MY DAUGHTER'S MISSING, SO I DON'T--
CAN WE JUST NOT?
YOU'RE DAUGHTER'S MISSING?
WHERE IS SHE?
YEAH, IT'S ALL-- IT'S ALL PART OF SOME SCAM.
A SCAM?
YEAH, THESE PEOPLE, THEY JUST-
- THEY, UM...
THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE GIRL,
THEY GET A 100 GRAND FROM YOU...
AND THEN THEY TAKE HER BACK.
100 GRAND?
OH MY GOD.
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- DID YOU TALK TO THE POLICE?
- YEAH, I CALLED THE COPS.
- WHAT DID THEY SAY?
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?
- WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
HOW DO YOU NOT TELL ME ABOUT SOMETHING THAT BIG--
SHANNON, I KNEW IF I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE MONEY YOU WOULD'VE JUST--
IF YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE MONEY,
I WOULD'VE SAID IT WAS A BAD IDEA.
YEAH, OKAY, WELL, I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING A GOOD DECISION FOR US.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT DOING SOMETHING GOOD.
IT'S ABOUT YOUR COMPLETE LACK OF JUDGMENT.
THANKS.
A MARRIAGE IS A PARTNERSHIP, OKAY?
YOU NEVER TALK TO ME!
WE ARE STILL GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS.
I KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
- I'M CALLING THE POLICE.
- WAIT.
BENJAMIN HAS HER.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I CAN TAKE YOU TO HER.
WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU?
WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER OPTION.
IS SHE OKAY?
SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S JUST SCARED.
- WHY ARE YOU HELPING US?
- YEAH.
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.
SAY A FUCKING WORD I'M GONNA BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF, OKAY?
- GO TO THE WALL.
PUT YOUR HANDS UP ON THE WALL.
AGAINST THE WALL NOW!
HANDS DOWN.
SHH.
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.
GET THE TAPE.
BE QUIET.
THANK YOU.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, STAY THERE.
WALLET?
ALL RIGHT.
HOTEL ROOM KEY.
CHECK THEM OUT,
YOU DRIVE THEIR RENTAL CAR.
SEE YOU THERE.
LET'S MOVE.
FEET UP.
WELCOME TO YOUR PUERTO RICAN VACATIONS, MOTHERFUCKERS.
GET THE FUCK OUT!
HURRY UP!
MOVE.
MOVE.
MOVE, YOU FUCKING GRINGO.
MOVE, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
SIT DOWN.
SIT THE FUCK DOWN!
SIT THE FUCK DOWN!
MOTHERFUCKER, I WILL SHOOT YOUR FUCKING BRAINS OUT.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH NINA?
SHE'S FINE, REALLY.
NINA'S FINE, NO PROBLEM.
PLEASE, JUST TELL US WHAT YOU WANT.
nail IN GOOD TIME.
SO YOU GOT SOMEBODY IN CHICAGO
THAT LOOKS AFTER YOUR MONEY?
- OUR MONEY?
- YEAH.
SHANNON, YOU COME FROM MONEY.
AND YOU HAD A BIGnFUCKING PILE OF IT
EVEN BEFOREnTHE ACCIDENT, RIGHT?
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.
REALLY?
$2.9 MILLION SETTLEMENT?
THINK I'M A FUCKING MORON?
AUGUST 12th, 2010, "CHICAGO SUN TIMES,"
"CHICAGO WOMAN RECEIVESCIVIL SETTLEMENTnIN CITY TRAGEDY.
LATE AFTERNOONnIT WAS RULED
THAT THE COOKE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKSWAS AT FAULT WHEN A WASTE DISPOSAL TRUCK
COLLIDED WITH SHANNON MAYER, 27, OF OAK PARK..."
PLEASE, STOP IT.
- "...
CLAIMING THE LIFE OF HER UNBORN DAUGHTER."
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
- AND YOU LOST THE ABILITY TO BEAR MORE CHILDREN.
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU HAVE MONEY.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT?
I MEAN, YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS THE EXTRAVAGANT TYPE.
WE-
- WE BOUGHT A HOUSE.
WE, UM-
- WE REBUILT A LIFE.
WE STARTEDnA CHARITABLE TRUST.
- WE ADOPTED NINA.
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID?
YOU INVESTED.
- RIGHT?
- HE'S A TOY DESIGNER.
WE DON'T REALLYnMAKE THAT MUCH,
AND I HAVEN'T WORKEDnSINCE THE ACCIDENT.
WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS DO YOU MAKE?
ALL RIGHT, YOU DIDN'T WORK AFTER THE ACCIDENT?
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN, THERE'S NOTHING THERE.
STEVEN...
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A SMART GUY.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON HERE.
YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN, GABRIELLE REIGERT?
THAT'S NOT HER REAL NAME.
HER REAL NAME IS ANGIE.
SO THIS FUNNY, LITTLE WOMAN
COMES UP TO ME IN SOME SHIT-HOLE,
BUSINESS-CLASS AIRPORT LOUNGE
AND SAYS, "COME DO THIS THING."
"WHO IS THIS WOMAN?" I'M THINKING.
"WHAT IS SHE, FUCKING INTEL?
WHAT IS SHE, BLACKWATER?
CHRISTIAN OUTREACH?"
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.
SHE SAYS, "I PAY CASH.
$25,000 A POP."
SO TO BE FAIR TO YOU,
IT'S NOT JUST YOU AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS
THAT I DON'T ALTOGETHER TRUST.
LIKE MAYBE SHE BURNED ME A LITTLE BIT.
AND AFTER YOUR WIFE AND I HAD A LITTLE GET TOGETHER IN TOWN--
NOTHING UNTOWARD, BROTHER, NOTHING UNTOWARD--
WELL, I DECIDED WE HAD TO CHECK OUT A FEW THINGS.
SEE, USUALLY WE JUST TAKE THE KID
AND YOU LEAVE THE ISLAND BURNING IN SHAME.
BUT NECESSITY BRINGS US TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME.
AND WHILE WE'RE HERE, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS OTHER THING
BECAUSE THIS IS, AFTER ALL, WHAT WE DO FOR A LIVING.
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
I DON'T THINK I AM, STEVEN.
OKAY, WE WANT TO DO BANK OF AMERICA OR CITIBANK?
BANK OF AMERICA?
OKAY, STEVEN, NOW WE NEED THE PASSCODE,
SO IT'LL ALL GO A LOT EASIER IF YOU JUST GIVE IT TO ME.
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR FUCKING TIME.
ALL RIGHT, NOW I THINK YOU'RE LYING TO ME.
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S LYING TO ME.
BUT I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING, I'M SICK OF BEING LIED TO.
SO LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE STAKES ARE.
THOSE ARE THE STAKES!
- WE'LL BLOW HER FUCKING BRAINS OUT!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- BLOW HER BRAINS OUT NEXT!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- TELL HIM THE FUCKING PASSWORD!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- THE PASSWORD!
SHIT.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
OKAY!
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?
7-1-2 7-3-5.
IS THAT IT?
- HOLD ON, JUST--
- LET GO OF HER.
- LET GO OF HER.
- LET HER GO!
- SHUT THE FUCK UP!
- HEY, HEY, COME ON NOW.
- YOU PIECE OF SHIT.
- SHUT THE FUCK UP, MOTHER FUCKER.
HEY, CALM DOWN.
EVERYBODY TAKE A DEEP BREATH, OKAY?
BABY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO DRUNK THAT NIGHT.
IF I WASN'T AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME GET ME,
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED.
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.
I KNOW I CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST.
- GOD KNOWS I WISH I COULD.
- BABY, THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.
BUT I CAN GET US OUT OF THIS, I PROMISE YOU.
I PROMISE.
GOOD MORNING.
SO, LISTEN...
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM JERRY,
YOUR MAN IN CHICAGO.
UH, WHAT'S HIS NAME, ROSENBERG SOMETHING?
ANYWAY, HE EMAILED,
THE TRANSFER'S GONNA TAKE 48 HOURS.
SO TODAY IS GONNA BE KIND OF A LAY-AROUND DAY,
YOU KNOW, NOTHING TO DO.
LOOK, I'M NOT A MONSTER OR ANYTHING,
AND I'LL BRING YOU SOME FOOD AND WATER.
AND MAYBE YOU CAN EVEN TAKE A SHOWER OR SOMETHING.
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF?
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS THAT?
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF?
YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S ROUGH, SHANNON,
BUT, JUST-- I DO WHAT I CAN.
WHAT HAPPENS TO NINA?
YOU CAN HAVE HER WHEN THIS IS ALL DONE.
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE KID.
IF THINGS GO SMOOTH, THE KID'S YOURS.
HOW DO WE KNOW SHE'S ALIVE?
WELL, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.
LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT, STEVEN.
OKAY?
ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION!
YOU'RE GONNA GET TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTER.
SHE'S IN THAT HOUSE, SHANNON, I KNOW IT.
- THEY'RE GONNA KILL US, NO MATTER WHAT.
- NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE GONNA GET THE MONEY.
THEY'LL GIVE US NINA BACK.
- THEY CAN BLINDFOLD US AND--
- NOBODY EVEN KNOWS THAT WE'RE HERE.
SHANNON, WE ARE GETTING OUT OF THIS.
YOU GO INTO THE BANK.
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING.
NO, BABY, NO.
NO, WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.
IT'S ONLY MONEY.
THEY'RE AFTER THE MONEY.
THEY'LL LET US GO.
SOMEBODY HELP US!
SOMEBODY!
SOMEBODY HELP US!
HELP!
SOMEBODY HELP US!
SOMEBODY!
THEY THINK YOU WANT TO KILL THEM.
NINA SHOWERED, READY FOR BED?
MM-HMM.
YOU WANT ME TO CHECK ON HER?
A LITTLE BIT TO THE LEFT.
LEFT, OVER HERE.
- HERE?
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
ANGIE.
Benjamin, I've got another job for you
- STARTING NEXT WEEK.
- OH, YEAH?
IT'S A WEST COAST COUPLE, SAN FRANCISCO,
ARRIVING SATURDAY.
GREAT.
Listen, Benny, um...
THIS JOB'S NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE WE'RE DOING NOW.
BUT I'M STILL CONFIDENT
WE'LL SEE ABOUT 15 OUT OF IT EACH.
- PRICE IS GOING DOWN?
- Well, just a little.
IT'S STILL WORTH IT.
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE
A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF THEM.
SO, I'LL SEE YOU in a few days with Nina, right?
- OF COURSE.
- Okay.
EVERYTHING OKAY?
Oh, Waldo.
Listen to the happy laughter of those friendly natives.
Then there's the one about the--
ALL RIGHT.
SHOWTIME.
THAT'S TODAY.
OKAY?
IT'S A BIG DAY.
WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE BANK.
WE'LL GET YOU THE MONEY.
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA COOPERATE
AND WE'RE GONNA GET YOU THE MONEY...
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA FORGET ALL ABOUT YOU.
MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.
PLEASE, JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND LET US GO.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I DON'T WANT ANY VIOLENCE.
WE GOOD?
WHEN YOU GET TO THE BANK,
SALO'S GONNA UNCUFF YOU,
THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
HE'S GONNA BE FOLLOWING YOU, BUT NOT LIKE HE KNOWS YOU.
IF YOU DO ANYTHING OR IF YOU TIP ANYBODY OFF,
LAST THING HE DOES BEFORE HE LEAVES THE BANK,
IS SHOOT YOU.
IF HE SHOOTS YOU, THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR MONEY,
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS, WE'RE SHOOTING YOU IN ANGER.
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,
WE DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU OR YOUR WIFE.
SO THAT'S IT, THAT'S THE PLAY.
IT'S UP TO YOU, MAN.
DON'T FUCK UP.
HEY, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE SOON.
YEAH?
AND WE'RE GONNA DO THE SAME THING WE DID BEFORE.
WE'RE GONNA PACK UP AND TRAVEL
AND MAYBE MEET ANOTHER FAMILY AND PLAY THE SAME GAME.OKAY?
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

Tonight, a country brought to its knees.
A 7.2 magnitude earthquake has hit Haiti.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, was literally torn apart.
The earthquake lasted all of a minute.
The intensity so strong, within seconds a cloud of dust covered the city.
And many people are still trapped in the rubble.
Some may still be alive, but getting out alive will be There's truly no way of knowing just how many people are dead.
Bodies are reportedly stacked in streets.
It's feared the number of people killed could now reach 200,000.
200,000 children without a mother or father even before this earthquake.
A country which only seems to know the worst of times is tonight just trying to survive.
-Mama!

I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, I PROMISE.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE.

THEY WOULDN'T LET ME JUST WALK OUT OF HERE ON MY OWN.
I HAD NO CHOICE.
IT'S THE WAY THEY DO THINGS HERE.
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?
NO, THE GUY DUMPED BEER ON ME.
IT WAS THE WEIRD PEOPLE FROM THE CABIN THAT WE KEEP RUNNING INTO.
THEY JUST TWISTED THE STORY ALL AROUND.

I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT TO YOUR OFFICERS.
YEAH, WELL, A NICE FAMILY LIKE YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT TYPE OF NONSENSE.
LIFE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT COMPLICATED.
THAT'S MY CARD IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
AND WHO MIGHT THIS LITTLEFLORECITA BE?
IT'S OUR DAUGHTER, NINA.

NINA, HONEY.
NINA, HONEY.
STEVEN!
SHE'S NOT UP HERE!
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE'S NOT HERE?
NINA!
HONEY?
NINA.
NINA!
HER SHOES ARE GONE!
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
SHE'S NOT HERE.
- NINA!
- NINA!
NINA!
- I'LL ASK RECEPTION.
- OKAY.
- NINA!
- NINA!
HI.
I'M LOOKING FOR MY DAUGHTER.
SHE WAS IN HER ROOM.
SHE'S BEEN MISSING-- I DON'T KNOW FOR HOW LONG.
- NINA!
- SHE'S SEVEN YEARS OLD,
SHE'S ABOUT THIS TALL.
-EXCUSEME ,SIR, CAN I HELP YOU?
YEAH, OUR DAUGHTER'S MISSING.
OKAY, HOW OLD IS SHE?
UH, SHE'S SEVEN, SHE'S HAITIAN.
MAYBE YOU SAW HER COME THROUGH THE LOBBY?
I'M SORRY.
- SHE WAS WEARING--
- SHE WAS WEARING, UH, PINK PAJAMA PANTS
- WITH POLKA DOTS AND A BLUE T-SHIRT.
- OKAY, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.
YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE ONES, THEY GO WHERE THEY WANT
AND SUDDENLY THEY TURN UP, SO...
- OH MY GOD, STEVEN!
- ...
NOT TO WORRY.
- SIR?
SIR?
- THE POOL!
- SHE'S IN THE POOL!
- SIR?
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
SOMEONE ON YOUR STAFF HAD TO SEE HER.
MR. MAYER, THERE'S CERTAIN PROTOCOL
THAT WE FOLLOW HERE, AND WE'RE DOING THAT.
GETTING ANGRY WITH THE STAFF?
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP.
- WHAT ABOUT SECURITY FOOTAGE?
- WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.
SHE CAN'T HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED.
CHILDREN DO WANDER OFF.
WHAT?
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD WITH A COMPLEX PAST,
BRAND NEW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES,
BEWILDERED, OVERWHELMED.
WE'RE LOOKING INTOnEVERY POSSIBILITY.
AND CONSIDERING THE CONFLICT THE OTHER NIGHT,
WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THAT.
CAN YOU MAKE A LIST OF OTHER PLACES YOU'VE BEEN
SINCE YOU ARRIVED AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MET?
AND ALSO, DO YOU HAVE ANY PHOTOS OF NINA?
I'LL GET MY COMPUTER.
IF SHE DID WANDER OFF ALONE,
SHE'S PROBABLY OUT THERE HUNGRY BY NOW.
SOMEONE HAS TO NOTICEnA LITTLE GIRL ALL ALONE.
WHAT ABOUT THE ADOPTION AGENCY?
- HOW WELL DID THEY KNOW HER?
- WE'VE BEEN CALLING THEM.
WE'RE WAITING FOR NINA'S PASSPORT TO COME THROUGH.
THEY DIDN'T ANSWER YESTERDAY.
I'M TRYING TO BRING UP HER PROFILE PICTURE ON THE WEBSITE, BUT...
THERE'S NO WEBSITE.
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THIS ADOPTION?
UH... $60,000.
EXCUSE ME.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.
I'M SORRY.
WE'VE BEEN PARENTS FOR 48 HOURS.
SHE COULDN'T HAVE WALKED OUT ON US, COULD SHE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN, SHE COULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO, RIGHT?
SHE SEEMED SO HAPPY.
ALL I EVER WANTED TO BE WAS A MOTHER.
PRETEND WITH MY LITTLE SISTER,
I'D...
BATHE HER AND FEED HER
AND TUCK HER IN AT NIGHT.
I SWORE THAT WHEN I HAD KIDS OF MY OWN
I WOULD NEVER ABANDON THEM
THE WAY THAT MY BIRTH MOTHER--
MOTHER ABANDONED ME.
SO WE HAVE TO FIND HER, OKAY?
WE WILL, OKAY?
WE WILL.
I JUST-- BECAUSE--
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, STEVEN,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
I'M GOING BACK TO THAT OFFICE.
YOU THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?
NO ONE'S ANSWERING THE PHONE,
THE WEBSITE'S DOWN.
I'M GONNA GO CONFRONT HER DIRECTLY.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LET THE COPS HANDLE THAT.
THE COPS DON'T CARE, SHANNON.
WE'RE TOURISTS.
THEY GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS OF THEIR OWN.
- JUST-
- JUST KEEP LOOKING.
- OKAY, GO.
I'LL KEEP LOOKING, OKAY.
WHAT THE FUCK?
NINA?
PERDON.
- YEAH.
- MRS. MAYER.
- YOU HAD SOME NEW INFO?
WELL, WE CONTACTED THE CONSULATE
AND YOUR PAPERWORK WAS NEVER PROCESSED.
NO GABRIELLE REIGERT
OR NINA DUVALIER.
THAT HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.
LET ME GUESS.
SHE TOLD YOU SHE WOULD CONTACT YOU
WHEN YOUR PASSPORT CAME IN,
SO ALL NINA HAD TO DO WAS WANDER OFF
AT THE APPOINTED TIME INTO HER WAITING ARMS.
NO, UM...
NO, OUR ROOM WAS LOCKED.
WE WOULD'VE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN.
THE SCAM IS CALLED RECLAIMING.
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT RARE.
WHAT THEY DO,
THEY GET AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN,
TAKE THE KID BACK,
ON TO THE NEXT VICTIM.
NEW WEB SITE, NEW CITY, NEW COUNTRY.
- IT'S VERY HARD TO TRACK.
IT'S ALL OVER ASIA NOW.
- THIS WEBSITE HAD, UM--
IT HAD ALL THESE, UH,
LINKS, AND IT HAD TESTIMONIALS.
WELL, WEBSITES WILL DO THAT.
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?
SIR, SIR...
NO, NO.
UH, JUST KEEP THAT.
THANK YOU.
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.
HE'S OUT LOOKING FOR HER.
YEAH, WE HEARD ABOUT A BREAK-IN IN OLD SAN JUAN.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.
WE DON'T NEED VIGILANTES.
WE'RE GONNA FIND THE GIRL.
COMANDANTE, THIS, UM--
THIS SCAM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT...
IT MIGHT BE TRUE...
BUT IT ALSO MIGHT NOT BE.
- SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING FOR HER.
- WE WILL KEEP LOOKING.
- YOU HAVE TO FIND HER.
- WE WILL.
SORRY, HAVE YOU SEEN THIS LITTLE GIRL?
SORRY, I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL.
ESTA NIÑA.
UM, HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
ESTA NIÑA.
CAN YOU-
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER?
THIS LITTLE GIRL,nHAVE YOU SEEN HER?
I DID A REALLY STUPID THING, SHANNON.
WE DID A STUPID THING.
NO, I DID.
YOU LOOKED SO HAPPY.
WE JUST FINISHED PAINTING HER ROOM.
EVERYTHING WAS SET.
AND THEN I GET AN EMAIL OUT OF NOWHERE
SAYING THE WHOLE THING FELL APART.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SHE SAID SHE COULD MAKE IT GO AWAY.
SHE-
- SHE SAID NO ONE WOULD KNOW...
SO I PAID HER.
WE'D ALREADY PAID.
I PAID HER MORE TO MAKE IT WORK.
HOW MUCH MORE?
ANOTHER 30.
FUCK.
FUCK, STEVEN.
STEVEN, YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU BOUGHT OUR DAUGHTER ON THE BLACK MARKET.
NO, NO.
NO.
SHE WAS AN OFFICIAL EXPEDITOR, SHANNON.
SHE HAD-- YOU SAW HER CREDENTIALS,
AND THAT OFFICE.
BABY, WE WERE SO CLOSE.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
WHAT ABOUT RUN IT BY ME?
COMMUNICATE?
I WANTED EVERYTHING TO WORK OUT.
AND SO WHAT?
YOU DECIDED THAT YOU WOULD
JUST TAKE SHORTCUTS AS USUAL?
WE WERE ON A WAITING LIST BACK HOME, REMEMBER?
ANOTHER TWO TO THREE MORE YEARS.
I WAS FINE TO WAIT.
OH, SURE, YOU WERE FINE TO WAIT.
IF YOU ALREADY PAID HER,
WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST NOT SHOW UP?
FUCK.
WHAT?
THERE WERE...
ADDITIONAL FEES...
THIS WEEK.
THE MONEY CAME THROUGH YESTERDAY.
- I GUESS SHE WAS WAITING...
- ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?
...AND THE PASSPORT STORY WAS THERE TO JUST STRING US ALONG.
MORE THAN THE 30?
NOT AS MUCH-- ANOTHER 10.
WE'RE NEVER GONNA SEE HER AGAIN.
MAYBE SHE WAS NEVER OURS.
- MAYBE NONE OF THIS WAS REAL.
- IT WAS REAL.
YOU FELT IT TOO, DIDN'T YOU?
YEAH, I THOUGHT I DID.
BUT...
IS SHE...
DOES SHE EVEN BELONG TO US, LEGALLY?
IF THIS IS A SCAM, IF THEY'RE CRIMINALS,
- DO WE EVEN STICK AROUND?
- SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL.
SHE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE
WITH GOD KNOWS WHAT KINDS OF PEOPLE.
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR DAUGHTER.
DOESN'T THAT MEAN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TRY?
OF COURSE IT DOES.

- I KNOW THAT.
...FOR WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT.
IT WAS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING,
I KNOW STEVEN DIDN'T PICK A FIGHT WITH YOU.HE'S SO PASSIVE, HE WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.
HE DIDN'T PICK A FIGHT WITH ME,
IT WAS MY BUDDY SALO, ANYWAY.
WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T DRINK.
LOOK, MY DAUGHTER'S MISSING, SO I DON'T--

- YEAH, I CALLED THE COPS.
- WHAT DID THEY SAY?
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?
- WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
HOW DO YOU NOT TELL ME ABOUT SOMETHING THAT BIG--
SHANNON, I KNEW IF I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE MONEY YOU WOULD'VE JUST--
IF YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE MONEY,
I WOULD'VE SAID IT WAS A BAD IDEA.
YEAH, OKAY, WELL, I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING A GOOD DECISION FOR US.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT DOING SOMETHING GOOD.
IT'S ABOUT YOUR COMPLETE LACK OF JUDGMENT.
THANKS.
A MARRIAGE IS A PARTNERSHIP, OKAY?
YOU NEVER TALK TO ME!
WE ARE STILL GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS.
I KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
- I'M CALLING THE POLICE.
- WAIT.
BENJAMIN HAS HER.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I CAN TAKE YOU TO HER.
WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU?
WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER OPTION.
IS SHE OKAY?
SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S JUST SCARED.
- WHY ARE YOU HELPING US?
- YEAH.
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.
SAY A FUCKING WORD I'M GONNA BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF, OKAY?

WHAT DID YOU DO WITH NINA?
SHE'S FINE, REALLY.
NINA'S FINE, NO PROBLEM.
PLEASE, JUST TELL US WHAT YOU WANT.
nail IN GOOD TIME.
SO YOU GOT SOMEBODY IN CHICAGO
THAT LOOKS AFTER YOUR MONEY?
- OUR MONEY?
- YEAH.
SHANNON, YOU COME FROM MONEY.
AND YOU HAD A BIGnFUCKING PILE OF IT
EVEN BEFOREnTHE ACCIDENT, RIGHT?
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.
REALLY?
$2.9 MILLION SETTLEMENT?
THINK I'M A FUCKING MORON?
AUGUST 12th, 2010, "CHICAGO SUN TIMES,"
"CHICAGO WOMAN RECEIVESCIVIL SETTLEMENTnIN CITY TRAGEDY.
LATE AFTERNOONnIT WAS RULED
THAT THE COOKE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKSWAS AT FAULT WHEN A WASTE DISPOSAL TRUCK
COLLIDED WITH SHANNON MAYER, 27, OF OAK PARK..."
PLEASE, STOP IT.
- "...
CLAIMING THE LIFE OF HER UNBORN DAUGHTER."
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
- AND YOU LOST THE ABILITY TO BEAR MORE CHILDREN.
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU HAVE MONEY.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT?
I MEAN, YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS THE EXTRAVAGANT TYPE.
WE-
- WE BOUGHT A HOUSE.
WE, UM-
- WE REBUILT A LIFE.
WE STARTEDnA CHARITABLE TRUST.
- WE ADOPTED NINA.
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID?
YOU INVESTED.
- RIGHT?
- HE'S A TOY DESIGNER.
WE DON'T REALLYnMAKE THAT MUCH,
AND I HAVEN'T WORKEDnSINCE THE ACCIDENT.
WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS DO YOU MAKE?
ALL RIGHT, YOU DIDN'T WORK AFTER THE ACCIDENT?
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN, THERE'S NOTHING THERE.
STEVEN...
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A SMART GUY.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON HERE.
YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN, GABRIELLE REIGERT?
THAT'S NOT HER REAL NAME.
HER REAL NAME IS ANGIE.
SO THIS FUNNY, LITTLE WOMAN
COMES UP TO ME IN SOME SHIT-HOLE,
BUSINESS-CLASS AIRPORT LOUNGE
AND SAYS, "COME DO THIS THING."
"WHO IS THIS WOMAN?" I'M THINKING.
"WHAT IS SHE, FUCKING INTEL?
WHAT IS SHE, BLACKWATER?
CHRISTIAN OUTREACH?"
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.
SHE SAYS, "I PAY CASH.
$25,000 A POP."
SO TO BE FAIR TO YOU,
IT'S NOT JUST YOU AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS
THAT I DON'T ALTOGETHER TRUST.
LIKE MAYBE SHE BURNED ME A LITTLE BIT.
AND AFTER YOUR WIFE AND I HAD A LITTLE GET TOGETHER IN TOWN--
NOTHING UNTOWARD, BROTHER, NOTHING UNTOWARD--
WELL, I DECIDED WE HAD TO CHECK OUT A FEW THINGS.
SEE, USUALLY WE JUST TAKE THE KID
AND YOU LEAVE THE ISLAND BURNING IN SHAME.
BUT NECESSITY BRINGS US TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME.
AND WHILE WE'RE HERE, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS OTHER THING
BECAUSE THIS IS, AFTER ALL, WHAT WE DO FOR A LIVING.
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
I DON'T THINK I AM, STEVEN.
OKAY, WE WANT TO DO BANK OF AMERICA OR CITIBANK?
BANK OF AMERICA?
OKAY, STEVEN, NOW WE NEED THE PASSCODE,
SO IT'LL ALL GO A LOT EASIER IF YOU JUST GIVE IT TO ME.
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR FUCKING TIME.
ALL RIGHT, NOW I THINK YOU'RE LYING TO ME.
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S LYING TO ME.
BUT I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING, I'M SICK OF BEING LIED TO.
SO LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE STAKES ARE.
THOSE ARE THE STAKES!
- WE'LL BLOW HER FUCKING BRAINS OUT!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- BLOW HER BRAINS OUT NEXT!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- TELL HIM THE FUCKING PASSWORD!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- THE PASSWORD!
SHIT.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
OKAY!
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?
7-1-2 7-3-5.
IS THAT IT?
- HOLD ON, JUST--
- LET GO OF HER.
- LET GO OF HER.
- LET HER GO!
- SHUT THE FUCK UP!
- HEY, HEY, COME ON NOW.
- YOU PIECE OF SHIT.
- SHUT THE FUCK UP, MOTHER FUCKER.
HEY, CALM DOWN.
EVERYBODY TAKE A DEEP BREATH, OKAY?
BABY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO DRUNK THAT NIGHT.
IF I WASN'T AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME GET ME,
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED.
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.
I KNOW I CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST.
- GOD KNOWS I WISH I COULD.
- BABY, THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.
BUT I CAN GET US OUT OF THIS, I PROMISE YOU.
I PROMISE.
GOOD MORNING.
SO, LISTEN...
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM JERRY,

UH, WHAT'S HIS NAME, ROSENBERG SOMETHING?
ANYWAY, HE EMAILED,
THE TRANSFER'S GONNA TAKE 48 HOURS.
SO TODAY IS GONNA BE KIND OF A LAY-AROUND DAY,
YOU KNOW, NOTHING TO DO.
LOOK, I'M NOT A MONSTER OR ANYTHING,
AND I'LL BRING YOU SOME FOOD AND WATER.
AND MAYBE YOU CAN EVEN TAKE A SHOWER OR SOMETHING.
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF?
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS THAT?
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF?
YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S ROUGH, SHANNON,
BUT, JUST-- I DO WHAT I CAN.
WHAT HAPPENS TO NINA?
YOU CAN HAVE HER WHEN THIS IS ALL DONE.
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE KID.
IF THINGS GO SMOOTH, THE KID'S YOURS.
HOW DO WE KNOW SHE'S ALIVE?
WELL, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.
LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT, STEVEN.
OKAY?
ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION!
YOU'RE GONNA GET TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTER.
SHE'S IN THAT HOUSE, SHANNON, I KNOW IT.
- THEY'RE GONNA KILL US, NO MATTER WHAT.
- NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE GONNA GET THE MONEY.
THEY'LL GIVE US NINA BACK.
- THEY CAN BLINDFOLD US AND--
- NOBODY EVEN KNOWS THAT WE'RE HERE.
SHANNON, WE ARE GETTING OUT OF THIS.
YOU GO INTO THE BANK.
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING.
NO, BABY, NO.
NO, WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.
IT'S ONLY MONEY.
THEY'RE AFTER THE MONEY.
THEY'LL LET US GO.
SOMEBODY HELP US!
SOMEBODY!
SOMEBODY HELP US!

THEY THINK YOU WANT TO KILL THEM.
NINA SHOWERED, READY FOR BED?

Listen, Benny, um...
THIS JOB'S NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE WE'RE DOING NOW.
BUT I'M STILL CONFIDENT
WE'LL SEE ABOUT 15 OUT OF IT EACH.
- PRICE IS GOING DOWN?
- Well, just a little.
IT'S STILL WORTH IT.
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE
A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF THEM.
SO, I'LL SEE YOU in a few days with Nina, right?
- OF COURSE.
- Okay.
EVERYTHING OKAY?
Oh, Waldo.
Listen to the happy laughter of those friendly natives.

PLEASE, JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND LET US GO.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I DON'T WANT ANY VIOLENCE.
WE GOOD?
WHEN YOU GET TO THE BANK,
SALO'S GONNA UNCUFF YOU,
THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
HE'S GONNA BE FOLLOWING YOU, BUT NOT LIKE HE KNOWS YOU.
IF YOU DO ANYTHING OR IF YOU TIP ANYBODY OFF,
LAST THING HE DOES BEFORE HE LEAVES THE BANK,
IS SHOOT YOU.
IF HE SHOOTS YOU, THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR MONEY,
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS, WE'RE SHOOTING YOU IN ANGER.
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,
WE DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU OR YOUR WIFE.
SO THAT'S IT, THAT'S THE PLAY.
IT'S UP TO YOU, MAN.
DON'T FUCK UP.
HEY, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE SOON.
YEAH?
AND WE'RE GONNA DO THE SAME THING WE DID BEFORE.
WE'RE GONNA PACK UP AND TRAVEL

A 7.2 magnitude earthquake has hit Haiti.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, was literally torn apart.
The earthquake lasted all of a minute.
The intensity so strong, within seconds a cloud of dust covered the city.
And many people are still trapped in the rubble.
Some may still be alive, but getting out alive will be There's truly no way of knowing just how many people are dead.
Bodies are reportedly stacked in streets.
It's feared the number of people killed could now reach 200,000.

THERE'S ETIQUETTES EVERYWHERE.
IS IT EXPENSIVE?
- WHAT'S THAT?
- WELL, THE WHOLE PROCESS.
YOU KNOW, CUTTING THROUGH ALL THE RED TAPE.
UM, I SUPPOSE IF ONE DOES,
BUT WE WENT A MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD ROUTE.
NO, I MEAN, IS IT HARD--
LIKE, DO YOU HAVE TO NEED AN EXPEDITOR
OR DO THEY BILK YOU FOR MORE AND MORE MONEY
OR ANYTHING?
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I-- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT.THE WAITING IS DIFFICULT.
YOU KNOW, BUT...
- THERE IT IS.

- WE'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?
- SHANNON, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
- HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, I PROMISE.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE.
YOU CALL ME FROM A POLICE STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME JUST WALK OUT OF HERE ON MY OWN.
I HAD NO CHOICE.
IT'S THE WAY THEY DO THINGS HERE.
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?
NO, THE GUY DUMPED BEER ON ME.
IT WAS THE WEIRD PEOPLE FROM THE CABIN THAT WE KEEP RUNNING INTO.
THEY JUST TWISTED THE STORY ALL AROUND.
SIR.
SIGN HERE, WILL YOU PLEASE?
IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?
ARE WE REALLY BACK HERE?
I DIDN'T DO--
NINA, UM...
OUI.
NINA, I'M SORRY
MOMMY HAD TO WAKE YOU UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.
YEAH?
HELLO.
HEARD IT WAS THE WILD, WILD WEST OUT THERE, HUH?
IT WAS, UM, A MISUNDERSTANDING.
YEAH, YOU HAD A RUN-IN WITH SOME TROUBLEMAKERS, I UNDERSTAND?
YES, ACTUALLY, I DID.
I WAS ATTACKED FOR NO REASON.
I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT TO YOUR OFFICERS.
YEAH, WELL, A NICE FAMILY LIKE YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT TYPE OF NONSENSE.
LIFE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT COMPLICATED.
THAT'S MY CARD IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
AND WHO MIGHT THIS LITTLEFLORECITA BE?
IT'S OUR DAUGHTER, NINA.
LOVELY.
WELL, LOOK, WE REALLY LOVE TOURISTS HERE,
SO PLEASE ENJOY YOURSELVES.
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR-- STAY OUT OF BARS FOR AWHILE, OKAY?
YES, SIR.
YOU UP?
YEAH.
BABY, I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I...
WHAT I REALLY THINK WOULD MAKE
EVERYTHING BETTER?
WHAT?
PANCAKES.
OKAY.
- THAT'S EASY.
- I'M THE WORLD'S CHEAPEST DATE.
YOU ORDER PANCAKES, I'LL SEE IF NINA'S AWAKE.
OKAY.
NINA, HONEY.
NINA, HONEY.
STEVEN!
SHE'S NOT UP HERE!
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE'S NOT HERE?
NINA!
HONEY?
NINA.
NINA!
HER SHOES ARE GONE!
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
SHE'S NOT HERE.
- NINA!
- NINA!
NINA!
- I'LL ASK RECEPTION.
- OKAY.
- NINA!
- NINA!
HI.
I'M LOOKING FOR MY DAUGHTER.
SHE WAS IN HER ROOM.
SHE'S BEEN MISSING-- I DON'T KNOW FOR HOW LONG.
- NINA!
- SHE'S SEVEN YEARS OLD,
SHE'S ABOUT THIS TALL.
-EXCUSEME ,SIR, CAN I HELP YOU?
YEAH, OUR DAUGHTER'S MISSING.
OKAY, HOW OLD IS SHE?
UH, SHE'S SEVEN, SHE'S HAITIAN.
MAYBE YOU SAW HER COME THROUGH THE LOBBY?
I'M SORRY.
- SHE WAS WEARING--
- SHE WAS WEARING, UH, PINK PAJAMA PANTS
- WITH POLKA DOTS AND A BLUE T-SHIRT.
- OKAY, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN.
YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE ONES, THEY GO WHERE THEY WANT
AND SUDDENLY THEY TURN UP, SO...
- OH MY GOD, STEVEN!
- ...
NOT TO WORRY.
- SIR?
SIR?
- THE POOL!
- SHE'S IN THE POOL!
- SIR?
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
SOMEONE ON YOUR STAFF HAD TO SEE HER.
MR. MAYER, THERE'S CERTAIN PROTOCOL
THAT WE FOLLOW HERE, AND WE'RE DOING THAT.
GETTING ANGRY WITH THE STAFF?
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP.
- WHAT ABOUT SECURITY FOOTAGE?
- WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT.
SHE CAN'T HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED.
CHILDREN DO WANDER OFF.
WHAT?
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD WITH A COMPLEX PAST,
BRAND NEW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES,
BEWILDERED, OVERWHELMED.
WE'RE LOOKING INTOnEVERY POSSIBILITY.
AND CONSIDERING THE CONFLICT THE OTHER NIGHT,
WE HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THAT.
CAN YOU MAKE A LIST OF OTHER PLACES YOU'VE BEEN
SINCE YOU ARRIVED AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MET?
AND ALSO, DO YOU HAVE ANY PHOTOS OF NINA?
I'LL GET MY COMPUTER.
IF SHE DID WANDER OFF ALONE,
SHE'S PROBABLY OUT THERE HUNGRY BY NOW.
SOMEONE HAS TO NOTICEnA LITTLE GIRL ALL ALONE.
WHAT ABOUT THE ADOPTION AGENCY?
- HOW WELL DID THEY KNOW HER?
- WE'VE BEEN CALLING THEM.
WE'RE WAITING FOR NINA'S PASSPORT TO COME THROUGH.
THEY DIDN'T ANSWER YESTERDAY.
I'M TRYING TO BRING UP HER PROFILE PICTURE ON THE WEBSITE, BUT...
THERE'S NO WEBSITE.
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THIS ADOPTION?
UH... $60,000.
EXCUSE ME.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.
I'M SORRY.
WE'VE BEEN PARENTS FOR 48 HOURS.
SHE COULDN'T HAVE WALKED OUT ON US, COULD SHE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN, SHE COULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO, RIGHT?
SHE SEEMED SO HAPPY.
ALL I EVER WANTED TO BE WAS A MOTHER.
PRETEND WITH MY LITTLE SISTER,
I'D...
BATHE HER AND FEED HER
AND TUCK HER IN AT NIGHT.
I SWORE THAT WHEN I HAD KIDS OF MY OWN
I WOULD NEVER ABANDON THEM
THE WAY THAT MY BIRTH MOTHER--
MOTHER ABANDONED ME.
SO WE HAVE TO FIND HER, OKAY?
WE WILL, OKAY?
WE WILL.
I JUST-- BECAUSE--
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, STEVEN,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
I'M GOING BACK TO THAT OFFICE.
YOU THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?
NO ONE'S ANSWERING THE PHONE,
THE WEBSITE'S DOWN.
I'M GONNA GO CONFRONT HER DIRECTLY.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LET THE COPS HANDLE THAT.
THE COPS DON'T CARE, SHANNON.
WE'RE TOURISTS.
THEY GOT ENOUGH PROBLEMS OF THEIR OWN.
- JUST-
- JUST KEEP LOOKING.
- OKAY, GO.
I'LL KEEP LOOKING, OKAY.
WHAT THE FUCK?
NINA?
PERDON.
- YEAH.
- MRS. MAYER.
- YOU HAD SOME NEW INFO?
WELL, WE CONTACTED THE CONSULATE
AND YOUR PAPERWORK WAS NEVER PROCESSED.
NO GABRIELLE REIGERT
OR NINA DUVALIER.
THAT HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.
LET ME GUESS.
SHE TOLD YOU SHE WOULD CONTACT YOU
WHEN YOUR PASSPORT CAME IN,
SO ALL NINA HAD TO DO WAS WANDER OFF
AT THE APPOINTED TIME INTO HER WAITING ARMS.
NO, UM...
NO, OUR ROOM WAS LOCKED.
WE WOULD'VE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN.
THE SCAM IS CALLED RECLAIMING.
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT RARE.
WHAT THEY DO,
THEY GET AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN,
TAKE THE KID BACK,
ON TO THE NEXT VICTIM.
NEW WEB SITE, NEW CITY, NEW COUNTRY.
- IT'S VERY HARD TO TRACK.
IT'S ALL OVER ASIA NOW.
- THIS WEBSITE HAD, UM--
IT HAD ALL THESE, UH,
LINKS, AND IT HAD TESTIMONIALS.
WELL, WEBSITES WILL DO THAT.
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?
SIR, SIR...
NO, NO.
UH, JUST KEEP THAT.
THANK YOU.
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.
HE'S OUT LOOKING FOR HER.
YEAH, WE HEARD ABOUT A BREAK-IN IN OLD SAN JUAN.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.
WE DON'T NEED VIGILANTES.
WE'RE GONNA FIND THE GIRL.
COMANDANTE, THIS, UM--
THIS SCAM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT...
IT MIGHT BE TRUE...
BUT IT ALSO MIGHT NOT BE.
- SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING FOR HER.
- WE WILL KEEP LOOKING.
- YOU HAVE TO FIND HER.
- WE WILL.
SORRY, HAVE YOU SEEN THIS LITTLE GIRL?
SORRY, I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL.
ESTA NIÑA.
UM, HAVE YOU SEEN HER?
ESTA NIÑA.
CAN YOU-
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER?
THIS LITTLE GIRL,nHAVE YOU SEEN HER?
I DID A REALLY STUPID THING, SHANNON.
WE DID A STUPID THING.
NO, I DID.
YOU LOOKED SO HAPPY.
WE JUST FINISHED PAINTING HER ROOM.
EVERYTHING WAS SET.
AND THEN I GET AN EMAIL OUT OF NOWHERE
SAYING THE WHOLE THING FELL APART.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SHE SAID SHE COULD MAKE IT GO AWAY.
SHE-
- SHE SAID NO ONE WOULD KNOW...
SO I PAID HER.
WE'D ALREADY PAID.
I PAID HER MORE TO MAKE IT WORK.
HOW MUCH MORE?
ANOTHER 30.
FUCK.
FUCK, STEVEN.
STEVEN, YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU BOUGHT OUR DAUGHTER ON THE BLACK MARKET.
NO, NO.
NO.
SHE WAS AN OFFICIAL EXPEDITOR, SHANNON.
SHE HAD-- YOU SAW HER CREDENTIALS,
AND THAT OFFICE.
BABY, WE WERE SO CLOSE.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
WHAT ABOUT RUN IT BY ME?
COMMUNICATE?
I WANTED EVERYTHING TO WORK OUT.
AND SO WHAT?
YOU DECIDED THAT YOU WOULD
JUST TAKE SHORTCUTS AS USUAL?
WE WERE ON A WAITING LIST BACK HOME, REMEMBER?
ANOTHER TWO TO THREE MORE YEARS.
I WAS FINE TO WAIT.
OH, SURE, YOU WERE FINE TO WAIT.
IF YOU ALREADY PAID HER,
WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST NOT SHOW UP?
FUCK.
WHAT?
THERE WERE...
ADDITIONAL FEES...
THIS WEEK.
THE MONEY CAME THROUGH YESTERDAY.
- I GUESS SHE WAS WAITING...
- ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?
...AND THE PASSPORT STORY WAS THERE TO JUST STRING US ALONG.
MORE THAN THE 30?
NOT AS MUCH-- ANOTHER 10.
WE'RE NEVER GONNA SEE HER AGAIN.
MAYBE SHE WAS NEVER OURS.
- MAYBE NONE OF THIS WAS REAL.
- IT WAS REAL.
YOU FELT IT TOO, DIDN'T YOU?
YEAH, I THOUGHT I DID.
BUT...
IS SHE...
DOES SHE EVEN BELONG TO US, LEGALLY?
IF THIS IS A SCAM, IF THEY'RE CRIMINALS,
- DO WE EVEN STICK AROUND?
- SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL.
SHE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE
WITH GOD KNOWS WHAT KINDS OF PEOPLE.
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR DAUGHTER.
DOESN'T THAT MEAN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TRY?
OF COURSE IT DOES.
YES.
LET'S-- LET'S DRIVE AROUND SOME MORE.
I JUST-- I NEED SOME TIME, OKAY?
YOU DRIVE AROUND.
SHIT.
- HEY, SHANNON.
- SHANNON?
IT'S BENJAMIN AND VERONICA.
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY WE'RE REALLY SORRY...
- I KNOW THAT.
...FOR WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT.
IT WAS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING,
I KNOW STEVEN DIDN'T PICK A FIGHT WITH YOU.HE'S SO PASSIVE, HE WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.
HE DIDN'T PICK A FIGHT WITH ME,
IT WAS MY BUDDY SALO, ANYWAY.
WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T DRINK.
LOOK, MY DAUGHTER'S MISSING, SO I DON'T--
CAN WE JUST NOT?
YOU'RE DAUGHTER'S MISSING?
WHERE IS SHE?
YEAH, IT'S ALL-- IT'S ALL PART OF SOME SCAM.
A SCAM?
YEAH, THESE PEOPLE, THEY JUST-
- THEY, UM...
THEY GIVE YOU A LITTLE GIRL,
THEY GET A 100 GRAND FROM YOU...
AND THEN THEY TAKE HER BACK.
100 GRAND?
OH MY GOD.
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- DID YOU TALK TO THE POLICE?
- YEAH, I CALLED THE COPS.
- WHAT DID THEY SAY?
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?
- WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
HOW DO YOU NOT TELL ME ABOUT SOMETHING THAT BIG--
SHANNON, I KNEW IF I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE MONEY YOU WOULD'VE JUST--
IF YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE MONEY,
I WOULD'VE SAID IT WAS A BAD IDEA.
YEAH, OKAY, WELL, I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING A GOOD DECISION FOR US.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT DOING SOMETHING GOOD.
IT'S ABOUT YOUR COMPLETE LACK OF JUDGMENT.
THANKS.
A MARRIAGE IS A PARTNERSHIP, OKAY?
YOU NEVER TALK TO ME!
WE ARE STILL GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS.
I KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
- I'M CALLING THE POLICE.
- WAIT.
BENJAMIN HAS HER.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I CAN TAKE YOU TO HER.
WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU?
WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER OPTION.
IS SHE OKAY?
SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S JUST SCARED.
- WHY ARE YOU HELPING US?
- YEAH.
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.
SAY A FUCKING WORD I'M GONNA BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF, OKAY?
- GO TO THE WALL.
PUT YOUR HANDS UP ON THE WALL.
AGAINST THE WALL NOW!
HANDS DOWN.
SHH.
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.
GET THE TAPE.
BE QUIET.
THANK YOU.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, STAY THERE.
WALLET?
ALL RIGHT.
HOTEL ROOM KEY.
CHECK THEM OUT,
YOU DRIVE THEIR RENTAL CAR.
SEE YOU THERE.
LET'S MOVE.
FEET UP.
WELCOME TO YOUR PUERTO RICAN VACATIONS, MOTHERFUCKERS.
GET THE FUCK OUT!
HURRY UP!
MOVE.
MOVE.
MOVE, YOU FUCKING GRINGO.
MOVE, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!
SIT DOWN.
SIT THE FUCK DOWN!
SIT THE FUCK DOWN!
MOTHERFUCKER, I WILL SHOOT YOUR FUCKING BRAINS OUT.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH NINA?
SHE'S FINE, REALLY.
NINA'S FINE, NO PROBLEM.
PLEASE, JUST TELL US WHAT YOU WANT.
nail IN GOOD TIME.
SO YOU GOT SOMEBODY IN CHICAGO
THAT LOOKS AFTER YOUR MONEY?
- OUR MONEY?
- YEAH.
SHANNON, YOU COME FROM MONEY.
AND YOU HAD A BIGnFUCKING PILE OF IT
EVEN BEFOREnTHE ACCIDENT, RIGHT?
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.
REALLY?
$2.9 MILLION SETTLEMENT?
THINK I'M A FUCKING MORON?
AUGUST 12th, 2010, "CHICAGO SUN TIMES,"
"CHICAGO WOMAN RECEIVESCIVIL SETTLEMENTnIN CITY TRAGEDY.
LATE AFTERNOONnIT WAS RULED
THAT THE COOKE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKSWAS AT FAULT WHEN A WASTE DISPOSAL TRUCK
COLLIDED WITH SHANNON MAYER, 27, OF OAK PARK..."
PLEASE, STOP IT.
- "...
CLAIMING THE LIFE OF HER UNBORN DAUGHTER."
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
- AND YOU LOST THE ABILITY TO BEAR MORE CHILDREN.
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU HAVE MONEY.
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT?
I MEAN, YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS THE EXTRAVAGANT TYPE.
WE-
- WE BOUGHT A HOUSE.
WE, UM-
- WE REBUILT A LIFE.
WE STARTEDnA CHARITABLE TRUST.
- WE ADOPTED NINA.
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID?
YOU INVESTED.
- RIGHT?
- HE'S A TOY DESIGNER.
WE DON'T REALLYnMAKE THAT MUCH,
AND I HAVEN'T WORKEDnSINCE THE ACCIDENT.
WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS DO YOU MAKE?
ALL RIGHT, YOU DIDN'T WORK AFTER THE ACCIDENT?
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN, THERE'S NOTHING THERE.
STEVEN...
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A SMART GUY.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON HERE.
YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN, GABRIELLE REIGERT?
THAT'S NOT HER REAL NAME.
HER REAL NAME IS ANGIE.
SO THIS FUNNY, LITTLE WOMAN
COMES UP TO ME IN SOME SHIT-HOLE,
BUSINESS-CLASS AIRPORT LOUNGE
AND SAYS, "COME DO THIS THING."
"WHO IS THIS WOMAN?" I'M THINKING.
"WHAT IS SHE, FUCKING INTEL?
WHAT IS SHE, BLACKWATER?
CHRISTIAN OUTREACH?"
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK.
SHE SAYS, "I PAY CASH.
$25,000 A POP."
SO TO BE FAIR TO YOU,
IT'S NOT JUST YOU AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS
THAT I DON'T ALTOGETHER TRUST.
LIKE MAYBE SHE BURNED ME A LITTLE BIT.
AND AFTER YOUR WIFE AND I HAD A LITTLE GET TOGETHER IN TOWN--
NOTHING UNTOWARD, BROTHER, NOTHING UNTOWARD--
WELL, I DECIDED WE HAD TO CHECK OUT A FEW THINGS.
SEE, USUALLY WE JUST TAKE THE KID
AND YOU LEAVE THE ISLAND BURNING IN SHAME.
BUT NECESSITY BRINGS US TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME.
AND WHILE WE'RE HERE, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS OTHER THING
BECAUSE THIS IS, AFTER ALL, WHAT WE DO FOR A LIVING.
- YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
I DON'T THINK I AM, STEVEN.
OKAY, WE WANT TO DO BANK OF AMERICA OR CITIBANK?
BANK OF AMERICA?
OKAY, STEVEN, NOW WE NEED THE PASSCODE,
SO IT'LL ALL GO A LOT EASIER IF YOU JUST GIVE IT TO ME.
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR FUCKING TIME.
ALL RIGHT, NOW I THINK YOU'RE LYING TO ME.
AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S LYING TO ME.
BUT I'M TELLING YOU SOMETHING, I'M SICK OF BEING LIED TO.
SO LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE STAKES ARE.
THOSE ARE THE STAKES!
- WE'LL BLOW HER FUCKING BRAINS OUT!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- BLOW HER BRAINS OUT NEXT!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- TELL HIM THE FUCKING PASSWORD!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
- THE PASSWORD!
SHIT.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
OKAY!
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?
7-1-2 7-3-5.
IS THAT IT?
- HOLD ON, JUST--
- LET GO OF HER.
- LET GO OF HER.
- LET HER GO!
- SHUT THE FUCK UP!
- HEY, HEY, COME ON NOW.
- YOU PIECE OF SHIT.
- SHUT THE FUCK UP, MOTHER FUCKER.
HEY, CALM DOWN.
EVERYBODY TAKE A DEEP BREATH, OKAY?
BABY, I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO DRUNK THAT NIGHT.
IF I WASN'T AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME GET ME,
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED.
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.
I KNOW I CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST.
- GOD KNOWS I WISH I COULD.
- BABY, THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.
BUT I CAN GET US OUT OF THIS, I PROMISE YOU.
I PROMISE.
GOOD MORNING.
SO, LISTEN...
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM JERRY,
YOUR MAN IN CHICAGO.
UH, WHAT'S HIS NAME, ROSENBERG SOMETHING?
ANYWAY, HE EMAILED,
THE TRANSFER'S GONNA TAKE 48 HOURS.
SO TODAY IS GONNA BE KIND OF A LAY-AROUND DAY,
YOU KNOW, NOTHING TO DO.
LOOK, I'M NOT A MONSTER OR ANYTHING,
AND I'LL BRING YOU SOME FOOD AND WATER.
AND MAYBE YOU CAN EVEN TAKE A SHOWER OR SOMETHING.
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF?
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS THAT?
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF?
YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S ROUGH, SHANNON,
BUT, JUST-- I DO WHAT I CAN.
WHAT HAPPENS TO NINA?
YOU CAN HAVE HER WHEN THIS IS ALL DONE.
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE KID.
IF THINGS GO SMOOTH, THE KID'S YOURS.
HOW DO WE KNOW SHE'S ALIVE?
WELL, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION.
LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT, STEVEN.
OKAY?
ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION!
YOU'RE GONNA GET TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTER.
SHE'S IN THAT HOUSE, SHANNON, I KNOW IT.
- THEY'RE GONNA KILL US, NO MATTER WHAT.
- NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE GONNA GET THE MONEY.
THEY'LL GIVE US NINA BACK.
- THEY CAN BLINDFOLD US AND--
- NOBODY EVEN KNOWS THAT WE'RE HERE.
SHANNON, WE ARE GETTING OUT OF THIS.
YOU GO INTO THE BANK.
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING.
NO, BABY, NO.
NO, WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.
IT'S ONLY MONEY.
THEY'RE AFTER THE MONEY.
THEY'LL LET US GO.
SOMEBODY HELP US!
SOMEBODY!
SOMEBODY HELP US!
HELP!
SOMEBODY HELP US!
SOMEBODY!
THEY THINK YOU WANT TO KILL THEM.
NINA SHOWERED, READY FOR BED?
MM-HMM.
YOU WANT ME TO CHECK ON HER?
A LITTLE BIT TO THE LEFT.
LEFT, OVER HERE.
- HERE?
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
ANGIE.
Benjamin, I've got another job for you
- STARTING NEXT WEEK.
- OH, YEAH?
IT'S A WEST COAST COUPLE, SAN FRANCISCO,
ARRIVING SATURDAY.
GREAT.
Listen, Benny, um...
THIS JOB'S NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE WE'RE DOING NOW.
BUT I'M STILL CONFIDENT
WE'LL SEE ABOUT 15 OUT OF IT EACH.
- PRICE IS GOING DOWN?
- Well, just a little.
IT'S STILL WORTH IT.
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE
A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF THEM.
SO, I'LL SEE YOU in a few days with Nina, right?
- OF COURSE.
- Okay.
EVERYTHING OKAY?
Oh, Waldo.
Listen to the happy laughter of those friendly natives.

IT'S A BIG DAY.
WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE BANK.

MM-HMM.

PLEASE, JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND LET US GO.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I DON'T WANT ANY VIOLENCE.
WE GOOD?
WHEN YOU GET TO THE BANK,
SALO'S GONNA UNCUFF YOU,
THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
HE'S GONNA BE FOLLOWING YOU, BUT NOT LIKE HE KNOWS YOU.
IF YOU DO ANYTHING OR IF YOU TIP ANYBODY OFF,
LAST THING HE DOES BEFORE HE LEAVES THE BANK,
IS SHOOT YOU.
IF HE SHOOTS YOU, THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR MONEY,
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS, WE'RE SHOOTING YOU IN ANGER.
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,
WE DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU OR YOUR WIFE.
SO THAT'S IT, THAT'S THE PLAY.
IT'S UP TO YOU, MAN.
DON'T FUCK UP.
HEY, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE SOON.
YEAH?
AND WE'RE GONNA DO THE SAME THING WE DID BEFORE.
WE'RE GONNA PACK UP AND TRAVEL
AND MAYBE MEET ANOTHER FAMILY AND PLAY THE SAME GAME.OKAY?

Tonight, a country brought to its knees.
A 7.2 magnitude earthquake has hit Haiti.
The capital, port-au-prince, was literally torn apart.
The earthquake lasted all of a minute.
The intensity so strong, within seconds a cloud of dust covered the city.
And many people are still trapped in the rubble.
Some may still be alive, but getting out alive will be there's truly no way of knowing just how many people are dead.
Bodies are reportedly stacked in streets.
It's feared the number of people killed could now reach 200,000.
200,000 children without a mother or Father even before this earthquake.
A country which only seems to know the worst of times is tonight just trying to survive.
- Mama!
Mama!
But it is the human losses which are most shocking.
Mama!
Mama!
"My name is Nina.
I am seven years old."
I can't believe we're finally here.
Are you nervous?
Yeah.
You?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm excited... we got to be close, right?
I hope so.
Hello, hello, I'm Gabrielle.
- Hi.
- Mrs. Reigert, nice to meet you finally.
- Steven.
- Shannon.
- Shannon, how are you?
- Excited.
I don't think I've slept in a couple of days.
But we made it and we're here.
Well, let's delay no longer.
Um, actually, I'm gonna tip our driver.
Oh, no, no, that's all taken care of.
The car will wait for you.
Come on.
- Great.
- Okay.
All I need is one more week to secure her passport, but all the Haitian and Puerto Rican documents are signed and sealed officially.
Excellent.
This is my office.
My assistant Maryanne.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Please make yourselves comfortable.
I'll just go and get the little one.
All right.
Nina.
Do you realize when she comes back, we're parents?
It's...
- I'm gonna take a picture.
- Okay, of course you are.
Okay, this way.
Hi.
I'm Shannon.
Bonjour.
Bonjour.
- Merci.
- Bonjour, Nina.
Bonjour.
Do you remember this guy?
I showed you on the computer?
Boy, oh boy.
We've been getting to know each other.
Haven't we, ma petite?
I believe congratulations are in order.
Okay, squeeze up.
Smile.
All you have to do now is have fun, relax, get to know Nina.
And if I can, I'll come down on Sunday just to see how she's settling in.
Oh, I don't know that that's necessary.
In fact, you know, maybe it's better
- if we just spend some time...
- No, no.
They get separation anxiety.
Not that I coddled her, but they do form attachments in a very short period of time.
And, uh, the passport?
That should be ready Wednesday the latest.
Well, it's so nice of you to put us up like this.
Oh, it's all part of the service.
In my experience, a nice quiet place by the beach is just the right environment for these children to bond.
To get the sense that everything's okay now.
If you know what I mean?
I'm gonna...
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
We just became parents.
Look at this.
Wow.
Hey, guys.
Let's walk down and check out the beach.
Great idea.
The guy at the front said it was 83° water.
Is that what they said?
You swim?
You guys going down to the surf?
- Yeah.
- Oh, it's beautiful.
It's beautiful here.
I just got here,
I'm gonna go get my trunks and go in, I think.
- Okay.
- I'm Benjamin.
- Hey, Steven Mayer.
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my wife Shannon.
- Hi, Shannon.
Pleasure.
And our daughter Nina.
Hi, Nina.
How are you?
- Where are you guys from?
- Chicago.
Chicago.
Chicago, Illinois.
Nice.
Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm born in Minnesota, but yes, Chicago.
I'm a Chicago girl now.
- Yeah yeah, sure.
- That's where we met... art school.
Oh, art institute of Chicago, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I know it well.
You on vacation or...
Yeah, one of these corporate swag-a-thon things.
You know, a little work, little play.
We're just staying right there though.
It's beautiful.
Beautiful suites.
Oh, we're in that one.
Oh, great, neighbors.
Well, maybe I'll see you around later for a drink or something.
Thank you, that's nice.
I think, um, we're just gonna have an early night tonight and spend some time as a family.
- Yeah.
Great.
All right.
Leave you to it.
- All right, man, see you around.
- Enjoy it.
Have a great day at the beach.
It's nice to meet you, Mi...
- It's Nina?
- Nina!
- Nina.
- It's our neighbor.
- Yeah.
- What's a swag-a-thon?
- Yeah.
Oui.
These I got for you.
I thought they would look good.
Oh, they fit.
Merci.
- She's adorable.
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Oui.
- Oui?
- Yeah?
- Oui.
- She says, get over here.
- Okay.
- Papa should get over here.
- Alright.
It's our house.
Our house.
And that's your room.
It's yellow, what's yellow?
Jaune.
- The water nice?
- Yes, feel.
You said you were gonna get in.
I will, I will.
This is...
She's so adorable.
We know what we're doing, right?
Whatever we don't know we'll figure out.
Stupid people have kids every day.
It works out, right?
Right?
Right?
Tragic, but true.
And we're not stupid, so...
To not being stupid.
I love you.
I'm sorry if I...
it's Steve?
- Hey.
- Steven?
Steven and Shannon.
- Veronica and Salo.
- Hi.
Hey.
Hope we didn't keep you up last night.
We were a little over-served.
We were a little loud.
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.
All good.
- Okay.
See you later.
Bye.
Jeez, is he going north later?
Nina.
Nina!
I want to see if you can do this, okay?
You know what a...
you know what a cartwheel is?
- Cartwheel?
- I took high school French.
I don't know.
You like that?
Watch this one, watch.
Keep practicing.
Yes, yes.
Your crazy daddy.
Here.
Voila!
And... voila!
You want to decorate it?
That's a good idea.
That is perfect.
Hey.
Nina, regard.
Over there, across the ocean... that's where our house is.
La maison?
- Mm-hmm.
Soon as we get your passport, we'll go there.
Nina!
That looked so good I had to join you.
Nothing like a cool drink on a hot day, cheers.
Cheers.
Yeah, they do a good virgin Mary if you like those.
- Not bad.
- You... you don't drink?
No.
Need a little hair of the dog, you know?
I just needed a minute from the sun.
She's really beautiful, Nina.
You must be really excited.
Yeah, we're insanely lucky.
She's, um... she's adopted I take it, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Where from?
- From Haiti.
- Haiti.
Why Haiti?
Do you know?
I mean, do you have any...
We didn't really specify.
It was more just...
Do something good for someone in need.
And anyplace where it's bad, it's even worse for children.
I was in Haiti.
I know how bad it is there.
You were in Haiti?
Yeah, working with an N.G.O.
Terrible there.
Anyway, the reason I asked you is because I admire you.
Thank you.
You know, because I was adopted.
I was a foster kid.
You know, it's tough.
- Oh, I was adopted.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Wow, cheers.
The world's a lot better place for you and your husband doing it.
Thank you, that's nice.
What's your tat?
It's a poem.
Let me see your hand there.
- "Invictus." - "Invictus."
Look at that life line.
Nina, looks good.
- C'est bon.
- C'est bon.
You've reached International Rescue Adoptions.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey, Mrs. Reigert, it's, uh, Steven Mayer.
Um, we had a great couple days at the resort, but we decided to move to the Caribbean hotel.
It's closer to old San Juan, and there's more stuff for kids to do here, so... hi, Steven.
Oh, hey...
hey, Gabrielle.
Um, yeah, the neighbors were a little loud last night, so we kind of decided we'd move.
Oh, that's not good, keep you awake.
No, no, no.
It's fine, and we appreciated being there.
It's just, um...
The Caribbean Hotel, you said?
Yeah.
I know it well.
It's beautiful.
You're gonna love it there.
Hey, any word on the passport?
Oh, still Monday or Tuesday or even Wednesday I'm afraid.
It'll come by registered post.
How's Nina?
She's just, uh...
She's great.
We're all very, very happy.
Feels like she's been with us forever.
Good, good.
Well, you have a great time.
Enjoy yourselves.
Okay, catch up Monday.
- Okay, thanks.
- Bye.
She picked the pink one.
- I think I did all right.
- I like it.
I did good, right?
Want to see?
Tu veux voir?
Yes!
I should take a picture.
You're asleep already?
I'm so tired.
Like mother, like daughter.
Baby, I'm kind of wired.
I think I'm gonna take a walk.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'll be back.
Love you.
Love you too.
And here's the weather for Chicago...
Baby, it was only a few drinks.
It's always only two drinks.
- Steven, come on.
- What?
All right, just...
let me give her a kiss, okay?
- Okay.
- And you have the best mommy in the world.
That's true, but... but mommy's trying to get us home.
And you've had too much to drink, so... low of 46, on Sunday, partly Sunny...
Shannon!
Hey.
- You guys are everywhere.
- Hi.
- What are you drinking?
- This guy here.
- Grab a table, Salo.
- Good to see you again.
What do you want, man?
What are you drinking?
I think I'm on my way out.
Don't worry about it.
I'm buying, so...
- Um...
- ...
Might as well have one.
A near beer.
- Non-alcoholic?
- Yeah.
Uh, four, one...
- No alcohol?
- Not tonight.
Are you guys from here, the island?
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.
- Locals.
- Beautiful place to live.
Not as good as America though, right?
I wouldn't say that.
It's amazing here.
- It's fucking amazing here, right?
- Yeah, I love it.
I like Puerto Rican Chinese girls.
Here you go.
Go easy on that one there.
Yeah, I don't drink much anymore, but I still like the taste of beer, so...
I don't know, man.
I...
I quit for a while, and then I realized I really wanted...
Alcohol.
- Cheers.
- Salud.
Cheers.
Steven here is on a mission of mercy.
- A mission?
- Well...
He adopts needy kids from Dante's inferno and whisks them back to America.
We're adopting one.
The little girl you saw us on the beach with, she's a Haitian refugee.
And we're adopting her.
- Oh, that's lovely.
- Isn't it?
Did you ever spend any time down there?
Like... no, not that region.
You?
Yeah, I spent some time down there.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I was doing like a... working with security for this place called P.N.C.
Guards medical supplies.
And it was kind of a...
- after the earthquake?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Anyway, here's to you.
It's a great thing what you're doing, man.
- Cheers.
- Appreciate it.
All right, guys, I told Shannon
I'd be five minutes, so I'm gonna head out.
- You can't go now, man.
- Why can't I?
You can't walk out on your round.
It's basic Puerto Rican manners.
We get you a round, you get us a round.
You owe us a round.
See, we got you the first round.
Now, you get us the second round.
I understand, okay.
I can...
I can do that.
Salo's got a lot of rules.
That's not a rule.
Come on, man.
Can I get another round of what he ordered?
Four-and-four.
Exactly.
There's etiquettes everywhere.
Is it expensive?
- What's that?
- Well, the whole process.
You know, cutting through all the red tape.
Um, I suppose if one does, but we went a more straightforward route.
No, I mean, is it hard... like, do you have to need an expeditor or do they bilk you for more and more money or anything?
I mean, you know, I...
I can't speak to that.
The waiting is difficult.
You know, but...
- There it is.
- You guys having another?
Yeah.
Here, brother.
You got to drink that.
Um, let's see.
Um, this should cover both rounds.
You guys have a great evening.
All right, bud.
- Is that for me, dude?
- We're not good enough for you?
- Shannon, it's not what you think.
- Have you lost your mind?
I didn't do anything, I promise.
I didn't know where you were.
You call me from a police station in the middle of the night.
They wouldn't let me just walk out of here on my own.
I had no choice.
It's the way they do things here.
Have you been drinking?
No, the guy dumped beer on me.
It was the weird people from the cabin that we keep running into.
They just twisted the story all around.
Sir.
Sign here, will you please?
Is this really happening?
Are we really back here?
I didn't do...
Nina, um...
Oui.
Nina, I'm sorry mommy had to wake you up in the middle of the night.
I hope you can forgive me.
Yeah?
Hello.
Heard it was the wild, wild west out there, huh?
It was, um, a misunderstanding.
Yeah, you had a run-in with some troublemakers, I understand?
Yes, actually, I did.
I was attacked for no reason.
I tried to explain that to your officers.
Yeah, well, a nice family like you shouldn't have to deal with that type of nonsense.
Life shouldn't have to be that complicated.
That's my card if you need anything.
And who might this little florecita be?
It's our daughter, Nina.
Lovely.
Well, look, we really love tourists here, so please enjoy yourselves.
Do yourself a favor... stay out of bars for awhile, okay?
Yes, sir.
You up?
Yeah.
Baby, I'm sorry about last night.
It won't happen again.
Do you know what I...
What I really think would make everything better?
What?
Pancakes.
Okay.
- That's easy.
- I'm the world's cheapest date.
You order pancakes, I'll see if Nina's awake.
Okay.
Nina, honey.
Nina, honey.
Steven!
She's not up here!
What?
What do you mean she's not here?
Nina!
Honey?
Nina.
Nina!
Her shoes are gone!
The door was locked.
She's not here.
- Nina!
- Nina!
Nina!
- I'll ask reception.
- Okay.
- Nina!
- Nina!
Hi.
I'm looking for my daughter.
She was in her room.
She's been missing...
I don't know for how long.
- Nina!
- She's seven years old.
She's about this tall.
- Excuse me, sir, can I help you?
Yeah, our daughter's missing.
Okay, how old is she?
Uh, she's seven, she's Haitian.
Maybe you saw her come through the lobby?
I'm sorry.
- She was wearing...
- She was wearing, uh, pink pajama pants
- with polka dots and a blue t-shirt.
- Okay, calm down, calm down.
You know, the little ones, they go where they want and suddenly they turn up, so...
- Oh my God, Steven!
- ...
Not to worry.
- Sir?
Sir?
- The pool!
- She's in the pool!
- Sir?
This isn't happening.
Someone on your staff had to see her.
Mr. Mayer, there's certain protocol that we follow here, and we're doing that.
Getting angry with the staff?
It's not gonna help.
- What about security footage?
- We're looking into that.
She can't have just disappeared.
Children do wander off.
What?
A seven-year-old with a complex past, brand new set of circumstances, bewildered, overwhelmed.
We're looking into every possibility.
And considering the conflict the other night, we have to investigate that.
Can you make a list of other places you've been since you arrived and the people that you met?
And also, do you have any photos of Nina?
I'll get my computer.
If she did wander off alone, she's probably out there hungry by now.
Someone has to notice a little girl all alone.
What about the adoption agency?
- How well did they know her?
- We've been calling them.
We're waiting for Nina's passport to come through.
They didn't answer yesterday.
I'm trying to bring up her profile picture on the website, but...
There's no website.
How much did you pay for this adoption?
Uh... $60,000.
Excuse me.
We'll be in touch.
I'm sorry.
We've been parents for 48 hours.
She couldn't have walked out on us, could she?
What do you mean?
I mean, she couldn't have wanted to, right?
She seemed so happy.
All I ever wanted to be was a mother.
Pretend with my little sister,
I'd... bathe her and feed her and tuck her in at night.
I swore that when I had kids of my own
I would never abandon them the way that my birth mother... mother abandoned me.
So we have to find her, okay?
We will, okay?
We will.
I just...
because... because I don't know what to do, Steven, and I don't know where she is.
I'm going back to that office.
You think that that's a good idea?
No one's answering the phone, the website's down.
I'm gonna go confront her directly.
Maybe we should just let the cops handle that.
The cops don't care, Shannon.
We're tourists.
They got enough problems of their own.
- Just... just keep looking.
- Okay, go.
I'll keep looking, okay.
What the fuck?
Nina?
Perdon.
- Yeah.
- Mrs. Mayer.
- You had some new info?
Well, we contacted the consulate and your paperwork was never processed.
No Gabrielle Reigert or Nina Duvalier.
That has to be a mistake.
Let me guess.
She told you she would contact you when your passport came in, so all Nina had to do was wander off at the appointed time into her waiting arms.
No, um...
No, our room was locked.
We would've heard the door open.
The scam is called reclaiming.
And, unfortunately, it's not rare.
What they do, they get as much money as they can, take the kid back, on to the next victim.
New web site, new city, new country.
- It's very hard to track.
It's all over Asia now.
- This website had, um... it had all these, uh, links, and it had testimonials.
Well, websites will do that.
Where's your husband?
Sir, sir...
No, no.
Uh, just keep that.
Thank you.
I don't know exactly.
He's out looking for her.
Yeah, we heard about a break-in in old San Juan.
I don't know anything about that.
We don't need vigilantes.
We're gonna find the girl.
Comandante, this, um... this scam that you're talking about...
It might be true...
But it also might not be.
- So you have to keep looking for her.
- We will keep looking.
- You have to find her.
- We will.
Sorry, have you seen this little girl?
Sorry, I'm just looking for this little girl.
Esta Niña.
Um, have you seen her?
Esta Niña.
Can you... no, you haven't seen her?
This little girl, have you seen her?
I did a really stupid thing, Shannon.
We did a stupid thing.
No, I did.
You looked so happy.
We just finished painting her room.
Everything was set.
And then I get an email out of nowhere saying the whole thing fell apart.
What are you talking about?
She said she could make it go away.
She... she said no one would know...
So I paid her.
We'd already paid.
I paid her more to make it work.
How much more?
Another 30.
Fuck.
Fuck, Steven.
Steven, you're telling me you bought our daughter on the black market.
No, no.
No.
She was an official expeditor, Shannon.
She had... you saw her credentials, and that office.
Baby, we were so close.
What was I supposed to do?
What about run it by me?
Communicate?
I wanted everything to work out.
And so what?
You decided that you would just take shortcuts as usual?
We were on a waiting list back home, remember?
Another two to three more years.
I was fine to wait.
Oh, sure, you were fine to wait.
If you already paid her, why didn't she just not show up?
Fuck.
What?
There were...
Additional fees...
This week.
The money came through yesterday.
- I guess she was waiting...
- Are you fucking serious?
And the passport story was there to just string us along.
More than the 30?
Not as much...
another 10.
We're never gonna see her again.
Maybe she was never ours.
- Maybe none of this was real.
- It was real.
You felt it too, didn't you?
Yeah, I thought I did.
But... is she...
Does she even belong to us, legally?
If this is a scam, if they're criminals,
- do we even stick around?
- She's a little girl.
She's out there somewhere with God knows what kinds of people.
She was supposed to be our daughter.
Doesn't that mean we're supposed to try?
Of course it does.
Yes.
Let's...
let's drive around some more.
I just...
I need some time, okay?
You drive around.
Shit.
- Hey, Shannon.
- Shannon?
It's Benjamin and Veronica.
- I just wanted to say we're really sorry...
- I know that.
For what happened the other night.
- It was just a misunderstanding...
- I know Steven didn't pick a fight with you.
He's so passive, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
He didn't pick a fight with me, it was my buddy Salo, anyway.
We just didn't know that he didn't drink.
Look, my daughter's missing, so I don't... can we just not?
You're daughter's missing?
Where is she?
Yeah, it's all...
it's all part of some scam.
A scam?
Yeah, these people, they just... they, um...
They give you a little girl, they get a 100 grand from you...
And then they take her back.
A 100 grand?
Oh my God.
Well, what are you gonna do?
- Did you talk to the police?
- Yeah, I called the cops.
What did they say?
I mean, what's the next step?
- Will you excuse me?
How do you not tell me about something that big...
Shannon, I knew if I told you about the money you would've just...
If you told me about the money, I would've said it was a bad idea.
Okay, well, I thought I was making a good decision for us.
This isn't about doing something good.
It's about your complete lack of judgment.
Thanks.
A marriage is a partnership, okay?
You never talk to me!
We are still gonna talk about this.
I know where she is.
- I'm calling the police.
- Wait.
Benjamin has her.
- What are you talking about?
- I can take you to her.
Why should we trust you?
We don't have another option.
Is she okay?
She's fine.
She's just scared.
- Why are you helping us?
- Yeah.
Because I don't want to be a part of it.
Say a fucking word I'm gonna blow your head off, okay?
- Go to the wall.
Put your hands up on the wall.
Against the wall now!
Hands down.
Shh.
Put your hands behind your back.
Get the tape.
Be quiet.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right, stay there.
Wallet?
All right.
Hotel room key.
Check them out, you drive their rental car.
See you there.
Let's move.
Feet up.
Welcome to your Puerto Rican vacations, motherfuckers.
Get the fuck out!
Hurry up!
Move.
Move.
Move, you fucking gringo.
Move, you motherfucker!
Sit down.
Sit the fuck down!
Sit the fuck down!
Motherfucker, I will shoot your fucking brains out.
What did you do with Nina?
She's fine, really.
Nina's fine, no problem.
Please, just tell us what you want.
All in good time.
So you got somebody in Chicago that looks after your money?
- Our money?
- Yeah.
Shannon, you come from money.
And you had a big fucking pile of it even before the accident, right?
There's nothing left.
Really?
$2.9 million settlement?
Think I'm a fucking moron?
August 12th, 2010, "Chicago Sun Times,"
"Chicago woman receives civil settlement in city tragedy.
Late afternoon it was ruled that the Cooke County Department of Public Works was at fault when a waste disposal truck collided with Shannon Mayer, 27, of Oak Park..."
Please, stop it.
- "...claiming the life of her unborn daughter."
- That's enough!
- And you lost the ability to bear more children.
All right, so you have money.
What did you do with it?
I mean, you don't strike me as the extravagant type.
We... we bought a house.
We, um... we rebuilt a life.
We started a charitable trust.
- We adopted Nina.
- You know what you did?
You invested.
- Right?
- He's a toy designer.
We don't really make that much, and I haven't worked since the accident.
What kind of fucking toys do you make?
All right, you didn't work after the accident?
I'm telling you, man, there's nothing there.
Steven...
You're supposed to be a smart guy.
I know all about you.
All right, we have something in common here.
You know this woman, Gabrielle Reigert?
That's not her real name.
Her real name is Angie.
So this funny, little woman comes up to me in some shit-hole, business-class airport lounge and says, "come do this thing."
"Who is this woman?" I'm thinking.
"What is she, fucking intel?
What is she, Blackwater?
Christian outreach?"
I don't give a fuck.
She says, "I pay cash. $25,000 a pop."
So to be fair to you, it's not just you and your bank accounts that I don't altogether trust.
Like maybe she burned me a little bit.
And after your wife and I had a little get together in town... nothing untoward, brother, nothing untoward... well, I decided we had to check out a few things.
See, usually we just take the kid and you leave the island burning in shame.
But necessity brings us together one more time.
And while we're here, you know, we're gonna do this other thing because this is, after all, what we do for a living.
- You're wasting your time.
I don't think I am, Steven.
Okay, we want to do Bank of America or Citibank?
Bank of America?
Okay, Steven, now we need the passcode, so it'll all go a lot easier if you just give it to me.
I'm telling you, you are wasting your fucking time.
All right, now I think you're lying to me.
And I don't think you're the only one who's lying to me.
But I'm telling you something, I'm sick of being lied to.
So let's be really clear about what the stakes are.
Those are the stakes!
- We'll blow her fucking brains out!
- Leave her alone!
- Blow her brains out next!
- Leave her alone!
- Tell him the fucking password!
- Leave her alone!
- The password!
Shit.
All right, okay, all right, all right!
Okay!
All right.
What is it?
7-1-2... 7-3-5.
Is that it?
- Hold on, just...
- Let go of her.
- Let go of her.
- Let her go!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Hey, hey, come on now.
- You piece of shit.
- Shut the fuck up, mother fucker.
Hey, calm down.
Everybody take a deep breath, okay?
Baby, I shouldn't have been so drunk that night.
If I wasn't and you didn't have to come get me, none of this would have ever happened.
We wouldn't be here.
I know I can't change the past.
- God knows I wish I could.
- Baby, this is not your fault.
But I can get us out of this, I promise you.
I promise.
Good morning.
So, listen...
I got an email from Jerry, your man in Chicago.
Uh, what's his name, Rosenberg something?
Anyway, he emailed, the transfer's gonna take 48 hours.
So today is gonna be kind of a lay-around day, you know, nothing to do.
Look, I'm not a monster or anything, and I'll bring you some food and water.
And maybe you can even take a shower or something.
How do you live with yourself?
I'm sorry.
What was that?
How do you live with yourself?
Yeah, you know, it's rough, Shannon, but, just...
I do what I can.
What happens to Nina?
You can have her when this is all done.
I don't give a fuck about the kid.
If things go smooth, the kid's yours.
How do we know she's alive?
Well, that's a fair question.
Let me get back to you on that, Steven.
Okay?
Answer the fucking question!
You're gonna get to see your daughter.
She's in that house, Shannon, I know it.
- They're gonna kill us, no matter what.
- No, no, no.
We're gonna get the money.
They'll give us Nina back.
- They can blindfold us and...
- Nobody even knows that we're here.
Shannon, we are getting out of this.
You go into the bank.
You have to tell them everything.
No, baby, no.
No, we have to give them what they want.
It's only money.
They're after the money.
They'll let us go.
Somebody help us!
Somebody!
Somebody help us!
Help!
Somebody help us!
Somebody!
They think you want to kill them.
Nina showered, ready for bed?
Mm-hmm.
You want me to check on her?
A little bit to the left.
Left, over here.
- Here?
- Yeah.
All right.
Angie.
Benjamin, I've got another job for you
- starting next week.
- Oh, yeah?
It's a west coast couple, San Francisco, arriving Saturday.
Great.
Listen, Benny, um...
This job's not as good as the one we're doing now.
But I'm still confident we'll see about 15 out of it each.
- Price is going down?
- Well, just a little.
It's still worth it.
I might be able to squeeze a little bit more out of them.
So, I'll see you in a few days with Nina, right?
- Of course.
- Okay.
Everything okay?
Oh, Waldo.
Listen to the happy laughter of those friendly natives.
Then there's the one about the...
All right.
Showtime.
That's today.
Okay?
It's a big day.
We're gonna go to the bank.
We'll get you the money.
Okay, we're gonna cooperate and we're gonna get you the money...
And then we're gonna forget all about you.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- Please, just take the money and let us go.
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
I don't want any violence.
We good?
When you get to the bank, Salo's gonna uncuff you, then you're on your own.
He's gonna be following you, but not like he knows you.
If you do anything or if you tip anybody off, last thing he does before he leaves the bank,
is shoot you.
If he shoots you, that means we're not getting our money, which basically means, we're shooting you in anger.
It goes without saying, we don't want to shoot you or your wife.
So that's it, that's the play.
It's up to you, man.
Don't fuck up.
Hey, we're gonna leave soon.
Yeah?
And we're gonna do the same thing we did before.
We're gonna pack up and travel and maybe meet another family and play the same game.
Okay?
You're doing great.
Hi, my name's Steven Mayer.
Mr. Lopez is expecting me.
Oh, yes, Mr. Mayer, the transfer, right?
Yes.
Please, let me check your documents.
It's a long drive out here.
We're staying in...
is it "Monaba"?
- Maunabo.
- Maunabo.
There's a big tunnel out there, yeah?
Oh, yes.
Let me get Mr. Lopez for you.
Okay.
Alfonso Lopez, how do you do?
Uh, Steven Mayer, thank you so much for getting this done.
Unusual transaction.
Sometimes in Puerto Rico we have problems with money laundering.
Oh, we're, uh... we're buying land here, actually.
It cost $600,000, but they said they would knock off $100,000 if we paid cash, so...
Excuse me.
- Enjoy your property.
- Thank you.
Give me the money bag.
Not until I have Nina and my wife.
This isn't time to fuck with me, okay?
Hey!
I need to get to Maunabo.
Quickly please, por favor.
We good?
- We got a problem.
- What kind of problem?
I lost him.
We got out of the bank, he just took off with the fucking money.
Stay there.
Pack up, laptops, everything.
Meet me at Angie's in 15 minutes.
Okay.
Can I use your phone?
It's an emergency.
- Este Diaz.
- It's Steven Mayer.
I'm on my way to Maunabo.
Shannon's there in a shed somewhere and Nina's there.
Benjamin kidnapped us.
Okay, Steve, I need you to slow down.
- Tell me where you are.
- I'm in a cab.
Okay, so the place... it's about a mile after you come out of the Maunabo tunnel.
Um, you'll see a boat in a tree.
Okay, look, this is what I need you to do, okay?
I need you to take that cab to the station.
We're on our way to Maunabo.
And as soon as we find your family,
I will call you, okay?
There won't be enough time.
- You got him?
- What?
- Do you have him?
- No.
Keep looking.
Boy, oh, boy.
Nina, stay in your room!
All right, it's gonna be a left up here.
You'll see...
you'll see a boat in a tree.
He's here.
Load the shotgun, take the safety off.
When he gets out of the car, put him on the ground.
Wait here a minute.
I'll be right out.
- We're going back to San Juan?
- Yeah.
Lie down.
Drop the bag.
Salo, you piece of shit, you lost him.
He's coming back here now.
The police will be here any second.
You still have time to go.
I said drop the fucking bag.
They're gonna arrest you.
Get the fuck out of here!
Go!
Get out of here!
I said drop it!
Benjamin is on his way back.
What's he paying you?
Whatever it is, I'll double it.
I have money right here.
Look, I'll show you.
Hey!
Turn around!
Turn around now!
Let's go!
Get in the house!
Shannon, come on, let's go!
Nina!
Come on.
Good girl.
Come on.
- Is she okay?
- She's good, she's good.
Go, go, go.
Shit.
He's turning around.
He's coming.
- Steven!
It's okay.
Get down!
Baby, you okay?
Nobody move, nobody move.
Stay still, Shannon.
I'm gonna get out and come to that window, okay?
Okay.
Shit.
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah.
Okay, Nina, you're gonna come with me.
Hang on to me, Nina.
Shannon, grab me.
Grab me, grab me.
Grab me, Shannon.
Shannon.
Baby?
- What?
- You got to let me go.
You're gonna need both hands.
Steven, you've got to let me go.
Baby.
You've got to save Nina!
- All right, grab onto something, honey, grab on!
- I got it.
I got it.
Okay, I got it.
Come on, it's okay.
Come on.
Just look at me.
Stay here, all right?
All right, Shannon, give me your hands.
Shannon, hang on!
Hang on!
Hang on!
Steven!
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Grab the strap!
- I can't.
You got to do it.
- Grab the strap.
- I can't!
Come on, you got to do it, just grab it.
Mama, mama!
Where's Benjamin?
His car's down there.
I think he's dead.
Anybody else here?
The girlfriend might still be at the house.
If you send someone, maybe you can catch her.
You okay, little one?
You okay?
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Please, to the car.
- What's in the bag?
- Uh...
Lot of cash.
- Go.
- Sir.
Hey, uh...
I would like to apologize for not believing you guys about those two.
It's fine.
It's not necessary.
Thank you.
Well, you're safe now.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I got you.
You guys okay?
It's okay.
Yeah, you?
Don't fucking move!
- Okay, okay.
- Don't fucking move!
Do not move!
- We're gonna go for a little walk.
- Shannon, just stay calm.
- No, no, no.
Just take the money.
- Stay calm.
Steven!
- You son of a bitch!
- What?
- Just take the money!
- Oh, I'm gonna take the money.
Steven!
Steven!
Not much time.
Help!
Go home, Nina.
Steven!
Hey, you want this?
- Go on up.
- All right.
- Home sweet home, Nina.
- Ben?
- What the fuck, Ben?
- What kind of woman uses children?
- Fuck off!
- Sit the fuck down.
What the fuck, Ben?
Big day, Angie.
- Change of plans.
- Where's the husband?
Oh, he's in the trunk... trunk of the car out there.
We got a cop car.
We got two cars I got to get rid of.
Dead bodies, cops.
I don't know where Veronica is.
Salo's dead.
These are not my problems, Ben.
What's mine is yours, Angie.
All I'm saying is, we should be discreet.
Uh-huh.
An opportunity arose and I had to act fast.
- An opportunity?
- They had more money.
So, you got more money.
That's great.
Like I said, it's been a big day.
Of course.
Shannon, this is Angie.
Angie, Shannon.
Angie is sort of the mastermind of this whole thing.
She organizes everything and she seduces the young couples like you who don't want the, you know, fresh new puppies from the pet shop.
You'll take the older ones 'cause you got a conscience.
Nina, sweetie, will you go play in your room?
The adults have to talk.
Go on, baby.
Like I said, it's been a big day.
Ben, I think we should do what needs to be done.
We'll do it together.
We're partners, after all.
I'll help you... cars, bodies.
- Yeah?
- Okay.
You got my cut?
Of course I got your cut.
How much?
The usual.
25.
50% of 50 grand.
How much you pay, Shannon?
Ben, there is a lot more money coming in.
You're gonna get a lot more money, sweetheart.
Every little bit counts, right?
I'm gonna give you more money...
- No!
- Nina!
Go back to your room.
Go back to your room.
Nina!
- What happened, bitch?
- You hurt your ankle?
Fuck you.
You don't have to do this.
You can have the money.
You can have whatever you want.
We're good people.
I know you're good people.
I mean, I know the difference.
You know?
You would have been really good for Nina.
Yeah, we would have been.
Yeah, we would have been.
We would have taken really good care of her.
Please.
Please, please don't kill me.
Put it down!
Put the gun down!
Or what, Steven, you gonna shoot me in the back?
- Yes, I will.
- We both know you're not gonna do that.
- Man, I swear to God I'll do it.
- Yeah?
Your wife's got more balls than you
- and she's unarmed.
- Don't fucking test me!
Put the gun down!
I've seen the way you look at him.
I know.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- Oh my God.
- It's okay now.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
- Nina.
- Nina.
Nina, no, no, no.
Put... put the gun down on the ground.
We're not gonna hurt you.
We want to take care of you.
Nina.
Nina.
- It's okay now, sweetheart.
- It's okay.
We want to take care of you, Nina, but you have to put the gun down.
We want to take you home.
Okay?
And you'll have your own room... your yellow room, Nina.
You want to come with us?
Great job.
Good girl.
Hey...
You all right?
You don't have to do this anymore, okay?
We're gonna take care of you.
Come on.
You're okay.
It's okay.
Good girl.

Previously on "Devious Maids"...
This is not your house!
I am seriously thinking about asking Nick to fire her.
I will personally see to it that my label honors our deal.
You are the best husband I never married.
[Guests screaming] I'm not screwing around, people!
[Grunts]
Oh, my God.
You shot him!
[Voice breaking] Somebody call 911!
So, your husband doesn't talk?
Not since the stroke, and...
I'm his daughter.
I'm his wife.
Oh.
I know how it looks.
But every once in a while, I need to have a good time.
I gave up my whole life for him.
You are such a liar.
I think that means I work for him.
Can I talk to you about something?
Are you going to ask me out?
You're unhappy?
Since as long as I can remember.
So, you're leaving me?
I'm taking a break.
Aah!
Adrian is convinced the gunmen will come back.
This robbery has revealed a new side to Adrian, and it frightens me, because there's one thing that I cannot tolerate...
And that is weakness.
Somebody gave this to me.
Now you're going to give it to me.
How can I ever repay you?
Seeing you smile is payment enough.
Beverly Hills is under attack.
Twice in the last month, residents of our street have been brutalized by home invaders.
One of our neighbors, Alejandro Rubio, is dead.
The time has come for us to meet this threat head-on.
What exactly are you suggesting?
A neighborhood watch.
Ah.
I gonna need another scotch.
The idea is to augment our own security with nightly patrols.
And who would do these patrols?
We would.
"We," as in...
Our servants?
No, the residents of canon drive.
We'd all take shifts walking our street at night, then call the police if we see anyone suspicious.
Well, everyone looks suspicious to me.
But that's because I'm a little racist.
Wait...
Can't we pay a company to do this type of thing for us?
Armor alert had a car three blocks away the night our home was broken into.
It was useless!
We need another layer of security.
Well, maybe we could host a benefit luncheon to combat gun violence.
Wouldn't that be better?
How would that be better?
Everything's better with a luncheon.
[Inhales deeply] What is wrong with you people?
!
If you think they won't come after you, you are kidding yourself.
You're not safe.
You're not special.
They will come into your home and attack you and beat you.
And you will deserve it because you're too cowardly to stop them.
Thank you so much for coming, Tanya.
So, I'll see you at the club then?
Absolutely.
Tony, you'll see her to the door?
It would be his pleasure.
I realize you're still traumatized by the break-in, but my patience has officially expired. [Door opens]
[Door closes]
You are going to get help.
I don't care if it's thai massage or talk therapy or massive amounts of psychotropic drugs.
I will no longer be subjected to these paranoid rantings.
Do you understand me?
The house is all locked up, Mrs. Powell.
Anything else?
I want you to help my husband move his things to the guest room.
Until his psychosis has subsided, he is not welcome in my bed.
[Sighs]
You okay, Mr. Powell?
[Sighs] I will be.
I just need to take back control of my life.
Anything I can help you with?
Oh, yeah.
You're gonna get me a gun.
"I don't care what you have to do, Dahlia.
Get Opal out of that house immediately."
[Gasps] What did Opal do?
I don't know.
That's why I'm freaking out.
Where's the rest of the letter?
Those pages are missing.
[Sighs]
Did you talk to Nicholas?
No.
He'll tell me it's nothing, and I don't think it is.
Dahlia's mother wrote the letter.
Can't you talk to her?
Not without a ouija board.
She died last year.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Can I make a suggestion?
Yeah.
"Get Opal out of that house immediately."
I can't fire her for something that happened 15 years ago.
Unless it was really awful.
I wish I knew what her mother was referring to.
Well, then... find someone she was close to, someone she confided in.
Oh, yes.
Rich women always complain about their maids to their friends.
- You think?
- They complain about us.
We complain about them.
It's the circle of life.
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.
I got to go.
Hey, how's Carmen?
I left her a couple messages, but...
She still can't talk about it.
Of course not.
To see Alejandro killed like that.
And now his family has arrived for the funeral.
How's that going?
[Sobbing]
Renata wanted me to thank you both for taking such good care of her nephew.
Alejandro was a...
Wonderful man.
He meant the world to us.
[Sobbing continues]
Yeah, she's having a rough time.
He was all the family that she had left.
We're sorry for your loss!
Let us know if you need more Tequila.
So, y-you're Mrs. Rubio's lawyer?
Yeah, I came out from Miami to help her settle the estate.
Renata's had some pretty tough decisions to make.
Like what?
Alejandro, he left most of his money to charity.
His aunt only got the house, and she can't afford to maintain it, so it's gonna be sold.
Well... uh, can we at least stay here while you try to sell it?
Well, actually, we have a buyer, and he's paying cash.
But he's gonna need you out by Friday.
- Friday?
- Mm.
That's four days from now.
[Sobbing] Please.
This is a difficult situation for everyone.
Oh, mostly for the people getting kicked to the curb.
I'm sorry, but there's nothing that I can do.
[Sighs]
As far as I can tell, he's exactly the same.
Are you sure?
Last week, at dinner, he slammed his fist on the table.
[Chuckles] And you are?
Rosie.
She's the maid.
Well, there could be other explanations.
- Perhaps it was just a muscle spasm.
- Mnh-mnh.
He's still in there.
I can tell.
Maybe he would get better with therapy.
Well, I've checked all his markers, and there's no indication of improvement.
Unless you'd like a second opinion.
[Chuckles] Don't be silly.
We trust you.
Okay.
Thanks again for stopping by.
You're welcome.
[Door opens, closes]
He's a doctor who makes house calls.
You're supposed to kiss his ass, not insult him!
Some doctor.
He was barely here 10 minutes.
He took his pulse.
He went like this.
- I could do that.
- Really?
You got a medical degree I don't know about?
My abuelita had a stroke.
My doctor made her get therapy.
She learned how to walk again and talk.
Don't you want Mr. Kenneth to get better?
I think Dr. Sanders is doing a fine job.
Maybe you should think about doing yours.
Ew.
Can I help you?
I...
Heard about...
Mr. Rubio being killed.
I just wanted to...
I don't know what I wanted.
Were you a friend?
I guess.
I'm so sorry that this happened.
Don't worry.
The men who did this, they will be caught...
And punished.
- Hey, there.
- Hey.
I was just doing some homework.
But if you need the room, I can...
No, not at all.
Actually, I wanted task you something.
Are there any pictures of Dahlia around?
I've heard so much about her, and I have no idea what she looks like.
So, does Nicholas have a photo album?
Sure.
You want to check them out?
Yeah.
That's her.
Dahlia was beautiful.
Yeah.
That was some, uh, party that Nick threw for her.
I was really little at the time, but I remember watching everyone in their fancy clothes and...
[Chuckles] So, these are all Dahlia's friends?
Yeah.
She had a lot of them.
Wait, that woman.
Yeah, I clean her pool.
She was, like, Dahlia's best friend.
Why?
You know her?
I absolutely do.
[Vacuum whirring]
[Whirring stops]
Goodness.
So much noise from such a little machine.
Well, sorry, but I have to get this done before your luncheon tomorrow.
I know.
It's...
[Whirring resumes]
[Whirring stops]
I had my fillers injected today.
If I don't sleep, the botulism won't settle.
Well, I need 10 more minutes.
Then, I can scrub the floors... quietly.
But it's 11:00.
Don't you want to go home?
Not really.
I guess your house is feeling a little empty these days.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know what?
You need to have some fun.
Why not come to the luncheon?
I guess it would be nice to see how the other half lives.
Good.
I'm so happy.
You don't look happy.
That means the poison kicked in.
[Sighs] Wonderful.
Sí.
I'm off to my appointment.
When will you be back?
Couple hours.
Why?
No reason.
[Speaks spanish] Mr. Kenneth.
We got our own appointment.
Now, don't be scared.
We're just going to a wonderful clinic.
A friend of mine who works there is going to tell me how to make you better.
[Strained] Just...
Promise me not to tell Mrs. Didi.
[Sighs]
Good enough.
[Ringing]
[Chuckles] Valentina:
Hey, Remi.
Did I wake you?
[Chuckles] It's 2:00 in the morning.
Sorry...
I needed to talk to someone, and...
I didn't know who else to call.
My parents broke up.
[Yawns] That's sad.
Could you please not yawn while I'm telling you this?
Look, I-I just got done working a 20-hour shift.
I really need to get some sleep.
Fine.
I mean, you'll call me back, right?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Go back to bed.
[Cellphone beeps]
What a jerk.
Were you eavesdropping?
You're sort of...
In my office.
Fine.
Look, if you need someone to talk to, maybe we could go out to dinner some night.
I promise I'd be wide awake the whole time.
I can't go on a date.
I'm not over my relationship.
Really?
Because sleeping beauty sure seems like he's over you.
His name is Remi, and he's working his ass off to save people's lives.
Don't make fun of him!
Adrian.
[Chuckling] You'll never guess who I just ran into...
Cynthia Florek.
I told her about what you've been going through, and she suggested you try this organic herbal tea.
[Gasps] What in God's name is that?
It's a Ruger SR1911 Commander.
Isn't it beautiful?
[Breathing heavily]
You bought him a gun?
[Sighs]
Mr. Powell just wants to feel safe.
Oh, so do I, but I can't because the moron I'm married to is now armed and dangerous.
Relax.
I'm keeping an eye on him.
No, you should have come to me and asked for my permission.
But instead, you gave a deadly weapon to a man...
Now what are you doing?
I'm sweaty.
I need to dry off.
[Sighs] You were saying?
No, ah... [sighs]
I was saying you gave a deadly weapon to someone whose mental state...
[Breathes deeply]
Don't you know it's... offensive to disrobe in front of a lady?
I do.
But most ladies avert their eyes.
Stop changing the subject.
The topic at hand is your utter lack of judgment.
[Sighs]
Look... guns can be useful tools if you know how to use them.
I've got one in this room.
Would you like me to teach you how to handle it?
I will never handle any gun.
Especially yours.
How can they just kick us out?
Where are we supposed to go?
This is Odessa Burakov.
I'm calling to invite Mr. West to Alejandro Rubio's funeral.
'Cause I am broke.
I can't afford an apartment.
Well, don't you have a friend who can loan you money?
I don't know.
Do I?
It's Thursday at 2:00.
St. Peter's church in Beverly Hills.
See you then.
[Telephone beeps] It's not fair.
Alejandro was gonna get my career started.
He made promises to me.
Yes, it was very rude of him to die.
I don't mean it like that, Odessa.
I loved Alejandro.
But I want to be famous.
And that's gonna be harder to do once I'm living under a freeway.
I know you're worried, but Renata needs help planning the funeral.
It can't be all about you right now.
Can it be all about me tomorrow?
Yes.
Life will return to normal.
Now help me invite people to the service.
I know.
The ones with checks by their names are already coming.
Kanye?
Justin Timberlake?
Beyoncé is coming?
Oh, yes.
The entire recording industry will be there...
Singers, songwriters, producers.
Oh.
This is good.
Yeah, this is very good.
Buenos días, tia Renata.
[Sighs] How is the funeral coming along?
Oh.
There's so much to do.
- I'll bet, yeah.
- Oh.
Hey.
Have you thought about some music?
- Music?
- Yeah, sure.
I mean, what's a funeral without some singing.
Genevieve!
- Tanya!
- Hi, darling.
Mwah.
Mwah.
Oh, your skin is radiant.
Oh.
Who's doing your injections?
No one.
This is all natural.
[Both laugh]
Oh, that never gets old.
And neither do we.
[Laughs]
Tanya, you know Zoila.
Uh, no, I don't believe we've met.
I'm her maid.
We've met 10 times.
Oh.
My fault.
I never really look at the people who bring me drinks.
So...
[Chuckles]
Oh.
Our featured speaker just arrived.
He's going to be lecturing today on the cause of gun violence.
You leave me alone with this woman, and you'll be the cause of gun violence.
I'll be right back.
You know, it's a bit warm.
I should, uh...
I should get rid of this.
Genevieve invited me to this luncheon as her guest.
And there's a closet around the corner.
[Inhales sharply]
Look, I-I don't need all the details.
Just, um... make it go away.
[Chuckles] Okay?
You got it.
- Hey, Zoila.
- Oh.
Mm.
Thank you so much for getting me an invitation to this party.
They're all bitches.
Good luck to you.
Evelyn.
Oh.
Well, if it isn't the ghost of housecleaning past.
Nice to see you, too.
Why are you still working as a maid?
Don't tell me another family member's been falsely imprisoned.
I'm running in your circles these days.
I'm engaged to Nicholas Deering.
[Gulps]
Oh.
I hope this isn't awkward for you.
Adrian and I hired you to scrub our toilets, and now you're with a man worth twice what we are.
Why would that be awkward?
The other doctor says he can't get better, but I think he can.
Oh, I agree.
And I can't imagine why his family physician hasn't insisted on physical therapy.
That's what I said.
Right?
Didn't I say that?
Now, obviously, we'll have to work on his mobility...
Three times a week to begin with.
Uh, my office can refer a rehab facility.
Thank you so much, Dr. Joe.
I also want you to get a rubber ball.
Mm-hmm.
Have him practice squeezing.
Once he has mobility in his hand, get a keyboard in front of him.
See if he can type.
The sooner he can communicate with us, the better.
I will.
This is so exciting, Mr. Kenneth.
[Singsong voice] You're gonna get better.
[Normal voice] Thank you.
You doing okay back there?
We'll get you home soon.
[Gasps]
[Indistinct conversations]
Could I have my coat now?
Oh, right.
You have to apologize first.
Excuse me?
See, the way you demanded I just take your coat was, you know... rude.
Well, I don't think that I was rude.
Then you were raised by apes.
Give me my coat.
Hmm.
Genevieve, your maid refuses to give me my coat.
I told her I was here as your guest, and she just shoved that ratty old fur into my hands like I was her slave.
- To hell with her.
- Okay, okay.
What about this?
I'll get the coat.
Thank you.
I didn't put it in the closet.
Oh.
Where is it?
Not until I get an apology.
Okay, this is ridiculous.
Make her give me my coat.
Can't you just apologize?
Oh, for God's sake.
She is your maid.
Doesn't she have to do what you say?
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
Evelyn.
May I talk to you for a moment?
Why not?
I've just finished my third wine spritzer.
I'm ready to pretend we're equals now.
[Pats chair]
[Sighs]
So, I understand that you were very close with Nicholas' first wife.
I loved Dahlia like a sister.
And I'm guessing she confided in you.
All the time.
But I can't betray secrets.
- Can you gossip?
- That, I can do.
Did Dahlia ever...
Talk about her maid?
Opal?
Not really.
She complained about her housekeeping.
Opal was less than immaculate.
[Chuckles]
Not like you.
You can vacuum with the best of them.
Thank you.
So, Dahlia never talked about wanting to get rid of Opal?
No.
Although...
[Clears throat]
Since she died, there have been rumors.
Rumors?
This is the very worst kind of gossip.
People can be so cruel.
But it does make sense when you think about it.
What are you talking about?
He's been alone in that house for 15 years, never dating, never socializing.
And men have needs.
And she was right there.
Wait.
Wait.
Are you suggesting that Nick and Opal had an affair?
[Gasps] Oh, dear.
I hope this isn't awkward for you.
Very good, Mr. Kenneth.
Soon, you will be able to type on your computer, and we'll be able to have nice, long talks.
[Door closes] [Gasps]
I'll be right back, Mr. Kenneth.
You're back already?
Uh, yeah.
- Did you start dinner?
- I didn't have time.
While you were out, I took Mr. Kenneth to a new doctor.
What?
He says therapy will really help Mr. Kenneth.
He wants him to start going three times a week.
I don't care what some quack friend of yours wants.
You don't take my husband out of this house without my permission.
And then, coming back, this funny thing happened.
Are you listening to me?
You're fired.
I want you gone in an hour.
I saw you kissing Dr. Sanders in the street.
I was just... thanking him for his help with Kenny.
From what I saw, you were very, very thankful.
[Sighs]
Are you gonna tell Lucinda?
Not if you let Mr. Kenneth get the help he needs.
Fine.
But it won't do any good.
Bill says he's a lost cause.
My doctor promised me therapy will make a difference.
Why would bill lie?
Maybe he thinks you're more fun without a husband.
If there is a chance that Kenny can go back to being Kenny, of course I'd love to meet this new doctor.
Good.
Just try not to kiss this one.
[Keyboard clacking]
[Ringing]
Hello.
Um, hi.
I was looking for Remi.
Who are you?
I'm Heather.
I work with Remi.
And you are?
Nobody.
Don't move!
[Screams]
Oh.
It's just you.
Mr. Powell.
Why do you have a gun?
The men who invaded our home are going to come back.
I've got to be ready for them when they do.
Um...
Mr. Powell.
You don't look so good.
I know.
I haven't slept in days.
I was about to get myself some tea.
I could fix you some, too.
Yeah.
That would be nice.
Mmm.
That really hits the spot.
Thank you so much...
Valentina.
Mr. Powell, can I say something?
And I don't mean to offend you.
Go right ahead.
I'm worried about you.
Wandering around the house with a gun...
It's not good for you.
Did you know that Evelyn and I had a son?
- No.
- He died when he was six.
Oh, my God.
I gave him a bike for his birthday.
Evelyn took him out riding.
She turned her back for just a second.
He rode into the street, and this car came.
Whoever was driving didn't even stop.
They just kept going.
I'm so sorry.
I should have been there to protect him.
I wasn't.
And now... he's gone.
Evelyn is all I have left.
And no one... is going to take her from me.
[Cellphone ringing]
[Cellphone beeps] Hello?
Are you trying to get us arrested?
Get out of there now.
I'm not talking to anyone.
We don't care.
Just leave.
Okay.
And, Ty...
Don't pull this again.
[Engine turns over]
Hi.
Still looking through that album?
Yeah.
I found a crazy photo of me when I was five.
[Chuckles] If you think that I am handsome now.
I bet you were adorable.
Mm.
Where's your mom?
I need to talk to her.
Uh, she's at the store.
Nicholas gets home tomorrow, so she's gonna bake him a cake.
Oh.
That's nice of her.
She's always doing stuff like that for him.
So, who does nice things for your mom?
What do you mean?
Well, is there someone special in her life?
You mean does she date?
Oh, please, don't go there.
[Laughing] What?
She's a woman.
Most women crave companionship.
No, not my mom.
[Laughs]
She wasn't always single.
What about your dad?
What about him?
Did I say something wrong?
I'm sorry, no.
It's just, uh, I don't know who my father is.
What?
Yeah, for years, I begged my mom to tell me, but she said it was better for everyone if I didn't know, so I stopped asking.
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
It sucks.
A-and I don't care if he was a jerk or if it was a one-night stand.
I just want to know who my dad was, you know?

Hector, if you don't pick up the pace,
I'll be singing at your funeral next week.
Take five, everybody.
When I'm back, be better.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Renata told me you offered to sing at the memorial.
I thought it would be nice to have a little musical tribute.
Doesn't seem like much of a tribute.
Seems like an audition.
Alejandro believed in me, Odessa.
He would have wanted me to have this chance.
This funeral is for people who loved him, who want to say goodbye with a little dignity.
For God's sake!
I'm gonna be dignified.
I finished putting the sequins on your dress.
Not now, Jimmy!
Listen, I got to finish rehearsing.
He died in your arms, Carmen!
How can you think about anything but saying goodbye to that dear, sweet man?
I loved Alejandro.
But he's dead.
I'm not.
And I'm gonna be a star.
Are you ready?
Come on.
[Sighs]
[Door opens]
Knock, knock.
Genevieve isn't here right now.
Well, actually, I'm here to see you.
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am for my behavior at the luncheon.
Wow, that coat must have cost you a bundle.
No, no.
This is a sincere apology.
I was incredibly insensitive, and I truly hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Um...
[Inhales deeply] Okay.
You are forgiven.
Wonderful.
I want us to be friends.
Maybe we can see a movie sometime.
[Exhales sharply]
Before we pencil anything in, let me get your coat.
I really do appreciate your apology.
The truth is I was also a little bit out of line.
Well, at least you have an excuse for your behavior.
I don't.
Huh?
Well, Genevieve explained your terrible situation to me.
And I went through the same thing last year.
So humiliating.
What exactly did she tell you?
Well, that your husband dumped you.
And after 20 years of marriage, I mean, it's no wonder you've been so cranky and irritable.
Well... thanks.
[Door opens, closes]
Hey.
I'm not doing anything this weekend, and I thought maybe if you weren't doing anything...
Maybe... we could not do anything together?
What about your, uh...
Your friend from the Congo?
He's in the Congo.
And I think he's made a new friend, so... maybe I should, too.
How's he doing?
Heather:
Not well.
His fever's up.
You tried the antibiotics?
He's not responding to them.
And I'm starting to get worried.
Finally.
[Scoffs] Zoila.
It's after 10:00.
I thought you'd gone home.
What's wrong?
I haven't even told my friends about Pablo.
Now I find out you've been gossiping about my personal life.
Do you know how that makes me feel?
Humiliated?
Exactly.
What are you doing?
[Sighs] I'm sitting.
[Scoffs]
Go on.
You told Tanya so she would apologize.
You'd rather betray my confidence than be embarrassed about some stupid coat.
Well?
Aren't you gonna defend yourself?
I was wrong.
What's with all the serenity?
See, I don't mind if you yell because I know you're not really angry with me.
- Oh, yes, I am.
- No.
And you're not angry about Tanya's coat, either.
This is about your husband.
So, you can yell and throw things and tell me to go to hell because I'm not Pablo or Valentina.
I will never leave you.
See?
This is why it's important that we talk these things out.
Because if we don't, we cry and ruin our makeup. [Sniffles]
I should probably go.
To that empty house?
No.
You're gonna stay here for awhile.
I couldn't impose.
Don't be silly.
It'll be fun.
We'll stay up late and eat carbs.
[Chuckles]
What do you say?
[Sniffles]
I say...
You're an amazing woman.
It's so true.
[Moaning]
[Breathing heavily]
Tony?
It's Mrs. Powell...
Evelyn.
I wanted to talk to you.
[Doorknob rattling]
For God's sake.
[Chuckles]
[Gunshot]
[Gasps] [Thud]
Evelyn!
You idiot.
Shouldn't we take her to the hospital?
You just grazed her.
And besides, they have to report gunshot wounds.
You could be arrested.
But Evelyn wouldn't press charges.
Would you, sweetheart?
[Sighs]
There's a doctor I know...
Very discreet.
Phone him and say Tony Bishara is calling in a favor.
Obviously, you're furious at me.
I'm hoping, in time...
Perhaps with some counseling, you could find it in your heart...
Could we discuss this once I've stopped bleeding?
Sure.
[Sighs]
What is it?
I saw you tonight.
With Tanya.
Oh.
Now, I could care less who you sleep with.
It makes no difference to me.
But just know Tanya's breasts are fake and she's had chlamydia twice.
Mrs. Taseltov means nothing to me.
Then why be with her?
Because...
I can't have who I really want.
Why not?
Well, this woman I'm interested in... is married, and I think if I ever told her how I really felt...
She'd be angry with me.
Maybe... this... woman...
Isn't happy.
Maybe her husband is falling apart and she is desperately in need of a strong man like you.
So... you think I should tell her how I feel?
As soon as possible.
And even though Alejandro was very famous, he never forgot where he came from.
When I turned 50, I had a big party, and he flew in all the way from Los Angeles just to see me.
Anyway...
[Voice breaking] ...I will miss him very much.
[Sniffles]
And now Carmen Luna would like to honor Alejandro with a musical tribute.
[Breathes shakily]
Hello.
I'm Carmen.
Alejandro was my mentor.
He taught me to believe in myself and to...
To pursue my dreams.
Alejandro, this is for you.
[Piano music plays]
[Music stops]
[Music resumes]
I'm sorry.
[Music stops]
Start again.
[Music resumes]
I r...
[Music stops]
I'm sorry.
[Sniffles]
[Voice breaking] He was so good to me.
[Sniffles]
I didn't realize I was gonna miss him so much.
[Crying]
That was the tribute he deserved.
_
She's been shot.
- What is this?
- Food for Jana.
- Hot dogs.
- Dog?
!
Who are you, the wolf whisperer?
The poison's gone.
Thank you.
Both of you.
I don't like her going back without us.
A pack with no leader has no centre, no direction.
They need to know I'm alive and returning soon.
Get off!
Rhydian?
!
Get off!
Come on!
Run!

Do you know what could have happened if you'd been caught?
Wolfbloods know how to hunt unseen.
That wasn't hunting.
That was stealing.
They were poaching.
Jana needs red meat.
She won't heal on scraps and human food.
So you just stole it?
- You have no right to judge us.
- Why, cos I'm not Wolfblood?
- Because we weren't the ones who were seen.
- What?
You were seen?
!
- For, like, two seconds.
- And he would have got caught if I didn't go back for him.
The only reason that farmer was there was because he was trying to catch you.
- What were you doing out there anyway?
- Okay!
Okay!
This isn't Tom's fault!
I was taking a shortcut, bringing this for Jana.
Maybe they could poach elsewhere, another farm, or...
No.
No.
Tom's right.
We're guests here.
We can't just go breaking rules that don't suit us.
We don't steal, not from anyone.
Your recovery could take months.
And what about your pack?
We've left them long enough.
We'll get by on what we can find in the woods.
It's like Rhydian thought the whole thing was my fault.
I think you're taking this a bit personally.
I can't find my planner.
All right, mate?
What?
Ah, my planner.
Where do you find that?
In my dad's field, where you left it.
I haven't been in your dad's field, Liam.
- Then how did it get there?
- Someone probably nicked it.
- You think I'm stupid?
- Get lost, Liam.
Whoa... what's going on?
My dad caught him poaching, sir.
What?
- In my field, last night.
- It wasn't me, sir!
- His dad saw him.
- How?
He's never even met me!
Look.
He found this!
Where were you last night, Tom?
Well, I was...
I was...
I was at...
He was with me!
- We went for a walk.
- Yeah.
Went through Liam's field.
Tom must have dropped his planner.
Why didn't he say that?
Because... we're going out.
I asked Tom not to say anything because, well... anyway, that's why.
That's quite enough melodrama for one day, wouldn't you say?
Sir?
Enough out of you, Liam.
Sit.
It's not real.
You can't believe everything you see in... films.
Come here.
Feel it.
See?
Harmless...
- What's it for?
- Fun.
But you're not doing anything.
Humans like making everything easy.
This is what you prefer, isn't it?
You don't need to be frightened of being comfortable, Aran.
This isn't comfort.
This place is a cage.
It's just until I'm better.
And this... this is so much easier.
Isn't it?
Easier if we don't poach... keep yourself weak, injured...
Let go.
Because then we can never leave, and that is what you want!
But you'd rather hide behind a crutch than admit it...
Much Ado About Nothing.
Act One Scene One.
Benedick and Beatrice.
When you get your scene, find a partner, play the parts.
How long do you think Shannon's been cheating on Harry?
Shannon?
She's a square.
Her and Tom have always been close though.
Maybe it just took poor Harry to make them realise how close.
Yeah, don't know a good thing until its gone.
Is that Shakespeare?
No, it's common sense.
Oh, for goodness' sake.
Katrina, pair up with Rhydian.
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick.
Nobody marks you.
What, my dear Lady Disdain...!
- Are you yet living?
- They're faking it.
Aw, is baby jealous?
Listen, leave him.
It's all an act.
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted.
And I would...
I could... finally...
No.
Those are my lines.
So was Shannon cheating on Harry?
What?
No.
So, when did they get together?
Uhm...
Afterwards?
A dear happiness to women.
I don't know, do I?
I thank God and my cold blood I am of your humour for that.
Feeling like the third heel?
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.
And I have no clue what you're on about, Shannon.
Benedick and Beatrice mock and snipe each other because they cannot admit they are in love.
These lines are filled with unspoken meaning.
Liam's not buying your act.
You think we want to be doing this?
Let's hope the new canteen's got better food than this.
Well, it can't get any worse.
This is totally pointless if you can't really convince Liam.
Well, what do you suggest, then?
You know... be more couple-y?
- Couple-y?
- You're the expert!
Had to be HIS farm.
- What are you doing?
- It's couple-y.
- You're clueless, aren't you?
- Come on...
See?
Said it'd be fun.
- Is he watching?
- Yeah.
He's watching.
This is epic.
Can we go somewhere?
Oh... my... days...
Tom...
Girls aren't allowed.
Get out!
Get out!
Come on, maybe in here.
You never answered the question.
Harry, I know how this looks and I am really sorry.
Were you two-timing me with Tom?
I didn't cheat on you, if that's what you mean.
Quick turnaround, though?
What do you want me to say?
Just be straight with us.
Please.
The truth, Shannon.
I want to tell you something.
But you have to swear.
You can't tell anyone.
What is it?
Last night, Tom was somewhere he shouldn't have been and I...
I gave him an alibi.
I told everyone we were together, and it sort of...
Sorry.
What?
Is that him?
Um...
Shannon?
No, Harry, wait.
The real truth is...
I am with Tom.
I'm sorry...
- So the other bit was just a lie?
- I just...
I didn't want you to think that I'd do something like that.
But you did.
He can't come in here!
I'm gone.
I'll tell Miss!
Harry...
Harry, please...
You massive creep!
Were you going to film us?
!
No!
I was...
I was...
Look.
Give it back.
What are the magic words?
Please?
Not quite.
Repeat after me.
- I...
- Liam Hunter...
I, Liam Hunter, promise never to spy in the girls' changing rooms again like a massive, creepy weirdo.
I wasn't spying!
And those weren't the magic words.
I, Liam Hunter... promise never to spy in the girls' changing rooms again...
Like a massive... creepy... weirdo.
That's the one.
Shan?
You Okay?
You wanted couple-y, so...
Sorry, Shannon.
You don't have to do this.
It's getting better.
Then we move on.
Tomorrow.
She can't travel yet.
She will get better in the wild.
The pack can hunt for her.
You forget yourself.
No, you forget.
You know what this place does.
You know what happens to Wolfbloods who stay too long.
Then go.
If you're so afraid of this place then leave.
Go!
Jana, don't be foolish.
He thinks I want to keep us here!
He's been fighting to leave ever since we arrived!
If I don't, you'll never get better.
You'll never go back!
A wild pack needs a wild leader.
I stay until I am healed.
You can do what you want.
I didn't risk my life to bring you here to watch you grow tame.
You send him back to Meinir, they will try to take the pack.
Aran is afraid, not disloyal.
I don't trust him.
He doesn't trust me
And are his fears unfounded?
I don't know.
You cannot expect Aran to know where your heart lies if you do not know yourself.
I will not betray the pack.
I know that.
Jana...
You adapt, you accept, and you embrace two worlds, but where I see open-mindedness,
Aran only sees vulnerability and danger.
Prove to him you know your mind, and he will trust it.
Will you go after him?
So, is she still a square, now?
No, just a cheat.
I didn't cheat!
I hope school isn't getting in the way of your social life, Shannon?
Look, I'm sorry, Okay?
You shouldn't have had to deal with this.
It was my decision.
But I should've dealt with it.
You should have talked to us.
Okay, everyone start packing up.
You all right?
- Oh!
- Oh.
- You know that thing, about...
- Going to the thing?
- To the thing.
Right, and then she said...
- Like I said.
- I can only get two asparagus because...
- Three is not around.
- What's happened?
- Mum...
Mum!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
Look out!
- Oh!
- Oh, great, well done.
I'm all right.
What are you even doing out here?
She came to find me.
I've every right to a say.
I've risked everything for our pack.
So has she.
You're all right?
Aran came to my aid.
You doubted my loyalty?
Do you still doubt mine?
I know what scares you, Aran.
It scared me too, once.
But tame...
Tame isn't something that just happens.
It's something we choose.
I choose our pack, and I chose you to get us home.
But if we don't trust each other, we won't make it.
Come back to the house.
I want trust.
Not allegiance.
Apparently, it's both greeting, and agreement.
What happened?
"Going out?"
Like... a couple.
We were just pretending.
Thanks...
I guess?
- You guys Okay?
- What is it?
Liam.
Tom!
Shannon!
I know you're in there!
Get down.
Tom?
Shannon?
I thought he believed you?
Look, just stay down, Okay?
He's not going to break in!
Jana!
Jana, no!
Jana?
- What happened to you?
- Come inside.
It was you that was in the trap.
I got it on camera.
It's your lot's been taking our lambs, isn't it?
It was me, Liam.
- Rhydian, don't...
- They didn't ask me to do it, and no-one else is going to take the fall for me.
You can't blame them.
Yes, I can.
I'm calling the police.
Our traveller's camp got raided.
That's where I got this.
We came here with nothing.
Rhydian was only trying to help us.
Please understand.
You can keep your sob story.
Hello, Emergency Services.
Which service do you require
- Hello?
- 'Repeat after me...'
You were spying on me?
Apparently you were spying on them.
Delete your evidence and this stays between us.
'...
Like a massive, creepy weirdo.'
- That's blackmail.
- Yeah.
Hand over the card, don't tell anyone they're here and this won't go online.
'...
Spy on the girls' changing rooms again, like a massive, creepy weirdo.'
If my dad catches you on our land again...
So, how's this going to work?
Just going to improvise.
I deleted the video.
That was your insurance.
I know, I just felt bad enough.
You and Shan stuck your necks out for me.
I let you down.
I'm sorry.
You should've just trusted us, you know?
Told us what was going on.
I didn't want you getting caught up in something we did.
We got caught up anyway.
Look.
Sorry, but you don't get to pick when me and Shan get involved.
You're stuck with us now, so.
I know.
And whatever it is, we'll help.
You just have to say.
You get involved whether I say it or not.
- Yeah...
- You deserve the same from me.
And here we go...
Just be cool.
Where were you?
!
I...
Paper round?
It's always the same with you!
Only on Tuesdays.
I am so done with this, Tom.
Shan, come on.
We never would have worked anyway.
Shannon, I'm sorry.
Shan!
I'm not going to hurt you!
You're not welcome here.
Enough!
My territory, my rules.
Is that true?
About Jana's staying at Maddy's place?
Victoria Sweeney doesn't come calling in the middle of the night for a friendly chat.
It is never gonna happen with my sister, OK?
Never.
What are you talking about, dude?
Steve did interfere with you guys.
We made a bet.
If Tom sleeps with you, he loses the car.
OK?
Tom just built this wall around his heart so that no-one else could get in, until...
Maggie?
Yeah, I was trying to work out if she was trying to warn me or encourage me.
I miss Rob.
Maybe we should just call things off.
I stuffed up.
I probably would have given the same advice.
We won't let this bastard get one cent from us.
How was the sex?
It was... nice.
Oh, nice?
I can't stop thinking about him which is why I was at the bar tonight.
Moving on?
Hoping someone else will cure me.
You... you want to hear that I had wild sex?
Well, it's about time, isn't it?
Miranda's guy from last night.
Is his name Carlos?
Is it someone that I know?
Why?
I just think you're making some pretty interesting choices.
Miranda?
Claire?
From the Tratt.
Yeah, I'm running late for a shift actually, so I'll see you later.
I'll get your usual ready for you.
Pfff...
Well...
Yeah, you must be tired.
Yeah.
It's been a big week for you Tom.
It's nice to see you at home.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, you're clearly on some childish ego trip.
OK.
Your phone's been running off the hook and it's like you're making up for lost time.
Oh, yeah?
And none of your "new friends" seem to be asked on a second date.
It's kind of despicable.
Actually, I'm going on a second date tonight.
It's FAT Night tonight.
We're going afterwards.
Good.
Isn't it?
See ya.
See ya.
Uh, Phoebe.
Colette!
Wait up!
Have you partnered up with anyone for the assignment?
Oh, no, I don't do groups.
Oh, brilliant introvert refuses to collaborate.
Yawn.
I'm sorry to bore you but I have a day job.
I can't just hang.
Partner with me.
I don't...
I don't know your work.
But you will, if we team up.
Come on.
It's more fun in a group.
Of two?
Is there any reason not to?
Probably a million, including I'm not ready to... collaborate with someone.
Why?
Because all your recent collaborations have been unsuccessful?
Well, look, I still want to be a groupie, so...
If you change your mind...
What's the difference between a lawyer and God?
God doesn't think he's a lawyer.
You can see why had to step down from my stand-up career.
What a big loss to the world.
Hey, this is perfect crackling, Rob.
So, um, this FAT Night thing is a competition?
What do you win?
A highly valuable wooden spoon.
Oh.
Sorry, guys, I've got to jet.
Aw...
But you're gonna miss the cheesecake.
Oh, you'll have to excuse Tom.
His one-night stand services are in high demand, apparently.
Man-whore.
No, I told you, this is a legitimate second date.
And... and what about the others?
We've second dates too.
All of them?
Yeah.
You're lying.
No, I'm not lying.
I have second dates lined up with all them.
Well, I'll be...
I'll be watching out, then.
OK.
As you like.
But, in the meantime, I'm running late for my second date so enjoy the cheesecake, ladies and gents.
Bye.
And that is vintage Coxy back on form.
Don't wait up.
Yeah.
Well, you don't have to share a flat with him.
It's his flat.
Yeah, I know, I was just saying.
Share house arguments.
I don't...
I don't miss those.
I just don't think that we have a right to judge Tom.
I mean, what he's doing is his business.
Oh, I was only stirring.
Well, your stirring sounded like judgement to me.
Since when is there anything wrong with bagging Tom?
Yeah, no, you're right.
It's a fair call.
Why don't you just say something?
Because I am with Nick and Carlos and Miranda's sex life has nothing to do with me.
Well, you were being a little narky.
I'm irrational.
OK, just shut up.
We going?
Yes, we are.
Alright.
Night.
Love you.
You too.
See you later, guys.
Thanks for coming.
Nice to meet you, Nick.
Was I... was I a bit harsh on Tom?
Nah, like I said, he's fair game.
Yeah, well, Grace obviously doesn't think so.
Hmmm.
Who knows?
PMS?
You guys are right on time.
The Korean models have just discovered there's a face-eating poltergeist living in the mirrors of their fashion house.
Oh, freaky.
I'm gonna crash.
Suit yourself.
There's more cereal in the fridge.
Um, no, thanks.
Face-eating poltergeists aren't really my thing.
It's times like these I miss Carlos.
That hot Brazilian loved a bit of Korean horror.
I'm gonna go to bed.
Night, Harry.
Night.
What did you expect?
The detective specifically told you not to look in the mirror.
Do you always have to floss so close to the mirror?
Yeah.
I like to see what I'm doing.
So do I and it's a little hard through all your tooth gunk.
What was that vibe tonight with Grace and Miranda?
Funny.
Not funny.
Hostile.
Alright, out with it!
There's nothing to tell.
Right.
So it's just Grace being neurotic as usual.
She's not neurotic.
Then what did Miranda do to deserve that attack?
Slept with Carlos, maybe.
What?
Tom knows.
That's how Grace heard.
Carlos?
Don't say anything.
Well, why haven't you asked her?
You should find out.
I haven't said anything to Miranda and I'm not going to.
Carlos?
Just...
Stay out of it.
So, what do you think of him?
Huh?
Nick.
A little bit up himself, don't you reckon?
I don't know.
Grace is happy, so...
Yeah, I guess.
Oh...
Old habits, huh?
I better go.
Yep.
Oh, um, we didn't really get a chance to talk tonight.
Do you... do you want a maybe grab a coffee or something tomorrow?
Or... or we could just catch up next FAT Night.
No.
That would... that would be good.
Huh?
But, won't Jade mind?
Uh... oh, Jade and I aren't, um...
Aren't what?
Uh, we're... we're done.
Sorry to hear.
Yeah.
But yeah, coffee sounds good.
Great.
Why don't you just text me?
Will do.
Text... you.
You're amazing.
You are.
Does it feel good for you?
Ah, yeah.
Yeah, that feels... that feels good.
Tell me when.
Oh...
Um... ah...
Ah, when, when.
Oh.
Yep, that's... that's good.
I'm done.
You sure?
Yeah.
You were quiet.
No, I'm...
I'm good, thanks.
Would you like to keep going?
Ah...
Like that?
Yeah, that's perfect.
Glad you could make it, Phoebe.
You know, I was a little surprised when you texted me.
I thought you might have been the kind of guy that never calls back.
No way.
Could I have a bite?
I can go get you one if you want.
I can't eat a whole one, silly.
Sorry.
Only child.
Wow.
Movie's starting.
Do you think he means it?
Answer it!
Tell him to meet us.
No.
Nup.
That's not happening.
OK, you can turn it off now.
Shhh.
That's really clever, making out like I'm the one that's causing the scene.
Just some cranky old man.
Just let it go.
They're cute.
It's a cinema, not the back seat of a school bus.
Shhh.
Hey!
Turn it off.
He's harassing us.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
Oh...
Oh, man, I'll tell you one thing,
I'm never drinking vodka from a shoe again.
Ugh.
Nothing good can come from it.
Livin' la vida loca, mate?
Lately you could say that.
Anyone I know?
Oh, just randoms mostly.
Is Miranda included in that?
Oh, yeah, we met up and drank and talked.
And?
And it was very nice.
Dude...
Did you or did you not sleep with my sister?
You know how wrong it is that you even asked me that question?
No, look, I don't want details.
I just want to know.
Because if you're using Miranda to hurt Grace, that is really not OK.
Yeah.
So, I know if there was anything actually going on, you'd tell me.
Why would I do that?
Well, because we're mates and she's my sister.
Hey.
If there's something going on, you should tell me.
You're an interferer.
A what?
OK, I'm going to be honest with you right now.
And you're not gonna like it.
I knew it.
Your sister wants to be with Tom.
Sorry?
And he wants to be with her too.
Wait, so you're saying that you and Miranda didn't do anything because she wants to be with Tom?
What I'm saying is that you've ruined it for those two by interfering.
I have a right to look after my sister.
But you don't have a right to make her sad.
You might think that you're protecting Miranda but what are you really doing is stopping her from being happy.
Come on.
So what if they did?
Grace left Carlos.
It's still not nice for her.
What if Miranda had slept with Rob?
She'd better not.
So...
Rob's single again.
That's confirmed.
I told you Grace saw them fighting at the barbecue.
Yeah, but it wasn't about me.
Oh, I'm not so sure that he's over you.
Ooh.
Oh, that's me.
Who's Will?
Um, a groupie from design class.
A groupie?
I'm just kidding.
What, is he hitting on you?
Oh, my God.
He is.
He's 20, so, no way.
He just wants to partner up for an assignment.
He's just being very persistent.
I think that's called horny.
Nothing's gonna happen.
I like his ideas.
Oh, ideas?
Really?
OK, so maybe he does have a crush.
At least I can tell.
Better than trying to figure out what's going on in Rob's head.
Morning.
Morning.
Hey, Harmony.
Miranda, hi.
Good to see.
You too.
You live with Tom, don't you?
Yeah.
Yep, he's my flatmate.
Such a free spirit.
Yeah.
Is he round at the moment?
I'm finding it a bit hard to get in touch with him.
Um, he's been a little bit hectic lately.
But, um, yeah...
He... he should be around.
Great, I'll keep trying, then.
OK.
Namaste, everyone.
Namaste.
Ben.
No, I haven't had a chance this morning.
What's in it?
When did this happen?
OK.
Yep.
OK.
No, I'll be there in 45.
OK.
What's happening?
They've refused the settlement.
What?
"See you in court."
Quote unquote.
It's already been leaked to the press.
Right.
Where are you going?
Well, I've got to go into the office and figure out how to extricate us from this shit.
Janelle, get in contact with their lawyers, set up a conference call for 10.
Just wait.
I'll get ready.
That's not necessary.
It's our case.
Is that the one in the breaking news about the $6 million lawsuit?
I can deal with this.
I can locate every document.
You're gonna need my help.
No.
I needed you not to have published the story in the first place.
That would have been helpful.
That would have been helpful.
You said that you would have done the same and you said that they would settle.
Yeah, well, I guess we were both wrong.
Just hold on.
No, you're not.
Nice guy.
I mean, what would Tom have in common with a yoga teacher?
Flexibility.
OK, besides that.
Focus, stamina.
OK, OK, I got it.
Thanks for helping out with this.
That's OK.
I figure if I want people to take me seriously,
I need a portfolio with actual stuff in it.
Hey, do you think Rob has broken up with Jade because he's missing you?
I doubt it.
All I'm saying is now he's got it out of his system and that's probably why he's asked you out on this date.
It's not a date.
It's just a friendly used to be married, now separated catch up.
Well, that's the last of it.
Hey, hey, hey.
Who am I?
"Ooh, yeah, Robbie!
Do me in the bushes."
You know you were born with a missing chromosome, right?
Sorry, mate.
Slipped out.
And then back in again.
Well, laugh all you want, you idiots, but for your information, that's all done with.
That's a shame.
She's a bit of a spunk, mate.
Yeah, she was, but I wasn't prepared to go to jail for a killer rack.
Go grab the tools, mate.
Make yourself useful.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, my date last night was a...
It was a write-off.
Really?
Oh.
Just not feeling it.
Well, mate, the human brain is a weird piece of circuitry.
Mm.
You just can't flick off the switch.
Hang on.
One more thing for the tip.
Did you lock up?
Yes, Mum.
You can't throw that out.
That's in good nick.
It's just the legs.
The rest of it's busted.
Keys, Coxy?
Great.
"BMG incompetence ends in court" Hey, you got a mention.
This is bad.
You're gonna need a disguise.
Or a new job.
Nick obviously doesn't respect my professional capabilities.
He's got NPD.
Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
He doesn't have NPD.
Remember how with Carlos, you wanted me to be the invisible man?
Yeah.
Well, with Nick, I don't even have to try.
I don't exist.
I won't lie, that hurts my feelings, but I'm more worried about you.
OK.
I said it.
Nick!
I need to know what's going on.
Can't brief you.
I've got an emergency meeting with them.
Well, is there any news?
Not yet.
Look, you don't need to be here.
I want to stay in the loop.
Nick!
Thanks so much, Maggie.
I'll bring it back this afternoon.
Oh, there's no hurry.
Oh!
Oh, and I won't break it.
Don't worry.
I don't need any more bad luck.
Oh.
Well, you can bring it back at lunch, anyway.
Lunch?
Tom didn't mention it?
No.
No, he didn't.
Oh, maybe he forgot.
Yeah, or maybe he would rather bring one of his many, many other friends.
OK.
See ya.
You right there?
Yep.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I am a very bad son.
I'm a very bad son with a movie date.
A date?
Yeah.
With whom?
With ummm...
Just a girl.
Are you not telling me her name because you don't remember it?
I understand from Miranda that you've been a little busy lately.
Well, my date is none of your business.
Or Miranda's.
Darling, what happened?
After Kristen, I thought you were evolving.
Mm-hm.
I've evolved.
And now I'm into a new phase.
Right, well, maybe we could discuss this new phase over a coffee this afternoon?
I need to talk to you about going to see Mum's solicitor.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm meeting another friend after.
Well, dinner, then.
And invite Miranda.
Also busy.
Well, could you at least tell Miranda she's invited this time?
I will.
How was yoga?
Great.
Sure you don't want one?
Oh, no, thanks.
I don't want to spoil lunch.
Oh.
I don't think I'll have time for lunch.
I've got another thing to go to.
But this is still good, yeah?
Yeah.
It's meant to be a cracking film.
So this is it?
Movie then sex?
Sorry.
It's starting.
You know, if you didn't want to talk to me, you could have just been honest.
Shh.
Did you just shush me?
What's wrong with you?
Hm?
Congratulations.
This is officially the worst date ever.
Don't go!
Melody!
It's Harmony!
I'm not an interferer, am I?
*
I'd spoke to Carlos about Miranda.
- Oh, Steve!
- He didn't give me the answer anyway.
Good!
He said, I've ruined Miranda's chance at happiness... with Tom.
Which was I said to you and you've ingnored me.
Yeah... well.
Maybe you're right.
*
It's just...
After dad left us... it was my job to protect Miranda.
I didn't see it as interfering.
It's not called interfering.
That's over-functioning.
Well, I think I over-functioned things up.
Maybe.
But your heart was in the right place.
If I stuffed things for her, I really should fix it.
No!
So, how do you think Steve got that idea?
Well, he knew we hung out the other night, so...
Yeah, so he just automatically assumes that we...
You know what your brother's like.
You know, I did tell Tom that I shagged someone.
As a joke.
Oh, my God!
Do you think that's why Grace has been mad at me?
She thinks that we slept together.
Mmm.
What?
Do you not even care what she thinks?
Why should I care?
I mean, we're finished.
She should give you more credit.
Or ask you before she judges.
Yeah, that's true.
This is work.
Oh.
I have to go soon.
See you.
OK.
See you.
Miranda!
Hey, Claire.
Can I get you another coffee?
No, I'm...
I'm actually fine, thank you.
That was weird, bumping into you at yours.
I knew you and Tom were friends, but I had no idea you lived together.
Uh, yeah.
Have you... have you heard from Tom?
Yeah, I called him, so we're catching up.
Tonight?
Yeah, we're going to the movies.
Oh, great.
Hey, can you tell me, is Tom seeing anyone else?
If you know something I should know then I wanna know it.
Oi!
Hey, mate.
What's doin'?
Can I ask you something?
What do you think about Tom and Miranda?
Well, let me get the ice-cream.
We'll do this properly, huh?
Seriously, if she was your sister, would you stop her from seeing Tom?
Depends if I was gonna win a car or not.
Ta.
Look, if you want my honest opinion, it was pretty obvious from day dot that those two had it bad for each other.
I think that's why Tom stayed single for so along.
Not just a dry spell?
I don't think Tom knows what a dry spell is.
Mm.
So, in my opinion, yeah.
You probably did crap all over their happiness.
Thanks, man.
Any time.
So, what are you making?
Oh, it's just some junk I salvaged from the site.
Oh, recycling, eh?
Dani would approve.
Yeah, it's nothing, really.
It's just...
You better not be checking me in.
OK.
Well, you know I hate that.
I know, I know.
It's the digital age.
It's all very scary.
Alright, Bieber, hurry up and show me your design concept.
I have a date this afternoon.
Oh, really?
Alright, look, so it's all just some really basic modelling at this stage, but, you know, you'll get the idea.
Just here.
Thanks.
Oh, you call this basic modelling?
Yeah.
Every time I think you might be intelligent, you go and do something like take a photo of your food.
Hi.
Hey.
How are ya?
Good.
What... what's going on?
Didn't we have a date?
Six girls in a week?
Dick move, Tom.
Dick move.
Don't bother coming in when I'm working.
You won't get served.
Harmony.
Hey, I'm so sorry about...
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
You weren't out of alignment.
No.
No, I'm sure even Buddha lost it sometimes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, no, yeah.
That's...
That's plenty of time.
OK.
I'll see you in 20 minutes.
OK, bye.
Thought you were going home?
Oh, I wanted to wait.
There's nothing to brief you on.
Their lawyers haven't filed anything new.
They just rejected the settlement.
That doesn't make any sense.
Well, I'm sure it'll all become pretty clear in court.
You know, we were stupid to think that they wouldn't see it through in the first place.
We weren't stupid.
Not when they agreed...
What were you thinking?
Sorry?
Grabbing my arm like that in front of Ben?
Uh, I didn't see him.
Well I just spent the last half hour convincing him we're not sleeping together.
And that is the last fuckin' thing I need right now.
God, I needed that swim.
Just to wash that horrible off.
It was mortifying.
I mean, I couldn't believe that I had actually put myself in that position.
Or that he was actually saying those things!
I can't believe you didn't tell him where to go.
Yeah...
This is exactly like when Mrs Benedict found out that I was one that stuck the candle up St Francis's nose.
I don't like getting in trouble, especially not from people that I feel vulnerable to.
This is his other side.
Oh, come on.
No-one is that charming.
It would be really annoying to get fired for sex that isn't even that great.
Really?
No, I mean...
But... but it's just not...
Carlos?
It's like he's performing the role of the world's greatest lover, but he is trying so hard that he's not even there.
Oh, some guys take a while to let their guard down.
This is like he's having sex with himself!
Well, he is very attractive.
Mm.
Look, if he's treating you badly and the sex isn't great,
I don't know what you're staying for.
Oh, no, he's not treating me badly.
I mean, well, not until today.
I dunno.
I dunno.
Maybe you're right.
If it wasn't for me, do you honestly think you and Tom would have worked?
Well, we'll never know now, will we?
You holding it against me?
Which part?
The part where you had the bet, the part where you hid it from me, or the part that you told me the way you did it?
So, you are holding it against me?
No, not really.
It... it doesn't matter anymore.
You in love with Tom?
We're flatmates.
That's all.
Hey.
Hey.
The bet was a bad idea.
Yeah.
I think we're all in agreeance...
It was stupid and immature and it's caused a whole lot of trouble.
I agree with everything you're saying, but...
No, can you just let me finish, please?
I need to say this.
OK.
Look, we've been mates for a long time.
Yeah.
Yep?
And I've seen things in this apartment that I won't soon forget.
OK?
No matter how hard I try.
Mm-hm.
But if you can tell me that your intentions are honest...
Hey, there's no towel in the bathroom.
Oh, yep.
Sorry.
No, that's OK, that's OK.
Hey.
Sorry!
It's OK.
It's OK.
I have to go.
Oh, good chat.
Yeah, good chat.
Good chat.
It's Nick.
Thanks for that.
Um, I've found a precedent.
It turns out that even if they take us to court that...
It's over.
Well, no, it's not.
Here, listen.
Grace, it's done.
They were bluffing.
They want double the negotiated settlement fee.
And did they get it?
Not all of it.
You'd done a great job tying the agreement down, so... ..good news.
OK, well, thanks for telling me.
Look, I'm sorry if I seemed harsh before.
I mean, I'd love to shout it out from the rooftops, but keeping its low-key at work protects us both.
Grace?
You're not nice to Harry.
Sorry?
Bye.
I was wondering if you could replace this light out the back this afternoon.
Ooh, you're otherwise engaged.
Yeah, sorry, I've been on a bit of a roll with this thing, you know?
That's looking great!
It's getting there.
Where are you gonna put it?
It's not for me.
Oh.
Well, whoever ends up with it is gonna love it.
Um, sorry to rush you, but I actually have to go.
OK.
OK.
They're not finished, or very good.
No, no, no.
What are you talking about?
This is... this is awesome.
You're just being nice.
No, I'm being serious.
Look, the curvature of this globe, it's... it's beautiful.
Look, you take charge and we'll combine the best of both our designs.
Alright.
Yes?
We'll give it a go.
Yes?
Yeah.
Alright!
This needs to be commemorated.
Oh, my God!
Put it away!
No, come on.
It's just one.
It's an experiment, right?
Oh, easy, tiger!
That's pretty hot, right?
I'm putting a rule on this group situation.
Mm-hm.
No more selfies.
Deal.
Running late as usual, Mr Duffy?
No, no, that's cool.
No, I understand.
You have to take the work.
Absolutely.
We can do it another time.
Yep, it was just casual.
OK.
Alright.
Bye.
I come bearing gifts.
Well, you didn't have to do that.
Oh, you don't want chicken rice paper rolls?
Nobody said that.
That's heaps!
Yeah, well, it's for everyone.
Is Harry here?
Harry!
Nick?
I think I've found something you might be interested in.
It's a vintage radio.
Replica.
Yeah, but these speakers are a million times better than the old ones.
I can't accept it.
No, I don't...
I don't want the thing, trust me.
It's yours.
OK, thanks.
Hey, do you want some?
Nick's bought enough to feed an army.
Well, cyclists need their carbs, right?
Yeah.
Inviting Carlos to dinner is my way of apologising for you sticking your nose in.
I'm just gonna hope that he didn't sleep with Miranda.
Me too.
For Grace's sake.
I really haven't made much of an effort to talk to him since they broke up.
So I went to see Tom this afternoon.
What is wrong with you?
No, I went to give him my blessing, with Miranda, but it turns out I was interrupting him hooking up with someone else.
And in the end, I couldn't do it.
What part of "it's not all about you"
do you still think is all about you?
So what am I meant to do?
Nothing.
Yeah?
Hi, it's me!
Oh, hi!
Oh...
Oh, just put it by the wall there, darling.
Oh, OK.
Thank you so much.
It was perfect for the shoot.
Oh, I'm glad I could help!
Yeah.
Did you speak to my son today?
Ah, no.
No, I didn't.
I told him to pass on an invite for dinner.
Oh.
Um...
Thanks, though, but I've actually got to race.
I want to get some work done before Tom gets back.
So...
I'm guessing you decided not to take my advice?
Um, what advice was that?
To give Tom a second chance.
Sorry.
That was...
I...
I...
I thought you were trying to warn me off him.
No!
Oh, really?
Did I muck that up?
Oh, I should never have got involved.
It's OK.
Um...
Tom's obviously moved on and... ..so have I.
So... see you.
OK.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, hello!
Yeah, you tracked down Tom?
I did, yeah.
I'll see you in class, then.
Namaste.
Namaste.
Hey!
You hungry?
I can make two.
Mm, no, thanks.
I'd rather not catch anything.
Oh, don't be like that.
How many was that today, Tom?
Hm?
Are you trying to set some land speed record or something?
You might not agree with whatever it is you think I'm doing, but I don't have to explain it to you.
No, you don't, but you do have to take other people's feelings into account.
You know, I have to see that woman every day.
A bit of a double standard, don't you think?
I have to see Carlos too.
Oh, my God.
You're way off.
Am I, really?
Because the last you told me, you were having wild sex with someone.
So I don't really know where I'm getting confused there.
No, I was just saying that to wind you up because you were so out of line.
No, I saw the text from Carlos...
No!
..so I know for a fact that you spent the night with him.
I didn't...
No, no, don't, don't...
Don't... don't... don't even bother.
OK?
I don't care.
You do whatever you want.
But I do think you need to consider Grace in this, because what you're doing is very low.
OK, Carlos and I, we're friends.
We spent the whole night talking.
Oh...
You can just go and fuck yourself, Tom.
If you have the time.
Oh, I can do that.
No, Nick.
He who pays for takeaway does not clear up.
Good rule.
So...
Hmm...
Is this where you tell me I'm an arsehole?
I don't know.
Are you an arsehole?
OK.
Full disclosure.
Bianca is threatening to go for full custody of Cleo and it's been doing my head in a bit.
I can't afford to piss Bianca off, and today, it just...
It tipped me over.
I'm sorry.
I understand.
And now you've seen my ugly side.
Is it goodbye?
No.
No, I think it's kind of a relief to know that you're human.
Well, if it's issues you're after... ..you're in for a treat.
Show me.
I'm a tool.
And I can't believe that I was so stupid I missed the sarcasm.
Keep going...
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.
Yeah, well, it really isn't any of your business, anyway.
Yeah, well, there's that as well.
I wanna make it up to you.
So... ..you feel like coming to the movies?
Yeah, no.
I can see how in the context of today's events that could seem a little insensitive, but I got a couple of tickets from earlier, and I just thought you might feel like forgiving me and coming along.
No, thanks.
Miranda...
I'm sorry for disappointing you.
Constantly.
And... ..I'm sorry for...
I'm just sorry.
Sorry.
Turning it on silent.
Switch it off, wanker.
Hey, take it easy, dude.
Oh, come on!
Subtitles brought to you by The Foxy Team @Viki
Did you or did you not say that I'd go to my previous husband's company to bleed shares and make a commotion?
!
I did!
So what?
But why is it you ahjumma?
Are you even the previous wife of of that company's president?
Are you even the previous wife?
!
That's right!
I am the previous wife of that President.
What do you want to do about it?
Jeong Woo.
You came?
Over there.
Ae Ra.
Over here.
He's here.
I'm called Cha Jeong Woo.
Ok, then...
You've both resolved your misunderstandings.
The treatment cost,
Na Ae Ra's side has agreed to pay them.
You've all agreed, right?
Know that your luck is good.
I'm only enduring this because I'm an intellectual.
Who should be saying that.
Aigoo, really!
Shall we start again?
Since it's all finished now, you can all return (home).
Mr. Cha Jeong Woo also.
Yes.
President.
You divorced well.
Is that really the president of DT Soft Venture?
I didn't know that it really was.
But why didn't he give her consolation compensation?
Listen.
Because you came when you were busy...
I hope that I never see you again for this kind of matter.
That's the same for me.
Be careful so that some strange rumor doesn't make the rounds.
Why?
!
Fine.
Then let's decide to live being careful of each other.
I should have just gone to jail.
What?
It's nothing.
What is it?
!
I...thought she'd be very pretty.
Your previous wife.
She was pretty.
Back then, she was considered the Madonna of the Exam Village.
Oppa, why do you eat kimchi stew everyday?
Huh?
You always come alone and eat.
You must not have any friends.
Because I don't have any friends studying for the examinations.
You don't even go to law school, do you?
No.
Science and Engineering.
You came out of a school for Science and Engineering and why do you study?
Can you take the examinations even if you graduate for Science and Engineering?
I'm preparing for technical examinations.
Is there something like that?
Well, study diligently.
Then not only was her face pretty, but her heart was pretty, too.
She believed in me more than anyone else, too.
But after I failed at business the person completely changed.
Hey, honey.
Honey, I am cold.
Your husband will freeze to death.
Yoboya('Hun=Honey' in Korean)
Hun~
Honey.
Honey!
(using respectful speech)
Hon...
Hon...
That's what happened.
Is that why you didn't give her any consolation compensation?
What do you mean I didn't?
She is the one who refused to.
You don't know what she did at the end.
What do you want me to do about the alimony?
Do you even have the money to give?
I put my office out (on the market).
If I move outside, it still won't be much money.
It's fine.
How many cents are you trying to give me?
I won't take that kind of thing, so don't contact me using that consolation compensation as an excuse.
Just quietly buzz off from my life
Quietly, buzz off from my face.
I should of said it to her!
Now that I hear your story,
I'm really becoming afraid to get married.
Oh, but your previous wife, she saw how you looked today, so about right now, she'll probably be striking the ground and regretting it.
Not at all.
He wasn't sorry at all.
You saw it too, right?
If he went around spreading those false rumors, at the very least, "I'm sorry.
It's a misunderstanding."
Shouldn't he have had the sincerity to make those kinds of apologies?
Hey.
There's no proof that Jeong Woo went around saying those things.
I mean, Jeong Woo isn't even the type of person to say that sort of thing.
There must have been some kind of misrepresentation.
Did you ever see smoke where there's no fire?
He must have gone around dripping something for that kind of rumor to be around.
Hey, but how did you know Jeong Woo's phone number and call it?
I called his old number and he just answered it.
He didn't change his number.
I went around looking like this?
Oh, I must be crazy.
Oh, you should have told me.
Maybe..
He was waiting for your phone call?
!
Are you crazy?
I haven't even committed a crime, so why change my number?
All right.
Why are you getting so upset?
I was just asking.
Like a person that has feelings left...
Feelings left?
Earlier when she called I didn't even know who it was and answered it.
If I knew would I have answered it?
!
All right.
All right.
I erased her from my memory a long time ago.
She is the ERROR in my life, the MISTAKE.
The worst mistake in my life!
Who should be saying that.
Let's be careful of each other as we live.
Who is warning whom?
But still if you see how he came running in the middle of the night saying that he's your previous husband,
Jeong Woo is a person that has loyalty.
Loyalty, my a**.
Then should he not come?
Of course he should have come.
He would die (if he didn't).
He could not come if he made up his mind not to.
There's nothing that says that he absolutely has to come.
Do you by chance...
You don't still think that Jeong Woo can't move a muscle without your approval, do you?
Huh?
When Jeong Woo was coming into the Police Station earlier, his aura was just...
Oh, he became a person that we can't even hope to look at.
Hey.
Why are you taking Cha Jeong Woo's side since earlier?
Are you Cha Jeong Woo's friend or are you my friend?
No, I just...
When I saw Jeong Woo, I felt like it was such a waste.
There's nothing to feel wasteful about.
I'm going to become 'more, more , more, more,' better than him.
With what?
How are you going to become 'more, more, more, more, more' better than him?
That seems difficult, realistically.
Truthfully what do you and I have to look at?
As we get older men are more cunning.
They calculate things you see and don't see so carefully, and they never "do a business that loses money."
Even when that doctor said that he liked you, something seemed a little sticky (off).
Your words have thorns in them.
What?
That's what you're saying. 'A seemingly perfect man that has everything,' 'why should he look at you?
' That's what you're saying.
No, I just realistically...
That's enough, wench.
Where are you going?
That punk's temper.
Bad wench.
While she can't even comfort me, she's turning on the air conditioning in a heart with a hole in it.
What is it?
She's not even following me out.
Oh, that bad wench.
but where do I go?
I heard that the dry cleaner ahjussi is getting remarried?
He's not getting remarried, but he's getting back together with his previous wife.
The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.
After he split from her and dated this woman and that woman, he realized that his previous wife was still better.
The woman too realized that it was hard to live alone after divorcing...
That's true...
Even a bad husband is better to have.
A bad husband?
Hey, the dry cleaner ahjussi is such a rich man.
And after they divorced, the multihousing unit he'd bought got redeveloped and the land value jumped up ten times in value.
He's a right proper rich guy.
It could've been a really big deal.
She might have lost that kind of husband.
And on top of that, just like things are better after it rains, their married couple relationship got so much better.
These days they close the shutters at the drop of a hat.
"They're making rice cakes."
It's not easy for a person to break that connection.
The person with experience is better than one without?
Come to your senses.
You're not in your right mind right now.
The businessman selected this time was CEO Cha Jeong Woo of D T Soft Ventures.
At this time, D T Soft Venture's stock value is estimated to be over 1 trillion won.
There are about 30 million mobile members.
And the fact that the numbers are increasing played a big role in the award selection.
CEO Cha, who has caused a whirlwind in a saturated mobile texting companies...
What is this?
So why did you break up when he was poor?
You should split up when he's rich.
The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.
He was a rich man.
I'm called Cha Jeong Woo.
I hope something like this doesn't happen again.
But he acted so cold.
At the police station, he was definitely cold.
They say that Tiger Woods gave his ex-wife 20 Million dollars consolation compensation.
Well that was because Tiger Woods had his own troublesome reason.
Anyway, the length of the marriage, cause for the divorce, one's wealth, among other things well, it changes according to those things, but...
I don't have that kind of troublesome reason.
She hasn't contributed in any way [financially].
Hey, a man can't say two things with one mouth.
Didn't you say so at your last interview?
The person who made you grit your teeth determined to succeed.
That if it wasn't for thay person, you wouldn't be as successful as you are today.
You said that.
That person was yesterday's previous wife.
It's true, isn't it.
Ah, really.
Every word that I say is just right.
I'm definitely capable.
I have something to say.
Make some time.
Cha Jeong Woo.
Fortunately I'm ok today (to meet).
No, then it seems like I was waiting for him to call all this time.
What do you want to tell me?
See me today.
Where shall we meet?
I'll go to your company.
Luckily,I havesomethingtotake care ofin Gangnam.
I'll go to your company.
Okay.
Wait...
Then this is not the time to be like this...
Hey!
I'm sorry.
Yes.
You be careful of catching a cold too, Manager.
Oh wow.
Unnie, your acting is the best.
How can you act so well?
Your face is pretty too.
You should have become a talent.
When I was very pretty (younger) I couldn't go about Gangnam properly.
Every time I took a step forward I received a business card from a contract company.
It was so annoying that I couldn't even walk around.
If went to the city once I could play cards with the business cards (I collected).
Unnie, you must have totally been so popular.
But it looks like you have an important meeting today to be exaggerating to your company like this and go.
Yes.
It's a very important appointment.
Where is the nearest department store?
Representative, you have a guest.
Call them in.
Have a seat.
Is this your office?
It's nice.
This way.
Oh, what time did you say the lecture was for Seoul University?
This afternoon at 4 O'clock, Sir.
Tell Driver Kim to ready the car by 3pm.
Okay.
They say that I got chosen as the CEO that college students most respect.
They're asking me to lecture.
And that to a person that doesn't have speaking ability.
That's good.
Your junior must be proud of you.
Well, I can't say that isn't so.
Thank you for yesterday at the police station.
For coming when you would've been busy.
It's fine.
That could happen.
However... what is it you wanted to tell me?
I was surprised at the text.
Surprised?
After the ruckus you caused, you didn't think of that?
The reason I asked you to come see me,
The consolation compensation.
Anyway, it bothered me.
I should have finished it after giving you what I should have.
As you know at that time I didn't have the experience or the means.
After speaking to a lawyer I put in what is the generally accepted amount.
Of course there's no reason to give you what you said you wouldn't accept, but the woman that you are, like last night I don't when you might make another commotion like that again.
Rather, I thought that giving it to you would set my mind at ease.
You called me to say that?
Yes.
Ah, and this.
It's a confirmation document.
Contract
Saying that you won't contact me again using the consolation compensation as an excuse or threat.
I thought it would be good to write one.
Cha Jeong Woo, you've really grown.
A contract?
Why?
Why don't you ask me to write you an apology/repentance letter?
Am I some kind of gold digger?
To write this kind of contract and rip off your money?
You...
I don't know how much you put in this envelope, but no matter how much money you put in it's not enough.
If I think of my life that went wrong because of you, even a billion isn't enough.
Do you know?
So, don't look at a person laughably with a few bucks.
And also, I was thankful to you for yesterday.
That's why I came.
Not because I had a different reason.
A contract?
This bastard.
Ae Ra, have you heard the news about Husband Cha?
Oppa?
I came in yesterday.
Anyway, that isn't important.
Do you know your ex has become really big?
Hey, don't be surprised.
Cha Jeong Woo's become totally rich.
DT Soft Ventures,
WHY?
!
Oppa, what trouble are you trying to get in?
Why, why, why.
-This temper of hers.
-Why are you asking that?
What did you do now?
!
Ah, really!
Why did you call her?
What's so good about the news?
While Husband Cha was becoming a Chaebol (wealthy conglomerate family) what were we doing?
This is why I can't leave the house for a minute.
While I was in Vietnam, you didn't call Husband Cha once, did you?
Why should I call a person that's already split off from us?
Only heartache would come of it.
This is why it's a problem.
Even lights that are out should be looked at again and broken couples have to think to be put back together again.
Aiyoo, is this something I have to step forward with?
You take care of yourself.
You said that the business in Vietnam was going well, but why did you so suddenly come back?
That's a top secret for the business.
Anyway, I'll tell you slowly.
Don't ask.
Why do you kill a boy's spirit?
Did you come back from the health club?
Your body looks good!
The women of this neighborhood go around saying that they want to touch my muscles...
I had to cut them right off and tell them that I was Soo Cheol's man.
You're funny.
And Father, you've really aged while I wasn't here.
Your hair got so white.
Sit down.
Because of that these days
I just don't feel like living anymore.
I wonder why I'm living like this.
I don't know if the critical stage of my life has come.
Only tears just keep coming out.
Ah, it's fine.
If you do a hair transplant, you won't even notice.
Father, it's going to be your 60th birthday very soon, you can do it as a commemoration.
I should, right?
Of course.
Even so, I looked into a place that does it for cheap...
I have no money.
Soo Cheol.
Really...
It's clothes I haven't seen before.
I went to meet someone.
Who?
Cha Jeong Woo.
Jeong Woo?
Yes.
When?
Today?
Yes.
I just met him.
Why, why?
Did he by chance call you to ask you about the police station matter?
What did he say?
There a lot of words back and forth.
If I tell you, it's a long story.
Can I sit down and tell you about it?
Yes, of course!
Let's sit down and talk.
You didn't accept that money?
I have my pride.
I can't accept it while even writing a contract.
If he was begging on his hands and knees and fairly raising it up to me I don't know.
Isn't that so?
That is true...
Even so, you should have seen how much it was.
I thought I'd waver if I saw it, so I didn't look.
You know so too.
That I'm weak when it comes to money.
That is true...
What?
Why the disappointed face?
No.
Disappointment...
Is your friends pride important or is the money important?
Did I say anything?
Then don't make that face.
I'm regretting it anyway.
You did well, girl!
A Memorandum?
What memorandum?
My insides all all relieved.
Really?
Hey, you eat too.
This girl...
You eat!
The apple is delicious.
Where did you buy it from?
How have you been?
(Informal)
Yo. (Formal ending)
Talk comfortably.
Shall I?
Seeing you here, you look completely different.
Your pathetic look...
I mean that prestigious look is still about you, and
You've become very bright.
How have you been doing?
Me?
Well, I've been busy...
I was outside (the country) doing business.
That's why I only found out about your success.
If I knew earlier, I would've come much faster!
Sorry for the late congratulations.
You understand, right?
Yes.
I was going to call you anyway.
Call?
Me?
Yes.
Ten, hundred, thousand, hundred thousand, a million!
Hallelujah.
Hallelu...
Oh my.
Are you okay?
Let go.
Get up please.
I said to let go of me.
You don't talk about losing.
You won.
Like you said, Represenataive Cha isn't an ordinary man.
I almost actually came on to him.
Anyway, A bet is a bet so
Jae Woo is yours now.
Are you going back to America tomorrow?
If I go I'm not going to come back in for a little while.
Let's live calling each other.
I'm not sure.
Were we that close?
But still we were college roommates in our day.
How can you disappear so suddenly like that?
Undersecretary of State [for Economic Affairs]...
I heard he's going out for the election.
To assist in his election,
I sent him something.
Thank you.
And also,
I don't need the horse.
You don't have to give him to me.
Seeing how President Cha would come out,
I was really quite curious.
I got the answer that I wanted.
Bitch...
Did you have to change your major like that?
Couldn't you have just done it as a hobby?
Well,
I must take after mum.
Father, are you really angry at me?
You wouldn't kill your only son, right?
I might not kill you, but you may get hit almost til to the point of death.
If it weren't for you,
There was no problem.
You know.
If he found out through some other route then I...
Hey!
Where are you going?
When Noona gets off work, I'll come home with her.
Any way I look at it, it seems like it'll go better if Noona is there.
I won't run away, so don't worry!
Hey, man.
Then, I'm the one who'll bite the bullet.
Don't you think of me?
Aish, this brat.
Noona.
When are you getting off work?
It's fine.
I'll wait.
Me?
I have a lot of things to do.
Hello.
These- return these right now.
Who is Na Ae Ra here?
You.
Not long ago you went to ChungPyeon, right?
Sorry?
-It's not that.
-You...
I heard you're divorced.
Why?
While shaking your tail at another man, were you divorced?
No!
Look here!
Shaking my tail?
That I went there is correct, but
I really didn't know anything-
You, get your head on straight and live.
A young thing trusting only in her body, don't play around.
I put it in calculating until the end of the month.
There's nothing good if rumors start, so I'd appreciate it if you left right away.
Manager, it's unfair.
I got a call from the President.
That woman form earlier is President's friend.
Manager!
Hey, why won't you answer your phone?
-what is it?
-You got off work already, right?
I'll go to the front of your shop now...
No, don't come.
It's something good.
Anyway, don't come.
I've gone.
Okay.
Hey, at that time you said you'd like to quit your job, and run a store, right?
This Oppa will make it happen.
I'm fine, but thank you.
Father!
You punk!
Ah, ah, father.
Father!
Okay, hit me all you like.
Just not my face.
If I get hurt in the face Mom will worry.
I have to video call with Mom.
Hey, you punk!
I know I deserve to get hit in this situation.
I admit it, so hit me anywhere but my face.
How dare you not listen to me and run around!
How can I live?
!
You have to at least leave a hole for this father to breathe through?
!
Wow, was I the hole that you breathed through?
I feel emotional but at the same time suddenly burdened...
Noona!
You damn punk!
Did you come together?
Anyway, you take responsibility for Yeo Jin, and you make your brother a person!
Have him frequent the company too and watch him too.
That I make him a person, would I be filled in your eyes?
Noona, I toured around Central and South America.
She's a girl I dated in Cuba.
And she's a girl I met at Samba Festival in Brazil named Pricilla.
And this is my friend from college.
They got married in Mexico.
They married within one week of meeting.
These kids, while I was taking their pictures, the kids there...
Mom is well, right?
Yeah.
I think she's gotten a lot better since she went to Paris.
But, sis, call mom.
Would she be happy to hear from me?
How's our master (tutor)?
Is he doing well?
You couldn't refuse the request of the company's investor, and you picked that son as a Nakasan.
(Nakhasan, meaning parachute ~Nepotism)
It's a disappointment Hyung.
Even if Father said something you should have cut him off.
I was only trusting in you.
It's not because I received the request.
I Ok'd it because you had potential.
Aiyoo, if you say it like that then...
That's true.
I did have some smarts since I was young.
Because I taught you well.
Who was the tutor that taught a naive middle schooler about alcohol?
Who was the passionate middle schooler that was enraptured with a naive college student?
At that time the soju was an anesthetic to you.
You calmed down a little after you learned soju from me.
I admit it.
At that time I was a little immature.
It's a relief that I met you then Hyung.
Cheers.
But hyung, over there that woman
She keeps looking at me since earlier.
What do I do?
She's looking at me.
It's me.
I'm telling you it's me.
She was looking at me all along since I got here and was waiting for you.
Ai, really.
Argue something you should.
Do you want to make a bet?
Deal.
Why?
You're trembling because it's the first time you've seen a celebrity, huh?
Omo, so cute.
Oh, I...
The thing is...
The gentleman would like to have a drink with you.
Who?
Picking up women this way,
It's childish.
Then, DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T DO THAT.
First, sit down.
Oh, really.
Aiyoo, sit still.
You're so shy for a man.
Oh, seriously.
Why is your skin so soft?
Oh hey, you're good looking.
It's been a long time.
Wait.
Hyungnims.
Hyungnims.
Hyungnim.
Why do you keep asking me to dig the ground?
Your tension building tact is quite heavy.
That's enough.
Stop.
Ah.
Ah yes.
He's going to sleep.
Cover him.
Oh wait.
Please.
Hyungnim, hyungnim!
Why do you do this, hyungnim?
You took our money.
Did you think that if you ran away from Vietnam that we couldn't follow you?
It's a global age.
Our branches are embedded all over the world.
No matter where you go, you'll get caught.
What should we do?
This is the list of executives who will be in attendance at the anniversary celebration.
Once the reception is finished we're planning to go right into the dinner.
But... there's something I'm curious about.
Why did you change the day of the higher officer's memorial?
It's not originally this day.
This day...
That day was the day where Heaven was replaced with Hell.
Mother.
Dad!
I'm sorry.
Mr. Cha Jeong, don't!
Your life is a precious thing!
Mr. Cha Jeong.
Mr. Cha Jeong.
Don't!
Mr. Cha Jeong Woo!
Leave this path!
Mr. Cha Jeong, don't!
M-Mr.
Cha Jeong, don't.
Mr. Cha-
Oh, of all things.
How could a man not have a strong will?
Is this the tutor that Seung Hyeon requested?
Yeo Jin, how long has it been?
Look here.
How much money do you need?
An investment with conditions attached,
I won't accept it.
A guy that's almost dead...we see all kind of things, don't we?
I had no intention of dying.
It's because I was so completely surprised.
At that time I and the company were both reborn.
That's why I changed it to this day.
It's also the day we first met.
What is it all of a sudden?
What happened to your face?
Because you don't come home often
Oppa came to see you.
I don't have time so just get to the point.
Could it be...
Before you left for Vietnam, the one room deposit that you took and ran away with.
Did you come here to throw it up.
What is this?
Obviously, it's money.
Really?
Is it really money?
It's $500.
What is it?
Where did you get this?
What is it?
Say it quickly.
Brother-in-Law gave it to me.
What?
He said that it was the consolation compensation.
because he said that you left it.
For real.
I only went because he called me there.
Why won't you believe me?
And so, did you ask for money when you went there?
No!
If I had asked for anything, I would have been struck by lightening.
When I got there, he put an envelope out as if he had been waiting to.
He said that you wouldn't take it.
Think about it carefully.
You need money too.
To do that over your pride, what good is family for?
To help you out in times like this,
Who asked you to do that?
In any case, I'm just giving it to you.
And
And what?
What!
What!
What more is there?
That's, well, a handling fee.
A handling fee?
I took a slight amount from it.
After all, I did do some work in getting it.
Oppa, tell me clearly.
How much did you get?
Three thousand?
Three billion.
What?
Three billion?
Wait, so you got three billion and five hundred is left?
Don't say anything more and just give it here.
I'm going to return it to him.
-Quit messing around.
-I don't have it.
What do you mean you don't have it?
Where is it?
Give it to me now.
No matter how much you abuse me, I can't take that money.
I'll give it back to him, so hurry up and give it, where is it?
I don't have the money, honestly.
You don't have it?
Ae Ra, please let it go this once.
While I was in Vietnam running my business I had to borrow some money, but those guys wanted to kill me!
I'm telling you that I almost died!
I just couldn't live like that.
Ae Ra,
Since it's already happened, let's look on the bright side.
To someone like him, this three million?
It's not even money to him.
Can you really not shut your mouth?
Get lost!
Get lost, you!
Just get out of my life!
This is why I don't like the men in our family!
Dad constantly sucks Mom dry, and Oppa do your part to take what you can.
Do you know what kind of money that is?
That punk promised me that he'd never make me work in my life, which he lied about and feels sorry.
He lied and feels bad about it!
He gave it to me to get lost!
Do you get it?
But that,
I'd have to sign an agreement, he'd give it to me if I signed an agreement.
That's why I didn't take it, because he was so dirty and petty!
But you took that money!
That money!
Should I go up or do you want to come down?
There's a park in front of the office.
I'll see you there.
Okay.
DT Soft Ventures. 3 year Establishment Anniversary.
Friday February 14, 2014.
Golden Tree Hotel Garden Square.
I don't have time.
What is it you wanted to say.
I won't talk long.
You gave money to my brother.
So it was that after all.
I told you that I wouldn't accept it.
Why did you uselessly give my brother and make a person the fool?
If you raised your pride once that's enough.
I thought that you had sent him because you were embarrassed to accept it yourself.
Fine.
Whether I took it or my Oppa took it,
Anyway, okay, I accepted it.
I didn't want to take it and let your mind be comfortable, so I wasn't going to accept it, but I took it.
When I think about it, there's no reason not to take it.
I'll use it thankfully and well.
With this everything between us truly ends.
There won't be any reason to see you again so
You live your life, and I'll live my life.
Alright?
I came because I wanted to say this to you.
Eat well and Live well.
Hey Cha Jeong Woo!
Let me ask you one last thing.
The Company establishment Anniversary, is February 14th right?
If it's 3 years ago, that day is the day we divorced.
You really made this company on that day.
Oh, you didn't know, did you?
As soon as I divorced you, that very day a large investment came in.
What?
Isn't it so incredible?
As soon as you got out of my life, work just flowed amazingly.
Even then, you didn't contact me all this time?
Why should I have called you?
Don't you have any loyalty?
Loyalty?
I only listened to your request.
What?
Don't you remember?
Valentine's day.
The day we broke up.
"Don't use alimony as an excuse to call me."
"Just leave my life quietly."
Don't use alimony as an excuse to call me.
Just quietly,
Buzz off from my life.
I'll make that request this time.
Quietly get out of my life.
Na Ae Ra.
Even if you had come back because of the money, it probably wasn't love.
Cha Jeong Woo, you son of a b!
%@$.
I'm going to crush you.
I said that I'm going to crush you.
Episode 3 Preview
Who asked you for money?
I'm most thankful for then.
You should have at least told me.
It's the most precious thing I learned from working.
Do you express your admiration with phit, phut, pht?
What's so cool about him?
Where the responsibility lies this time, we will definitely assign blame before we continue.
No matter what, I can't give up on myself.
And what is all this?
Didn't you know that you'll leave a record if you go in?
Is it all over now?
You're going to work at my hospital?
Can't I?
Just cure her, doctor.
I'll take care of the rest.
Anger is the only emotion you allow yourself to feel.
You will not touch her!
The others make you sick.
Is that clear?
Very clear.
It happens to me.
- What?
- I have panic attacks, too.
I had an attack at the pool.
I'm sick of it.
Come on!
I'm going to be late.
Move, move.
Sir?
Sir?
I need an ambulance, please.
Mont-Royal Lane, Saint-Dominique.
Victor?
- Victor?
- What are you doing?
Waking him up.
You know you can't sleep here.
The ladies don't like it.
- Hey!
- He's not doing well.
He's in a bad shape.
I'm Dr. Clément,
St. Hippolyte.
Take him to the ER.
We usually take him to St. Louis.
It might just be an alcohol intoxication.
Let's not tempt fate.
Put him on oxygen and check his vital signs.
I'll meet you there.
What was your name, again?
Dr. Lady.
HELPING BEATRICE
You're at the hospital.
We'll take care of you.
- Why are you here?
- I'm...
It's a long story.
I'm leaving now.
I need a scan to rule out a head injury.
- And rehydrate him.
- OK.
I'm on it.
Don't try to fool me.
It won't work.
Why did you do it?
It's written here.
"Do not resuscitate".
Can't you read?
We signed a form six months ago to avoid this.
I'll sue you.
I'm going to sue this hospital.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't...
I'll take you to court!
Hello, I'm Dr. Clément, Dr. Laveaux's supervisor.
You are...
I'm sorry.
I had an accident.
I haven't had time to change.
You're unhappy with how your mother has been treated?
We had signed a Do-Not-Resuscitate form, and this young man disregarded it.
I wanted...
Even with a power of attorney, there are exceptions,
Mr. Trottier.
Your mother arrived in respiratory distress, but her other organs were functioning well.
This is the third time.
I love my mother, but I'm tired.
That's why we signed.
But when she's not feeling well, she calls an ambulance.
She's scared of dying alone.
Dr. Laveaux, I need to talk to you.
Hello.
This is Béatrice.
I'm sorry, I'm not going to make it.
Well, I guess I didn't make it.
I had an emergency.
Nothing to do with me, I'm OK.
Thank you, and sorry again.
Goodbye.
What were you thinking?
There was a Do-Not-Resuscitate form.
The nurses told you about it, but you did it anyway.
The patient was conscious.
Whatever.
There's a protocol.
If there's a DNR order, you have to check with a supervisor to override it.
I didn't...
I haven't finished.
You made a value judgement on the patient and her son.
I don't get it.
Are you against euthanasia, Dr. Laveaux?
- Euthanasia?
- Yes.
It depends on the circumstances.
Nobody cares.
Do you understand?
You can't say to Mr. Trottier:
"I can't let her die".
You're going to apologize.
If he takes this to court, you're going to screw things up for all of us.
You're a good doctor, Laveaux.
I hope you'll be a responsible one, too.
Now excuse me, I have to change.
You were the only one who could take care of that?
You could have come anyway, after sorting out the homeless man problem.
I already said I'm sorry.
What else do you want?
A note from my father?
Sometimes, a client's absences tell us more than their presences.
I'm not criticizing you.
Thank you.
You're the best.
But what did it have to be you who took care of the old lady?
Because I'm responsible for my new intern.
If the patient's son had sued us,
I'd have had my wrist slapped.
You?
Not the hospital?
Sure.
The hospital too.
But I would have got the short end of the stick.
Would you have been... punished?
What?
You told me you felt your father punished you because your brother was under your care when he died.
Yes.
I don't see the connection.
Your intern - who's under your care - makes a mistake and you're the one to blame.
Yes, but... it has nothing to do with my parents or anybody.
That's the way it is.
I'm his supervisor.
Even on your free day?
Excuse me for saying this, but you're tiring.
You seem affected on a personal level by your intern's mistake.
"On a personal level"...
No.
No.
Right.
Are we good?
I think the matter's closed for today.
Alright.
How did the rest of the week go?
Badly.
Béa.
- What's that?
- Compost.
What is that for?
Didn't you tell me you needed help with the compost?
Yes, but I meant cleaning it, aerating it.
I thought you wanted me to buy some, since you're short of money.
- It's expensive.
- We don't buy it.
We make it.
All our members participate.
We use residues, waste.
Oh, really?
Well, now you have more.
You can mix it up with the rest.
The guy said it's ready to use.
Thanks, but that's not compost.
- What is it?
- Sheep manure.
Really?
And?
The members voted for an entirely vegetal fertilizer.
"The members" this, "the members" that...
Is this a garden or a sect?
Leave it over there.
I'll give it to someone.
OK.
Anything else I can do for you?
Help me turn the soil over.
You're giving it away?
To whom?
You're really asking me that?
Well, yes.
I'm no expert.
Turning the soil over means digging, breaking it up.
OK.
Give me that.
I'm sorry, but weren't you supposed to help Benoît today?
Yes, but not today, tomorrow.
- Wasn't he moving out?
- Tomorrow's the 10th.
No.
Today's the 10th.
- No.
- Yes.
Oh, shit!
Shit...
What time is it?
What's the matter?
I'm sorry, I have to go.
I'll be back.
- What do you...
Don't walk on that!
- I'll be back, I promise.
It's OK.
It's more than dirty.
It's disgusting.
Sure, you're looking for trouble just for the fun of it.
Yeah, right!
Oh, Ben.
I'm so sorry.
I suck.
I totally forgot.
I had a bad day.
It's OK, Béa.
It could be worse, believe me.
I'm not moving in there.
What?
It's... indescribable.
I believe things got nasty between the tenants and the owner.
Listen...
No.
I'll help.
We'll clean it up.
No, Béa.
You won't do that.
Believe me, it's not a good idea.
OK, but...
What are you going to do?
I don't know...
I'm...
The mover has left.
I'm stuck here.
OK.
Back to my place.
We'll pack the cars.
We'll make two trips.
Another mover will take the rest of the furniture.
No.
I have a friend with a van.
I'll try to...
No.
That's out of the question.
We'll call a moving company.
That's final.
OK, madam.
You still have that ugly old thing?
It was already awful back in 1984.
- I like it.
- Is it really necessary?
Do you feel responsible for your aunt and your ex-husband?
Excuse me?
Why are you asking me that?
Judging by what you told me, you feel almost obliged to help them.
No.
No...
I take care of my close relations.
That's me.
Taking care of and being responsible for aren't the same.
- Please.
What's so wrong about it?
I wouldn't worry too much about simple things.
Well, good for you.
When I say I'm going to do something, I do it.
I was raised like that.
Really?
Can you tell me more about it?
I looked after my brother a lot, and... when he died, I took care of my mother.
Was she ill?
What do you think?
She had lost her 9-year-old son.
My father worked till late and I had to go back home right after school so my mother wouldn't be alone.
If he found out I had taken too long, well... he would come down on me.
Really?
Alright, I understand.
What do you understand?
You've been angry at me since the beginning.
Do you feel I'm coming down on you because you missed our appointment?
Oh, boy...
That's a little far-fetched.
Maybe, but since you got here today, I've been wondering why you're so...
- Annoying?
- No.
No, no.
Suspicious, as if you were waiting for something unpleasant to happen.
No.
Lately, I expect anything.
I told you, I screwed up with everyone.
You don't allow yourself to have flaws.
You must be perfect, as we said last time.
Don't talk to me about last time.
Time's up, anyway.
I have to go.
Alright.
But before you leave, just out of curiosity, why did your father work till late?
My father was an OB/GYN.
For 30 years, he was head of the obstetrics unit at the hospital where I work.
He's retired now, but he still sees patients at his private office.
What do you think about that?
It's a very time-consuming job, indeed.
No.
That's not what I meant.
I'm sorry.
What did you mean?
What do you think about the fact
I do the same job as my father?
That must be a classic.
It does seem to mean a lot to you anyhow.
We could talk about it next week, if you want to.
- Is she asleep?
- Yes.
You stayed all this time with her?
Yes.
Why?
You know why.
You're spoiling her.
She won't go to sleep when I'm with her.
Find the way.
Christophe, she must learn to fall asleep by herself.
It's the only way.
There are children for whom it is harder.
But she's 9.
She's not a baby anymore.
She misses Béatrice.
She wonders why her big sister doesn't come to see her.
I know.
She's mentioned it several times.
We could invite Béatrice to lunch.
Yes.
Why not.
Don't get too excited.
- You want me to jump for joy?
- Don't start.
I'm not starting anything.
It's not always easy with Béatrice.
If you want to know,
I'm tired of being stuck between you and her.
If you want to invite her to lunch, just do it.
Dad?
Wait.
I'll go.
Alright?
Milos!
Dr. Clément.
You don't look very happy.
I got this today.
I passed the first part of the Institute of Physicians test.
Part two is not necessary since I have a 25-year experience in Poland and Haiti.
And?
The Medical Association won't let me take their exam if I don't pass that second part.
Then take the test, if it's that big a deal to them.
It takes place once a year.
And it was held a month ago.
No, Béa.
Don't do anything.
Give me that letter.
I don't want to make any mistakes.
Did you tell them I was your student when you were head of ER?
I told them everything.
I don't know what happened.
I worked at Trois-Rivières for 15 years.
I helped young people from deprived neighborhoods.
After a sabbatical year, I decided to go back to work, and so I got here.
So, there.
I'm also an amateur ornithologist.
It's my passion along with social work, of course.
And I'm very happy to be with you now.
That's it.
Thank you.
Welcome.
Oh, no, please.
Everybody, back to work.
That was a nice presentation.
Thank you.
Looks like you know Dr. Béatrice Clément.
- We were married.
- Really?
I didn't know.
I didn't put in on my résumé.
I thought it was irrelevant.
I haven't read your résumé.
Unfortunately, you were hired while I was on vacation.
I have a case for you.
A homeless man hospitalized since yesterday.
Hello.
I wanted to know about the requirements for the Medical Association exam.
No.
It's for a foreign doctor.
No, I don't need to go to your website.
I want to know why you told a foreign doctor with 25 years of experience he didn't have to take the test and then said the opposite thing.
OK...
Alright.
Dr. Lisowski.
Miloslaw Lisowski.
Me?
Dr. Béatrice Clément, from St. Hippolyte hospital.
Sir...
Hello, sir.
My name is Benoît.
You'll be out of here soon.
You have nothing serious.
I've brought you some information about shelters, safe places where you can spend the night.
Are you feeling OK?
Do you understand?
Do you speak Spanish?
Benoît is still here?
He's looking, but he has very little time.
Today was his first day at the hospital.
It's odd, don't you think?
What?
Benoît living here with you, finding a job at the same hospital where you work.
- Are you two together again?
- Honestly...
This is the last time
I give you a plant.
- Why?
Look at it.
It's been dead for a while.
Really?
I've watered it, though.
- When was that?
- I don't know.
A few months ago.
It's funny you don't care about plants.
Edith loved them.
She used to bring me to the mountains...
Stop it, auntie.
I get it.
My mother was Miss Nature, and I'm Miss Failure.
Why are you so upset?
Because the Edith you know, the Edith everybody knew, the brilliant, beautiful woman who was married to a great doctor is not the woman I knew.
You're so bitter.
I know.
You took care of her until she died.
Dad and I are indebted to you, but I can't stand being compared to her.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
It's sad you kept such a bad image of her.
I already have a shrink, Ginette.
I don't need another one.
Don't call me Ginette.
OK, auntie.
Don't call me auntie.
- OK, dude.
- Hey!
Hello.
Yes...
I have something for you.
To help you.
Here are... the places you can go to.
Community centers.
They will help you...
Thank you.
Spasiba.
Yes, spasiba.
- Hello!
- Hi.
I smell cigarette smoke.
Béatrice Clément, you smoke in secret.
Of course not.
First of all, this is my place.
Second, save your breath.
I could give you a thousand arguments against smoking.
So?
How was your first day?
Not bad.
I took care of a homeless man.
Victor?
- You know him?
- Yes.
I took him to the ER.
Speaking of homeless, did you find an apartment?
No.
Not yet.
It's hell.
OK.
Listen, forget about that.
Take my guest room, and pay me 500 dollars a month.
End of discussion.
Are you serious?
Ben, I'm not asking you to marry me, just to live with me.
We get along, we will barely see each other since we work all day.
Take it or leave it.
Is the cigarette negotiable?
Deal.
Are you OK, Zach?
She asked you to come and get me?
I'm just taking out the trash.
OK.
I'm the freak who moves the garbage bins.
Don't tell her you saw me here.
Don't tell who?
My mother.
She's looking for me.
She wants me to see a shrink.
But I don't want to take pills.
I'll sort it out.
I don't know your mother.
I don't know anyone.
You can trust me.
Why would I do that?
Because you've helped me.
Twice.
I would never hurt a person who helped me.
OK.
I forgot what I was doing.
You interrupted me, madam.
Do you want me... to put all this away?
Listen, I have an idea.
It's very simple.
We'll put the waste on one side and the bins on the other side.
If we do so, we'll be able to read the numbers.
There's no rush.
We can take our time.
Obsessive compulsive disorder is not easy at all.
It can lead to serious pathologies.
You must know about that.
Can you tell me about it?
You take your friend's mental health very seriously.
You should've seen him...
It was heartbreaking.
Poor kid...
Someone has to do something.
You mean you have to do something.
Nobody seems to take care of him.
Didn't you say he was on medication?
Yes.
But he looks like he's on his own.
- His mother doesn't seem fit.
- Really?
Did you meet her?
No, but judging by what Zacharie told me...
I don't know.
She might have a problem with alcohol.
Your friend, Zacharie, is he like a son for you?
No, he's more like a brother.
Are you scared Zacharie might die?
Like your brother.
Well...
Yes.
You're right.
I shouldn't get involved.
I ruin everything.
Hi.
Hi.
Do you want to have lunch with us one day, soon?
Océane hasn't seen you since her birthday.
Yeah, I'm kind of busy.
She asks about you.
We don't know what to tell her.
Why don't you tell her the truth?
What truth?
That her Dad and her big sister don't get along well.
Christophe can be harsh, but he loves you.
You used to come more often.
- Before what?
- I don't know.
I have nothing against you.
I've told Christophe that I find it hard to be stuck between you two.
I know it's complicated, but at least don't use me as a plug.
Regarding lunch,
I'll check my schedule and see what I can do.
Thank you.
Say hello to Océane.
I asked for information on the experience years.
They said nothing.
I gave them your name.
Did you know your father's a member of the Association's Recognition Committee?
No.
Are you sure?
That's why I didn't want you to get involved.
Now they believe I put pressure on a member of the committee.
Oh, come on...
But how could they think...
Christophe?
He would have done that?
This is Christophe Clément.
Leave a message.
Listen, Christophe.
You send me Isabelle to tell me you and Océane want to see me, while you pick on my friend?
You're jealous because he has taught me more than my own father.
Don't go wondering why I don't visit you!
Even on the phone, leaving him a message on his voicemail...
I'm scared of my father.
What are you scared of exactly?
Was your father violent when you were a child?
"Violent", no.
But if I happened to object to one of his decisions...
Once a week, I had to make him a report on how mom had been doing.
If I hadn't been efficient enough in preventing her... from being sad or depressed,
I would get a rocket.
He'd floor me with his speech.
It was hell.
You think it's funny?
I'm sorry.
Doesn't it ring a bell?
Weekly meetings, giving explanations, talking about your job, being efficient?
That is weird.
Now I understand why you often seem hurt or annoyed during our sessions.
Do you think I evaluate you?
Yes.
Maybe.
It's crazy because each time I come here,
I feel anxious before.
I'm anxious.
Sometimes, I don't feel like coming.
I force myself.
Sometimes you're so nervous you don't come.
No, that was because I...
Yeah.
Maybe.
But there's a big difference between your sessions and the meetings with my father.
I come because I want to.
I'm glad to hear that.
- Mr. Trottier?
- Yes.
Dr. Clément.
- Your mother's here?
- Yes.
She's probably in the resuscitation room, to the left.
Mom!
Mom!
I'm here.
- Pressure?
- 90 over 50.
Pulse is 95.
We can give her something for her pressure, or you don't want to?
No.
But I don't want her to suffer.
Palliative treatment, then.
OK.
Pressure?
90 over 50.
That's low, but I can stabilize her.
However, it's a quite advanced treatment.
Dr. Clément, please.
- I'll take care of this case.
- No.
We can't afford any mistakes.
We're on thin ice.
I made a mistake last time.
Do you want me to pay for it?
- That's not the issue.
- What is it, then?
OK, alright.
Page me if there's a problem.
Mr. Trottier.
I'll leave you with Dr. Laveaux.
I trust him.
Good luck.
I didn't mean to.
When I heard you called me, I thought you had a problem with your friend Miloslaw.
Yes.
Dr. Lisowski had a problem.
But that's none of your business.
I thought you could be accused of ethical misconduct, that he was pressurizing you.
Those people are up for anything to access our medicine.
"Those people"!
What are you talking about?
Foreign doctors.
Can we blame them?
Can you blame me for worrying about your reputation?
Can you blame me for trying to spare you a seeming conflict of interest?
That's not the case.
I notified the Medical Association of a lack of rigor.
Dr. Lisowski didn't know and he's in deeper trouble now.
I'll talk to the Committee.
I'll ask the members to reconsider Miloslaw's dossier...
Dr. Lisowski's dossier.
Alright?
That's... the least you can do.
As for the rest of your message, regarding what I supposedly didn't do for you...
I'll put it down to your being worried.
OK?
Right.
Last time, you said about your father's job:
"That must be a classic".
What's "classic"?
It seems obvious to me.
The obedient, well-behaved girl who listens to her dad and ends up doing the same job as him.
I didn't see it that way.
Does he have something to do with your career?
"Something to do"?
You should ask if there's anything in my life that doesn't have to do with my father.
We'll probably go back to that.
Before you go, I would like to tell you that I'm really happy.
Happy?
I feel I understand you better now.
What do you understand, exactly?
That you feel comfortable helping others, even if they don't ask for it.
I think it's normal to take care of the people you love.
In your case, there might be a lot at stake.
What do you mean?
You think the world's going to stop if you don't take care of it yourself.
That's not true.
Is that your bike, Dr. Laveaux?
Yes.
I always bike to work, even when I come at night.
I'm well equipped.
The lights are useful if you don't forget to turn them off.
It does happen.
What about Mrs. Trottier?
She died at 4:50 PM.
It's my first death.
It's not easy.
It's not.
- But you did the right thing.
- Thank you.
Have a nice evening.
Oh, no...
I can't believe this.
Shit!
- Is there a problem?
- Yes, I...
I forgot to turn off the lights and now my battery's dead.
As you were saying, lights are useful when you turn them off.
Making fun of me?
Not at all.
Well, you should.
I deserve it.
There's a taxi stand nearby.
They can get you started.
OK.
Thank you.
Unless...
Maybe I can drop you off?
On your bike?
Yes, it's not that far.
Umm...
No.
I don't think so.
Thank you.
I'll wait here.
OK.
Alright.
See you later.
Dr. Laveaux.
Can I walk next to your bike?
I mean, next to you.
With pleasure.
Thank you.
I became a doctor, like you wanted.
And I'm a pretty good one.
Can you stop?
You got married at 17.
He's to blame for your falling behind in your career.
OK!
Can we stop with the arguing?
Subtitles:
Eclair Media
"Last Man Standing" is recorded in front of a live studio audience.
It's bad enough we lost the game.
I didn't even get to play.
Well, look at the upside.
I don't have to wash your uniform.
Your dad is happy 'cause you spent the night with football players and didn't see any action.
It's coach Foster's fault we keep losing.
I mean, he always calls the same five plays.
Yeah, is one of those plays get sacked and lose six yards?
That's the only play you guys seem to have.
I don't think we should criticize Eve's coach in front of her.
He's no Vince Lombardi.
He's not even Vince, that weird kid that bags our groceries.
He's not a kid.
He's 40.
And what bagger Vince lacks in skills, he makes up for in hugs.
I just thought being the kicker on the football team would be a little more fun.
I mean, losing sucks.
Honey, you got to take the bad with the good.
I mean, isn't that one of those life lessons that sports is supposed to teach you?
No.
Losing coach says that so the kids won't cry on the bus.
Kyle just called and said that he crashed his motorcycle.
- What?
- Oh, my God, my poor boyfriend.
Is it serious?
Well, we've been together for two years, but now is no time to talk about that.
He's hurt.
Ed:
Oh, there you are, son.
- Glad you're okay.
- Yeah.
Good thing he hit his head...
Something he doesn't use here at work.
Yeah, the, uh, doctor said I got a pretty nasty bump on the back of my head.
Back of your head?
What's this, then?
The front of my head.
You can tell 'cause it's got a face on it.
Why the bandage?
Oh, this happened after the accident.
I, uh, burnt my forehead on the muffler.
Did you know you're supposed to wait for your bike to cool down before you work on it?
Yes.
So, you were not wearing a helmet.
As Mr. B says, "helmets are for ladies who don't want to muss their hair."
Or if you're being shot out of a cannon.
And if you don't wear a helmet doing that, you're just showing off.
Why don't you just go home, take a little rest day, hmm?
No, no, the doctor said I need to stay awake for 24 hours, which shouldn't be hard because I slept like a baby after the crash...
A baby flashing in and out of consciousness and occasionally vomiting.
(Sighs)
There should be a law forcing a kid that careless to wear a helmet.
And not just on a motorcycle... all day long.
We value our freedoms here in Colorado.
You don't have to put a helmet on.
You can ride your motorcycle right to the pot store, and then come here and buy yourself a rifle.
It's amazing anyone's still alive here in Colorado.
Stupid accidents like Kyle's, though, can raise our health-insurance costs.
I'm already paying more to meet the new Obamacare requirements.
And I thought if you liked your present healthcare plan, you could keep it.
Now they're making us add stuff like vision care and birth control.
If women get vision care, our men won't need birth control.
Sounds like you're more interested in the bottom line than Kyle's head.
Kyle's head is a lost cause.
We should consider cutting our employees to part time...
No.
So we don't have to pay for their healthcare.
We take care of our employees at Outdoor Man.
We always have, and we always will.
If I cut them loose, they can get their own plan on the private exchange.
I don't think so.
Anybody who can figure out that exchange is too smart to be working here.
Ohh.
Oh, hey, don't be stingy, mom.
I've got to carbo-load for tomorrow night's game.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, none for me.
- I'm gonna peach-pie-load later.
- Vanessa:
Oh.
So, Ed is seriously considering canceling the employee healthcare plan?
As serious as a heart attack.
If anybody at work wants a heart attack, they better do it now.
And you know what?
I blame this on your president.
You said that last month when it hailed.
I cannot believe you are still railing against Obamacare.
Wasn't that, like, 10 fake scandals ago?
Well, we all agree he screws up a lot, but I prefer his earlier, classic screw-ups.
I think it's a nice impulse to give more Americans insurance.
But that's not his job.
Who does he think he is, that cooler black dude on the allstate commercials?
Well, I'm grateful to the president that Kyle was covered for his accident.
Well, the feds had nothing to do with it, you know.
We took care of Kyle at Outdoor Man.
We take care of our employees because we choose to.
It's like when I choose to empty the dishwasher.
It's great because I choose it.
It's the right thing to do.
It's better than when your mom nags me to do it.
When have you ever emptied the dishwasher?
I'm just making a point.
Okay.
- Oh, hey, Kyle.
- Hi.
Hey, sorry to disturb your dinner.
You hungry, Kyle?
Oh, no, it's okay.
I ate at Denny's.
Not the restaurant, my neighbor.
I ate with him and his wife, ihop.
She's from Pakistan.
Hey, I, uh, have my bike in the van.
You said to bring it by.
Yeah, we can fix it, and then after we're done, I'll run alongside you to make sure you know how to ride it.
Good one, Mr. B.
You roll it in and I'll change my clothes.
Um, hey, dad.
So, Kyle still plans on riding his motorcycle?
It's like that old slogan... you fall off a horse, you want to get right back on it.
That's what I told him.
And there's a 50-50 chance he'll actually bring a horse into the garage.
Hey.
Wow.
It got this messed up in your accident?
It also fell out of my van rounding the corner on Birch Street.
I need to get a back door for my van.
Also a new patio table for that restaurant on Birch Street.
Kyle, you were really lucky to walk away from this accident with a concussion.
I know.
My dreams have been awesome.
No, I mean with nothing worse than a concussion.
You could have had a spinal injury and ended up a paralegal.
Mandy, I know you worry.
And that's why I'll be wearing a helmet from now on.
But please don't tell your dad 'cause I don't want him to think of me as a lady who cares about mussed hair.
No, sweetie, I don't want you riding it at all.
I don't want to lose you in some stupid accident...
Or even a smart one, like whatever happened to Stephen Hawking.
Really?
Not ride anymore?
Please.
Okay.
If it means that much to you, I'll sell the bike.
Thank you.
Maybe it's time I get that horse your dad keeps talking about.
Come on, how many dads can say their teenage daughter threw the winning touchdown pass in a football game?
Just you... over and over and over.
Everybody in the parking lot to the homeless guy at the intersection.
Geez, you should have at least given the guy a dollar.
I gave him something better ...an inspirational story.
Come on.
If a teenage girl can throw a touchdown pass on an all-boys football team, the sky's the limit for a 40-year-old alcoholic with a dog on a rope.
Eve was just supposed to kick the ball, not mix it up with those burly boys.
This is a perfect fake field goal.
She rolls out, hits the guy in the end zone, and touchdown!
Man:
Touchdown, Woodbridge High!
Yes!
I was scared to death.
But my girl sure throws a sweet spiral.
That was a perfectly designed play.
I take back everything I said about that stupid coach.
Well, maybe he finally heard you.
I don't think so.
He still wears that ugly visor.
Yeah, we get it.
You've been to Seaworld.
Please, can you try to contain your enthusiasm in front of Mandy and Kristin.
They already feel like you favor Eve.
It would be weird if they didn't.
I make it pretty obvious.
Ah!
Hey, hey!
Touchdown!
Yeah!
There's my football hero!
Your mom has been bragging about you since the game.
We're a little worried about your sisters, though...
Silver and Bronze.
Honey, shouldn't you be out celebrating with the team?
I don't really feel like celebrating.
Why not?
(Sighs) The coach benched me.
- After winning the game?
!
- Honey...
I take back everything I took back about that guy.
Why did the coach bench you?
You executed his play perfectly.
Yeah, but it wasn't his play.
He wanted me to kick the field goal and tie the game, but I had a better idea... winning.
So, you disobeyed his order.
Honey, imagine if everyone did that on the team.
Yeah, we'd be undefeated.
I mean, dad gets it.
Happy, Mike?
Huh?
I mean, she only did this because of the way you constantly undermine her coach in front of her.
So, in a way...
I won this game.
Kyle, we're out of sugar and cream.
Oh, yeah.
Mr. Alzate said they're unhealthy, so it all went in the dumpster, along with the chips and the doughnuts.
The guys aren't too happy.
I bet the raccoons are excited, huh?
Yeah, Mr. Alzate wants us to watch what we eat, but as usual, raccoons get to do whatever they want.
Where's Ed?
Uh, he's in the break room doing yoga.
Ed in yoga pants...
That'll stop people from eating.
And now let's all fold forward.
Ohh, one vertebrae at a time.
Namaste, Mikey.
Nama-stay away from me.
You smell like armpits and incense.
That's the smell of saving money.
I figured out a way to cut back on our health-insurance costs.
We get a big break by encouraging healthy habits and exercise.
You know, the customers down on the floor are getting a lot of exercise walking around looking for salespeople.
Come on.
It's... it's just 40 minutes a day.
I'm gonna whip these fatties into shape.
Yeah, and what we save in healthcare, we're paying in lawsuits for calling people "fatties."
So, uh, is your girlfriend working here now?
She's a first-rate yoga instructor.
If she gets me any more limber, I won't even need a girlfriend.
Hey, Mike, there's a yoga mat right here with your name on it.
Who wants to see Mike in the yoga class?
(Chuckling) Hey!
Who wants to get fired?
And fold forward.
I'm telling you, Mike, our guys are loving yoga.
A little grumbling at first.
It's probably their stomachs.
As soon as you left the room, they headed down to the dumpster to fight those raccoons for the doughnuts.
I hear running and fighting are two very good forms of exercise.
Listen, at Outdoor Man, we love our employees.
We want them healthy.
But what you're saying is they're not good enough the way they are.
They aren't.
But...
You're saying it.
I'm tired of being on the hook for their risky lifestyles.
What risky lifestyles?
Half of them are out of shape, and the fit ones are doing very dangerous stuff like snowmobiles...
We sell these.
...jet skis, and... and...
and rock-climbing.
We can't dictate what our employees do in their free time.
We can, if they want to stay our employees.
If they stub a toe, our insurance rates go up.
Uh (Whistles) you, come in.
Uh, that's enough.
Come on down here.
Come on.
Come on.
Leave the dangerous activities to our customers.
Let them kill themselves.
It doesn't cost us anything.
Except return customers.
If we want healthy employees, let's make happy employees.
Let them do stuff that they want to do in their own free time.
If they want to rock-climb, parasail, or eat fried carnival foods, I don't care.
H-hey, Mr. B.
I need to talk to you about my motorcycle.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
This is a perfect example of that.
This kid does a swan dive off his motorcycle, hits the street.
Does he stop riding motorcycles because it's risky behavior?
Actually, that's what I really want...
No, he does not because it makes him happy.
We're gonna get better brakes on it, new tires, get a better safety suit, and you get back out there.
Yeah.
It would be nice to hit the road again.
Right, and, you know, just don't lead with your head this time.
(Door opens) Hey.
Oh, wow, how was practice?
Brutal.
While the rest of the team was watching game film, coach punished me by making me run the bleachers 50 times...
In full pads.
Aah, more stairs.
Maybe it'll be better tomorrow.
Oh, it's definitely gonna be better tomorrow because I'm quitting the team, and don't try to talk me out of it.
You know what?
I never wanted you to play football in the first place.
But I hate to see you quit something just because it's not going your way.
Well, you're about to be 0-for-2.
Ow.
(Doorbell rings)
Ow.
Ah, screw it.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
- Hey, Kyle.
Hi.
- Hey, Mrs. B.
- How's your head feeling?
- Great.
Mandy got me this burn ointment that really worked wonders.
It also turned out to be pretty effective at curing what doctors called
"an appalling case of athlete's foot."
Good news.
Now, on the downside, my feet don't get to be in a textbook.
Oh, Kyle.
Your head looks so much better.
You should see my feet.
I made some lemonade.
You guys want some?
Uh, did you use organic lemons?
Concentrate.
You're right.
I should know this.
All right.
You did.
I'll get the drinks.
So, hey, um, did you find anybody to buy your motorcycle yet?
Uh, well, your dad and I are still fixing it up.
How much are you gonna ask for it?
Actually, nothing.
Okay, I don't want to tell you how to negotiate, but, um, you might want to start, like, a little bit higher.
Uh, Mandy, I'm not selling the bike.
But we both agreed that you wouldn't ride anymore.
I know, but then I realized I'd be less of a man if I didn't ride my bike and eat deep-fried carnival food.
Real men are a dying breed.
That might be because of the motorcycles and the carnival food.
Sounds like you've been talking to my dad.
Really?
I sound that smart?
No.
You're not making any sense.
That part's probably me.
Look, Mandy, I don't want to stop riding my motorcycle.
I don't think it's fair for you to ask me to.
Oh, sorry.
I didn't realize my wanting to keep you alive was so unfair.
That's okay.
I forgive you.
I'm really glad we worked this out.
I was worried you were gonna be mad.
I can't believe Kyle is being so stubborn about this.
Mandy is worried sick because he insists on riding that motorcycle.
She's worried about that?
You know, he won't drive on 470 East 'cause he's afraid he has to pay a troll.
Well, you know what?
Maybe this is a big step for Mandy.
Worrying is the price you pay when you really care about someone.
Which is why I'm so calm all the time.
Why is she trying to clip the dude's wings, you know?
Maybe you should talk to her.
You don't worry when I ride my motorcycle.
Well, honey, Kyle does not have your good judgment.
Remember his indoor barbecue party?
(Chuckles) Kyle doesn't.
And, yes, I do.
You do what?
Worry.
Worry.
I worry every time you roar down the driveway on that stupid motorcycle.
And until I hear you come back, I have a pit in my stomach.
Well, you eat a lot of fruit.
Maybe it is a pit.
Come on, Vanessa.
We talked about this.
You said you're okay with me riding the motorcycle.
I know.
I know, honey.
I try to be, but (Sighs)
Worrying is the price I pay for caring about someone.
You know, you... you do dangerous stuff I don't always mention.
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Walking around here looking like you do.
Mm?
Why don't we go upstairs?
Now?
Ah...
Why didn't you say something before we ate half a cake?
I mean...
Blah!
All right, I get your point, yeah.
But let the record show...
I wanted to.
Man:
Touchdown, Woodbridge High!
What are you watching the game film for?
Your mom says you're gonna quit.
Well, I like the part where I win.
Or the part where 78 gets his junk stepped on.
Right there.
Ow.
You know, that fake field goal is a gutsy call.
A lot could go wrong on a call like that, huh?
Fumble that snap, overthrow the receiver, get sacked.
The point is I didn't, so...
The point is if you did, the team would have suffered the consequences.
But I didn't.
You told the receiver to post pattern into the end zone.
What if he decided, "wait a minute.
I'm gonna do what I want to do"?
Well, I told him what to do.
Yeah, and you were counting on him to listen, right?
Like the coach was counting on you to listen when he told you to kick the field goal.
Are you comparing me to coach Foster?
I'd have to see you in a Seaworld visor.
Kid, if you join the military, you can't make decisions on your own like this.
War is life-and-death.
This is just football.
Tell that to 78.
Kid's fighting for his life right there.
(Groans)
You don't want me to quit, do you?
I want you to stop coaching the team.
Let the coach do that, even if you think he's doing a bad job.
(Sighs)
All right.
Fine.
I'll stick it out.
That's my boy.
Still a girl, dad.
Just let me have this.
(Clears throat)
What's with the doughnuts?
You're gonna get in trouble.
Mr. Alzate gave up on all the health food.
Now the raccoons are stuck with all those carrot sticks and celery.
You should be the bigger man.
Run down there with a little ranch dressing.
Ed:
All right.
And I'll see you later at home, my baby.
Okay. (Chuckles, smooches)
Okay.
Hey, care for a doughnut, ma'am?
Oh, no, thanks.
I get enough sugar from this one right here.
Is that how he got you into the van in the first place?
That's my lady.
Look at her go.
We all like to see that.
So, Mr. Alzate, does this mean no more yoga classes?
Yeah, that's it.
I'm gonna stop telling people how to live their lives.
Mike was right... you can't stop our employees from engaging in risky behavior.
As a matter of fact, I've been engaging in a little bit myself.
Wendi is pregnant.
Congratulations, sir.
Who's the father?
I am, you idiot.
I guess those craftmatic adjustable beds do more of the work than I thought.
It is not uncommon for a fit man in his prime to continue siring children.
Picasso had a son at 70.
Did you see the picture of that kid?
He's got two ears on the same side of his head.
Well, I'm really happy for you, Mr. Alzate.
This is a wonderful thing, Mike.
Come on.
This is my last chance to have a son.
It's your last chance to do a lot of things.
You'll be going out when the kid's coming in.
Maybe you can wave at him in that weird tunnel they talk about.
"Hey."
You're not gonna ruin this for me, Mike.
You can make all the jokes you want.
Okay, how about Wendi?
She'll be, you know, cleaning diapers and wiping up drool and taking care of the baby.
What were you thinking?
I wasn't.
All right, I'm not about to start now.
Just a second.
Just a second here.
Here you are right here.
Something to soak up the alcohol.
Hold my calls.
(Door closes) Well, I guess we can go back to being risk-takers.
I was worried Mr. Alzate was gonna tell me
I couldn't ride my motorcycle anymore.
Only one person can make that decision for you.
- Me.
- No, me.
And I don't think you should ride that motorcycle anymore.
Is this because of Obamacare?
You know, I'd like to blame Obama because literally everything's his fault.
This isn't about that.
It's about somebody in your life who cares about you.
You know, somebody who's worried sick, frightened that you might get hurt.
You know what I'm talking about?
I get it.
Message received.
- Okay.
- I love you, too, Mr. B.
Ed:
Oh, my God, what the hell have I done?
!
Now he's thinking about it.
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man with a word on the affordable care act.
Yowch!
If nothing else, it should motivate us to never get sick.
You know, people have a lot of crazy ideas how to stay healthy.
And no matter what they do or how miserable it makes them, they always say the same thing, right?
"Oh, yeah, I-I-I've never felt better."
For instance, lemon water, maple syrup, and a dash of cayenne pepper.
This is called "the master cleanse."
South of the border, it's just called "tap water."
I call it "don't stand between me and a bathroom."
You drink nothing but this for 10 straight days...
What do the survivors say when they're finished?
"I've never felt better."
My question is, how bad were you feeling before?
Do you remember Jim Fixx?
Pretty much invented jogging, Jim.
Mm-hmm.
You know what else he invented?
Dropping dead while jogging.
You know what his last words were as he was lying on the pavement, clutching his chest?
"I'm pretty sure I've felt better."
Anything good or bad taken to extreme is bad.
Nike's motto is "Just do it."
Not just "do it until you're lying on the sidewalk and someone standing over you going "hey, aren't you Jim Fixx?"
"Last Man Standing" is recorded in front of a live studio audience.
It's bad enough we lost the game.
I didn't even get to play.
Well, look at the upside.
I don't have to wash your uniform.
Your dad is happy 'cause you spent the night with football players and didn't see any action.
It's coach Foster's fault we keep losing.
I mean, he always calls the same five plays.
Yeah, is one of those plays get sacked and lose six yards?
That's the only play you guys seem to have.
I don't think we should criticize Eve's coach in front of her.
He's no Vince Lombardi.
He's not even Vince, that weird kid that bags our groceries.
He's not a kid.
He's 40.
And what bagger Vince lacks in skills, he makes up for in hugs.
I just thought being the kicker on the football team would be a little more fun.
I mean, losing sucks.
Honey, you got to take the bad with the good.
I mean, isn't that one of those life lessons that sports is supposed to teach you?
No.
Losing coach says that so the kids won't cry on the bus.
Kyle just called and said that he crashed his motorcycle.
- What?
- Oh, my God, my poor boyfriend.
Is it serious?
Well, we've been together for two years, but now is no time to talk about that.
He's hurt.
Oh, there you are, son.
- Glad you're okay.
- Yeah.
Good thing he hit his head...
Something he doesn't use here at work.
Yeah, the, uh, doctor said I got a pretty nasty bump on the back of my head.
Back of your head?
What's this, then?
The front of my head.
You can tell 'cause it's got a face on it.
Why the bandage?
Oh, this happened after the accident.
I, uh, burnt my forehead on the muffler.
Did you know you're supposed to wait for your bike to cool down before you work on it?
Yes.
So, you were not wearing a helmet.
As Mr. B says, "helmets are for ladies who don't want to muss their hair."
Or if you're being shot out of a cannon.
And if you don't wear a helmet doing that, you're just showing off.
Why don't you just go home, take a little rest day, hmm?
No, no, the doctor said I need to stay awake for 24 hours, which shouldn't be hard because I slept like a baby after the crash...
A baby flashing in and out of consciousness and occasionally vomiting.
There should be a law forcing a kid that careless to wear a helmet.
And not just on a motorcycle... all day long.
We value our freedoms here in Colorado.
You don't have to put a helmet on.
You can ride your motorcycle right to the pot store, and then come here and buy yourself a rifle.
It's amazing anyone's still alive here in Colorado.
Stupid accidents like Kyle's, though, can raise our health-insurance costs.
I'm already paying more to meet the new Obamacare requirements.
And I thought if you liked your present healthcare plan, you could keep it.
Now they're making us add stuff like vision care and birth control.
If women get vision care, our men won't need birth control.
Sounds like you're more interested in the bottom line than Kyle's head.
Kyle's head is a lost cause.
We should consider cutting our employees to part time...
No.
So we don't have to pay for their healthcare.
We take care of our employees at Outdoor Man.
We always have, and we always will.
If I cut them loose, they can get their own plan on the private exchange.
I don't think so.
Anybody who can figure out that exchange is too smart to be working here.
Ohh.
Oh, hey, don't be stingy, mom.
I've got to carbo-load for tomorrow night's game.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, none for me.
- I'm gonna peach-pie-load later.
- Oh.
So, Ed is seriously considering canceling the employee healthcare plan?
As serious as a heart attack.
If anybody at work wants a heart attack, they better do it now.
And you know what?
I blame this on your president.
You said that last month when it hailed.
I cannot believe you are still railing against Obamacare.
Wasn't that, like, 10 fake scandals ago?
Well, we all agree he screws up a lot, but I prefer his earlier, classic screw-ups.
I think it's a nice impulse to give more Americans insurance.
But that's not his job.
Who does he think he is, that cooler black dude on the allstate commercials?
Well, I'm grateful to the president that Kyle was covered for his accident.
Well, the feds had nothing to do with it, you know.
We took care of Kyle at Outdoor Man.
We take care of our employees because we choose to.
It's like when I choose to empty the dishwasher.
It's great because I choose it.
It's the right thing to do.
It's better than when your mom nags me to do it.
When have you ever emptied the dishwasher?
I'm just making a point.
Okay.
- Oh, hey, Kyle.
- Hi.
Hey, sorry to disturb your dinner.
You hungry, Kyle?
Oh, no, it's okay.
I ate at Denny's.
Not the restaurant, my neighbor.
I ate with him and his wife, ihop.
She's from Pakistan.
Hey, I, uh, have my bike in the van.
You said to bring it by.
Yeah, we can fix it, and then after we're done, I'll run alongside you to make sure you know how to ride it.
Good one, Mr. B.
You roll it in and I'll change my clothes.
Um, hey, dad.
So, Kyle still plans on riding his motorcycle?
It's like that old slogan... you fall off a horse, you want to get right back on it.
That's what I told him.
And there's a 50-50 chance he'll actually bring a horse into the garage.
Hey.
Wow.
It got this messed up in your accident?
It also fell out of my van rounding the corner on Birch Street.
I need to get a back door for my van.
Also a new patio table for that restaurant on Birch Street.
Kyle, you were really lucky to walk away from this accident with a concussion.
I know.
My dreams have been awesome.
No, I mean with nothing worse than a concussion.
You could have had a spinal injury and ended up a paralegal.
Mandy, I know you worry.
And that's why I'll be wearing a helmet from now on.
But please don't tell your dad 'cause I don't want him to think of me as a lady who cares about mussed hair.
No, sweetie, I don't want you riding it at all.
I don't want to lose you in some stupid accident...
Or even a smart one, like whatever happened to Stephen Hawking.
Really?
Not ride anymore?
Please.
Okay.
If it means that much to you, I'll sell the bike.
Thank you.
Maybe it's time I get that horse your dad keeps talking about.
Come on, how many dads can say their teenage daughter threw the winning touchdown pass in a football game?
Just you... over and over and over.
Everybody in the parking lot to the homeless guy at the intersection.
Geez, you should have at least given the guy a dollar.
I gave him something better ...an inspirational story.
Come on.
If a teenage girl can throw a touchdown pass on an all-boys football team, the sky's the limit for a 40-year-old alcoholic with a dog on a rope.
Eve was just supposed to kick the ball, not mix it up with those burly boys.
This is a perfect fake field goal.
She rolls out, hits the guy in the end zone, and touchdown!
Touchdown, Woodbridge High!
Yes!
I was scared to death.
But my girl sure throws a sweet spiral.
That was a perfectly designed play.
I take back everything I said about that stupid coach.
Well, maybe he finally heard you.
I don't think so.
He still wears that ugly visor.
Yeah, we get it.
You've been to Seaworld.
Please, can you try to contain your enthusiasm in front of Mandy and Kristin.
They already feel like you favor Eve.
It would be weird if they didn't.
I make it pretty obvious.
Ah!
Hey, hey!
Touchdown!
Yeah!
There's my football hero!
Your mom has been bragging about you since the game.
We're a little worried about your sisters, though...
Silver and Bronze.
Honey, shouldn't you be out celebrating with the team?
I don't really feel like celebrating.
Why not?
The coach benched me.
- After winning the game?
!
- Honey...
I take back everything I took back about that guy.
Why did the coach bench you?
You executed his play perfectly.
Yeah, but it wasn't his play.
He wanted me to kick the field goal and tie the game, but I had a better idea... winning.
So, you disobeyed his order.
Honey, imagine if everyone did that on the team.
Yeah, we'd be undefeated.
I mean, dad gets it.
Happy, Mike?
Huh?
I mean, she only did this because of the way you constantly undermine her coach in front of her.
So, in a way...
I won this game.
Kyle, we're out of sugar and cream.
Oh, yeah.
Mr. Alzate said they're unhealthy, so it all went in the dumpster, along with the chips and the doughnuts.
The guys aren't too happy.
I bet the raccoons are excited, huh?
Yeah, Mr. Alzate wants us to watch what we eat, but as usual, raccoons get to do whatever they want.
Where's Ed?
Uh, he's in the break room doing yoga.
Ed in yoga pants...
That'll stop people from eating.
And now let's all fold forward.
Ohh, one vertebrae at a time.
Namaste, Mikey.
Nama-stay away from me.
You smell like armpits and incense.
That's the smell of saving money.
I figured out a way to cut back on our health-insurance costs.
We get a big break by encouraging healthy habits and exercise.
You know, the customers down on the floor are getting a lot of exercise walking around looking for salespeople.
Come on.
It's... it's just 40 minutes a day.
I'm gonna whip these fatties into shape.
Yeah, and what we save in healthcare, we're paying in lawsuits for calling people "fatties."
So, uh, is your girlfriend working here now?
She's a first-rate yoga instructor.
If she gets me any more limber, I won't even need a girlfriend.
Hey, Mike, there's a yoga mat right here with your name on it.
Who wants to see Mike in the yoga class?
Hey!
Who wants to get fired?
And fold forward.
I'm telling you, Mike, our guys are loving yoga.
A little grumbling at first.
It's probably their stomachs.
As soon as you left the room, they headed down to the dumpster to fight those raccoons for the doughnuts.
I hear running and fighting are two very good forms of exercise.
Listen, at Outdoor Man, we love our employees.
We want them healthy.
But what you're saying is they're not good enough the way they are.
They aren't.
But...
You're saying it.
I'm tired of being on the hook for their risky lifestyles.
What risky lifestyles?
Half of them are out of shape, and the fit ones are doing very dangerous stuff like snowmobiles...
We sell these.
...jet skis, and... and...
and rock-climbing.
We can't dictate what our employees do in their free time.
We can, if they want to stay our employees.
If they stub a toe, our insurance rates go up.
Uh you, come in.
Uh, that's enough.
Come on down here.
Come on.
Come on.
Leave the dangerous activities to our customers.
Let them kill themselves.
It doesn't cost us anything.
Except return customers.
If we want healthy employees, let's make happy employees.
Let them do stuff that they want to do in their own free time.
If they want to rock-climb, parasail, or eat fried carnival foods, I don't care.
H-hey, Mr. B.
I need to talk to you about my motorcycle.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
This is a perfect example of that.
This kid does a swan dive off his motorcycle, hits the street.
Does he stop riding motorcycles because it's risky behavior?
Actually, that's what I really want...
No, he does not because it makes him happy.
We're gonna get better brakes on it, new tires, get a better safety suit, and you get back out there.
Yeah.
It would be nice to hit the road again.
Right, and, you know, just don't lead with your head this time.
Hey.
Oh, wow, how was practice?
Brutal.
While the rest of the team was watching game film, coach punished me by making me run the bleachers 50 times...
In full pads.
Aah, more stairs.
Maybe it'll be better tomorrow.
Oh, it's definitely gonna be better tomorrow because I'm quitting the team, and don't try to talk me out of it.
You know what?
I never wanted you to play football in the first place.
But I hate to see you quit something just because it's not going your way.
Well, you're about to be 0-for-2.
Ow.
Ow.
Ah, screw it.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
- Hey, Kyle.
Hi.
- Hey, Mrs. B.
- How's your head feeling?
- Great.
Mandy got me this burn ointment that really worked wonders.
It also turned out to be pretty effective at curing what doctors called
"an appalling case of athlete's foot."

I am, you idiot.
I guess those craftmatic adjustable beds do more of the work than I thought.
It is not uncommon for a fit man in his prime to continue siring children.
Picasso had a son at 70.
Did you see the picture of that kid?
He's got two ears on the same side of his head.
Well, I'm really happy for you, Mr. Alzate.
This is a wonderful thing, Mike.
Come on.
This is my last chance to have a son.
It's your last chance to do a lot of things.
You'll be going out when the kid's coming in.
Maybe you can wave at him in that weird tunnel they talk about.
"Hey."
You're not gonna ruin this for me, Mike.
You can make all the jokes you want.
Okay, how about Wendi?
She'll be, you know, cleaning diapers and wiping up drool and taking care of the baby.
What were you thinking?
I wasn't.
All right, I'm not about to start now.
Just a second.
Just a second here.
Here you are right here.
Something to soak up the alcohol.
Hold my calls.
Well, I guess we can go back to being risk-takers.
I was worried Mr. Alzate was gonna tell me
I couldn't ride my motorcycle anymore.
Only one person can make that decision for you.
- Me.
- No, me.
And I don't think you should ride that motorcycle anymore.
Is this because of Obamacare?
You know, I'd like to blame Obama because literally everything's his fault.
This isn't about that.
It's about somebody in your life who cares about you.
You know, somebody who's worried sick, frightened that you might get hurt.
You know what I'm talking about?
I get it.
Message received.
- Okay.
- I love you, too, Mr. B.
Oh, my God, what the hell have I done?
!
Now he's thinking about it.
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man with a word on the affordable care act.
Yowch!
If nothing else, it should motivate us to never get sick.
You know, people have a lot of crazy ideas how to stay healthy.
And no matter what they do or how miserable it makes them, they always say the same thing, right?
"Oh, yeah, I-I-I've never felt better."
For instance, lemon water, maple syrup, and a dash of cayenne pepper.
This is called "the master cleanse."
South of the border, it's just called "tap water."
I call it "don't stand between me and a bathroom."
You drink nothing but this for 10 straight days...
What do the survivors say when they're finished?
"I've never felt better."
My question is, how bad were you feeling before?
Do you remember Jim Fixx?
Pretty much invented jogging, Jim.
Mm-hmm.
You know what else he invented?
Dropping dead while jogging.
You know what his last words were as he was lying on the pavement, clutching his chest?
"I'm pretty sure I've felt better."
Anything good or bad taken to extreme is bad.
Nike's motto is "Just do it."
Not just "do it until you're lying on the sidewalk and someone standing over you going "hey, aren't you Jim Fixx?"
"Last Man Standing" is recorded in front of a live studio audience.
It's bad enough we lost the game.
I didn't even get to play.
Well, look at the upside.
I don't have to wash your uniform.
Your dad is happy 'cause you spent the night with football players and didn't see any action.
It's coach Foster's fault we keep losing.
I mean, he always calls the same five plays.
Yeah, is one of those plays get sacked and lose six yards?
That's the only play you guys seem to have.
I don't think we should criticize Eve's coach in front of her.
He's no Vince Lombardi.
He's not even Vince, that weird kid that bags our groceries.
He's not a kid.
He's 40.
And what bagger Vince lacks in skills, he makes up for in hugs.
I just thought being the kicker on the football team would be a little more fun.
I mean, losing sucks.
Honey, you got to take the bad with the good.
I mean, isn't that one of those life lessons that sports is supposed to teach you?
No.
Losing coach says that so the kids won't cry on the bus.
Kyle just called and said that he crashed his motorcycle.
- What?
- Oh, my God, my poor boyfriend.
Is it serious?
Well, we've been together for two years, but now is no time to talk about that.
He's hurt.
Oh, there you are, son.
- Glad you're okay.
- Yeah.
Good thing he hit his head...
Something he doesn't use here at work.
Yeah, the, uh, doctor said I got a pretty nasty bump on the back of my head.
Back of your head?
What's this, then?
The front of my head.
You can tell 'cause it's got a face on it.
Why the bandage?
Oh, this happened after the accident.
I, uh, burnt my forehead on the muffler.
Did you know you're supposed to wait for your bike to cool down before you work on it?
Yes.
So, you were not wearing a helmet.
As Mr. B says, "helmets are for ladies who don't want to muss their hair."
Or if you're being shot out of a cannon.
And if you don't wear a helmet doing that, you're just showing off.
Why don't you just go home, take a little rest day, hmm?
No, no, the doctor said I need to stay awake for 24 hours, which shouldn't be hard because I slept like a baby after the crash...
A baby flashing in and out of consciousness and occasionally vomiting.
There should be a law forcing a kid that careless to wear a helmet.
And not just on a motorcycle... all day long.
We value our freedoms here in Colorado.
You don't have to put a helmet on.
You can ride your motorcycle right to the pot store, and then come here and buy yourself a rifle.
It's amazing anyone's still alive here in Colorado.
Stupid accidents like Kyle's, though, can raise our health-insurance costs.
I'm already paying more to meet the new Obamacare requirements.
And I thought if you liked your present healthcare plan, you could keep it.
Now they're making us add stuff like vision care and birth control.
If women get vision care, our men won't need birth control.
Sounds like you're more interested in the bottom line than Kyle's head.
Kyle's head is a lost cause.
We should consider cutting our employees to part time...
No.
So we don't have to pay for their healthcare.
We take care of our employees at Outdoor Man.
We always have, and we always will.
If I cut them loose, they can get their own plan on the private exchange.
I don't think so.
Anybody who can figure out that exchange is too smart to be working here.
Ohh.
Oh, hey, don't be stingy, mom.
I've got to carbo-load for tomorrow night's game.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, none for me.
- I'm gonna peach-pie-load later.
- Oh.
So, Ed is seriously considering canceling the employee healthcare plan?
As serious as a heart attack.
If anybody at work wants a heart attack, they better do it now.
And you know what?
I blame this on your president.
You said that last month when it hailed.
I cannot believe you are still railing against Obamacare.
Wasn't that, like, 10 fake scandals ago?
Well, we all agree he screws up a lot, but I prefer his earlier, classic screw-ups.
I think it's a nice impulse to give more Americans insurance.
But that's not his job.
Who does he think he is, that cooler black dude on the allstate commercials?
Well, I'm grateful to the president that Kyle was covered for his accident.
Well, the feds had nothing to do with it, you know.
We took care of Kyle at Outdoor Man.
We take care of our employees because we choose to.
It's like when I choose to empty the dishwasher.
It's great because I choose it.
It's the right thing to do.
It's better than when your mom nags me to do it.
When have you ever emptied the dishwasher?
I'm just making a point.
Okay.
- Oh, hey, Kyle.
- Hi.
Hey, sorry to disturb your dinner.
You hungry, Kyle?
Oh, no, it's okay.
I ate at Denny's.
Not the restaurant, my neighbor.
I ate with him and his wife, ihop.
She's from Pakistan.
Hey, I, uh, have my bike in the van.
You said to bring it by.
Yeah, we can fix it, and then after we're done, I'll run alongside you to make sure you know how to ride it.
Good one, Mr. B.
You roll it in and I'll change my clothes.
Um, hey, dad.
So, Kyle still plans on riding his motorcycle?
It's like that old slogan... you fall off a horse, you want to get right back on it.
That's what I told him.
And there's a 50-50 chance he'll actually bring a horse into the garage.
Hey.
Wow.
It got this messed up in your accident?
It also fell out of my van rounding the corner on Birch Street.
I need to get a back door for my van.
Also a new patio table for that restaurant on Birch Street.
Kyle, you were really lucky to walk away from this accident with a concussion.
I know.
My dreams have been awesome.
No, I mean with nothing worse than a concussion.
You could have had a spinal injury and ended up a paralegal.
Mandy, I know you worry.
And that's why I'll be wearing a helmet from now on.
But please don't tell your dad 'cause I don't want him to think of me as a lady who cares about mussed hair.
No, sweetie, I don't want you riding it at all.
I don't want to lose you in some stupid accident...
Or even a smart one, like whatever happened to Stephen Hawking.
Really?
Not ride anymore?
Please.
Okay.
If it means that much to you, I'll sell the bike.
Thank you.
Maybe it's time I get that horse your dad keeps talking about.
Come on, how many dads can say their teenage daughter threw the winning touchdown pass in a football game?
Just you... over and over and over.
Everybody in the parking lot to the homeless guy at the intersection.
Geez, you should have at least given the guy a dollar.
I gave him something better ...an inspirational story.
Come on.
If a teenage girl can throw a touchdown pass on an all-boys football team, the sky's the limit for a 40-year-old alcoholic with a dog on a rope.
Eve was just supposed to kick the ball, not mix it up with those burly boys.
This is a perfect fake field goal.
She rolls out, hits the guy in the end zone, and touchdown!
Touchdown, Woodbridge High!
Yes!
I was scared to death.
But my girl sure throws a sweet spiral.
That was a perfectly designed play.
I take back everything I said about that stupid coach.
Well, maybe he finally heard you.
I don't think so.
He still wears that ugly visor.
Yeah, we get it.
You've been to Seaworld.
Please, can you try to contain your enthusiasm in front of Mandy and Kristin.
They already feel like you favor Eve.
It would be weird if they didn't.
I make it pretty obvious.
Ah!
Hey, hey!
Touchdown!
Yeah!
There's my football hero!
Your mom has been bragging about you since the game.
We're a little worried about your sisters, though...
Silver and Bronze.
Honey, shouldn't you be out celebrating with the team?
I don't really feel like celebrating.
Why not?
The coach benched me.
- After winning the game?
!
- Honey...
I take back everything I took back about that guy.
Why did the coach bench you?
You executed his play perfectly.
Yeah, but it wasn't his play.
He wanted me to kick the field goal and tie the game, but I had a better idea... winning.
So, you disobeyed his order.
Honey, imagine if everyone did that on the team.
Yeah, we'd be undefeated.
I mean, dad gets it.
Happy, Mike?
Huh?
I mean, she only did this because of the way you constantly undermine her coach in front of her.
So, in a way...
I won this game.
Kyle, we're out of sugar and cream.
Oh, yeah.
Mr. Alzate said they're unhealthy, so it all went in the dumpster, along with the chips and the doughnuts.
The guys aren't too happy.
I bet the raccoons are excited, huh?
Yeah, Mr. Alzate wants us to watch what we eat, but as usual, raccoons get to do whatever they want.
Where's Ed?
Uh, he's in the break room doing yoga.
Ed in yoga pants...
That'll stop people from eating.
And now let's all fold forward.
Ohh, one vertebrae at a time.
Namaste, Mikey.
Nama-stay away from me.
You smell like armpits and incense.
That's the smell of saving money.
I figured out a way to cut back on our health-insurance costs.
We get a big break by encouraging healthy habits and exercise.
You know, the customers down on the floor are getting a lot of exercise walking around looking for salespeople.
Come on.
It's... it's just 40 minutes a day.
I'm gonna whip these fatties into shape.
Yeah, and what we save in healthcare, we're paying in lawsuits for calling people "fatties."
So, uh, is your girlfriend working here now?
She's a first-rate yoga instructor.
If she gets me any more limber, I won't even need a girlfriend.
Hey, Mike, there's a yoga mat right here with your name on it.
Who wants to see Mike in the yoga class?
Hey!
Who wants to get fired?
And fold forward.
I'm telling you, Mike, our guys are loving yoga.
A little grumbling at first.
It's probably their stomachs.
As soon as you left the room, they headed down to the dumpster to fight those raccoons for the doughnuts.
I hear running and fighting are two very good forms of exercise.
Listen, at Outdoor Man, we love our employees.
We want them healthy.
But what you're saying is they're not good enough the way they are.
They aren't.
But...
You're saying it.
I'm tired of being on the hook for their risky lifestyles.
What risky lifestyles?
Half of them are out of shape, and the fit ones are doing very dangerous stuff like snowmobiles...
We sell these.
...jet skis, and... and...
and rock-climbing.
We can't dictate what our employees do in their free time.
We can, if they want to stay our employees.
If they stub a toe, our insurance rates go up.
Uh you, come in.
Uh, that's enough.
Come on down here.
Come on.
Come on.
Leave the dangerous activities to our customers.
Let them kill themselves.
It doesn't cost us anything.
Except return customers.
If we want healthy employees, let's make happy employees.
Let them do stuff that they want to do in their own free time.
If they want to rock-climb, parasail, or eat fried carnival foods, I don't care.
H-hey, Mr. B.
I need to talk to you about my motorcycle.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
This is a perfect example of that.
This kid does a swan dive off his motorcycle, hits the street.
Does he stop riding motorcycles because it's risky behavior?
Actually, that's what I really want...
No, he does not because it makes him happy.
We're gonna get better brakes on it, new tires, get a better safety suit, and you get back out there.
Yeah.
It would be nice to hit the road again.
Right, and, you know, just don't lead with your head this time.
Hey.
Oh, wow, how was practice?
Brutal.
While the rest of the team was watching game film, coach punished me by making me run the bleachers 50 times...
In full pads.
Aah, more stairs.
Maybe it'll be better tomorrow.
Oh, it's definitely gonna be better tomorrow because I'm quitting the team, and don't try to talk me out of it.
You know what?
I never wanted you to play football in the first place.
But I hate to see you quit something just because it's not going your way.
Well, you're about to be 0-for-2.
Ow.
Ow.
Ah, screw it.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
- Hey, Kyle.
Hi.
- Hey, Mrs. B.
- How's your head feeling?
- Great.
Mandy got me this burn ointment that really worked wonders.
It also turned out to be pretty effective at curing what doctors called
"an appalling case of athlete's foot."
Good news.
Now, on the downside, my feet don't get to be in a textbook.
Oh, Kyle.
Your head looks so much better.
You should see my feet.
I made some lemonade.
You guys want some?
Uh, did you use organic lemons?
Concentrate.
You're right.
I should know this.
All right.
You did.
I'll get the drinks.
So, hey, um, did you find anybody to buy your motorcycle yet?
Uh, well, your dad and I are still fixing it up.
How much are you gonna ask for it?
Actually, nothing.
Okay, I don't want to tell you how to negotiate, but, um, you might want to start, like, a little bit higher.
Uh, Mandy, I'm not selling the bike.
But we both agreed that you wouldn't ride anymore.
I know, but then I realized I'd be less of a man if I didn't ride my bike and eat deep-fried carnival food.
Real men are a dying breed.
That might be because of the motorcycles and the carnival food.
Sounds like you've been talking to my dad.
Really?
I sound that smart?
No.
You're not making any sense.
That part's probably me.
Look, Mandy, I don't want to stop riding my motorcycle.
I don't think it's fair for you to ask me to.
Oh, sorry.
I didn't realize my wanting to keep you alive was so unfair.
That's okay.
I forgive you.
I'm really glad we worked this out.
I was worried you were gonna be mad.
I can't believe Kyle is being so stubborn about this.
Mandy is worried sick because he insists on riding that motorcycle.
She's worried about that?
You know, he won't drive on 470 East 'cause he's afraid he has to pay a troll.
Well, you know what?
Maybe this is a big step for Mandy.
Worrying is the price you pay when you really care about someone.
Which is why I'm so calm all the time.
Why is she trying to clip the dude's wings, you know?
Maybe you should talk to her.
You don't worry when I ride my motorcycle.
Well, honey, Kyle does not have your good judgment.
Remember his indoor barbecue party?
Kyle doesn't.
And, yes, I do.
You do what?
Worry.
Worry.
I worry every time you roar down the driveway on that stupid motorcycle.
And until I hear you come back, I have a pit in my stomach.
Well, you eat a lot of fruit.
Maybe it is a pit.
Come on, Vanessa.
We talked about this.
You said you're okay with me riding the motorcycle.
I know.
I know, honey.
I try to be, but
Worrying is the price I pay for caring about someone.
You know, you... you do dangerous stuff I don't always mention.
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Walking around here looking like you do.
Mm?
Why don't we go upstairs?
Now?
Ah...
Why didn't you say something before we ate half a cake?
I mean...
Blah!
All right, I get your point, yeah.
But let the record show...
I wanted to.
Touchdown, Woodbridge High!
What are you watching the game film for?
Your mom says you're gonna quit.
Well, I like the part where I win.
Or the part where 78 gets his junk stepped on.
Right there.
Ow.
You know, that fake field goal is a gutsy call.
A lot could go wrong on a call like that, huh?
Fumble that snap, overthrow the receiver, get sacked.
The point is I didn't, so...
The point is if you did, the team would have suffered the consequences.
But I didn't.
You told the receiver to post pattern into the end zone.
What if he decided, "wait a minute.
I'm gonna do what I want to do"?
Well, I told him what to do.
Yeah, and you were counting on him to listen, right?
Like the coach was counting on you to listen when he told you to kick the field goal.
Are you comparing me to coach Foster?
I'd have to see you in a Seaworld visor.
Kid, if you join the military, you can't make decisions on your own like this.
War is life-and-death.
This is just football.
Tell that to 78.
Kid's fighting for his life right there.
You don't want me to quit, do you?
I want you to stop coaching the team.
Let the coach do that, even if you think he's doing a bad job.
All right.
Fine.
I'll stick it out.
That's my boy.
Still a girl, dad.
Just let me have this.
What's with the doughnuts?
You're gonna get in trouble.
Mr. Alzate gave up on all the health food.
Now the raccoons are stuck with all those carrot sticks and celery.
You should be the bigger man.
Run down there with a little ranch dressing.
All right.
And I'll see you later at home, my baby.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, care for a doughnut, ma'am?
Oh, no, thanks.
I get enough sugar from this one right here.
Is that how he got you into the van in the first place?
That's my lady.
Look at her go.
We all like to see that.
So, Mr. Alzate, does this mean no more yoga classes?
Yeah, that's it.
I'm gonna stop telling people how to live their lives.
Mike was right... you can't stop our employees from engaging in risky behavior.
As a matter of fact, I've been engaging in a little bit myself.
Wendi is pregnant.
Congratulations, sir.
Who's the father?
I am, you idiot.
I guess those craftmatic adjustable beds do more of the work than I thought.
It is not uncommon for a fit man in his prime to continue siring children.
Picasso had a son at 70.
Did you see the picture of that kid?

She'll be, you know, cleaning diapers and wiping up drool and taking care of the baby.
What were you thinking?
I wasn't.
All right, I'm not about to start now.
Just a second.
Just a second here.
Here you are right here.
Something to soak up the alcohol.

There are lots of problems that plague our regular culture.
Hate, people discriminate against each other.
There's this world where you can come and it's free of a lot of those problems.
If you want to feel welcome, you want to feel loved and accepted for who you are, this is the place to be.
No one cares about where you go to school, or how much money you make, or what the color of your skin is.
All of that is just put to the side.
You don't see any walls.
You see everyone together.
I'm beginning to be who I actually am.
Experiencing EDC really changed my life.
One of the best moments of my entire life.
Only rave left...
I actually threw events for my first time 'cause I wanted somewhere for me and my friends to go to have a good time.
I thought of it being big, but I never thought of it being this big.
Electric Daisy Carnival is so many different things.
People are coming here to be inspired.
- It's a music event.
- It's an art show.
If you go back to the purpose of cathedrals and what people were going for, it was to feel small and spiritually alive.
We have a small city, 115,000 people, which is larger than some towns in America.
You can build a sick production.
You can have the best DJ.
But it is way more magical when you bring the people in, and their energy and their costumes.
That's what takes it to the next level.
I'm 19 years old and I'm from Forney, Texas.
There's not really much going on in Forney.
No one knows what EDC is.
Here it's country music, and Christian music and Lil Wayne, that's it.
I was always bullied a lot because me and the friends that I had were kind of different.
It made me feel kind of depressed and I felt there was no reason to even talk to people.
And that was when I started getting into EDM music and rave culture.
That music changed who I was as a person and completely changed my outlook on life and everything.
I still got lots of internal struggles going on.
I'm dealing with lots of anxiety.
And I can't even drive yet because of my anxiety.
But going out to EDC,
I can forget about all my worries for a little while.
Maybe I'll get all that pent-up stress out of me.
Okay, Google Now, EDC 2013 Las Vegas lineup.
Check out these pictures.
So Above Beyond is playing at Kinetic Field Sunday night.
I'm not going to miss them.
I've never been to EDC.
I've never even been to a massive rave event.
Oh, my gosh, he's here.
Paying for college out of my own pocket, it's been really difficult.
Hey!
I'm super broke, so my boyfriend surprised me with my EDC tickets.
- You ready?
- Yes!
Missing EDC wasn't going to happen.
I was going to walk if I had to.
I looked up the directions and it was about 443 hours, and I was prepared to make that walk if we had to do it.
Bye, house.
I'm so excited!
Load 'em up!
We're going to Electric Daisy Carnival, and we're driving across country all the way from Cape Cod, Mass.
We're going to be all piled
- in Jjay's aunt's RV.
- Whoo!
We all pretty much put our jobs on hold.
I had a great job.
Kind of broke up with my girlfriend.
I left everything just to go on this adventure.
One nice shirt for the trip.
We're going to Vegas.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So I got passport...
EDC tickets.
EDC tickets on...
The EDC tickets are in the bag.
I live in Tokyo, Japan.
It was always my life's dream to move over to Tokyo, and I actually got this position at a large Internet company and it was too good to pass up.
I just graduated from college, and I'm about to start a job at a cancer research center in New York City.
This is the best thing that I could be doing for my career.
I've been with Jim for a year.
But we haven't seen each other in six months.
We're two days, 15 hours and three minutes away from seeing one another.
EDC, it's uplifting.
You let go of everything you got going on at home, work, school.
All your stress, all your worries.
Leave it all behind.
During the daytime, I take care of my little nephew.
He's five years old.
Do you like the type of music Popito likes?
- No.
- No?
- Why?
What's wrong with it?
- Why not?
When I listen to his music, I can't breathe.
You can't breathe?
Why not?
You're holding your breath?
How?
What happens when you listen to...
Right now I'm just finishing up getting my high school diploma, 'cause I've been out of school for a while due to my health complications.
That was very hard on me.
But the first time I listened to electronic dance music,
I was really amazed.
It makes me happy.
It keeps me going.
It keeps me motivated.
Alley-oop.
Oh!
We have to brush our teeth with beer.
It's like this...
Here you go.
Shotgun!
Brother, what, that's still half full!
- Down we go, fellas.
- Let's go.
12:35 and we're on the road finally.
I kind of got stuck driving, so I really can't drink, which is a bummer right now.
There's a whole bunch of us, but only a couple of us actually have licenses to make this drive.
We got McBride right here.
We got Money Mike in the back.
Big Bob for security.
We got Luan, aka Disco Drop.
He's going to drop some tunes.
So I say crank that shit up, big boy.
My artist name is Disco Drop.
And to be out here as a DJ,
I go to these shows 'cause I know one day I'm gonna be onstage, on that main stage, and I promise everybody I will do that.
And last but not least, we got our boy
Michael Ferris, alpha male, right here.
He's with us the whole time.
We're going to bring him to EDC with us.
Michael Ferris was like a brother to me and the rest of the Wolfpack.
He died two months ago.
I was taking finals in law school.
And not only did I spend every day with him at school,
I lived with him last summer.
And it really was incredibly difficult for me.
And this is going to come with us the whole way to Vegas.
The whole way to Vegas.
Might as well hang this up right here right next to the wolf blanket.
You know what I'm saying?
Ferris started the Wolfpack name and the whole idea of it, and his outgoing personality brought us together.
All of us were supposed to go to EDC Las Vegas this summer.
Just tear it up.
Wolfpack in Vegas.
And he started this.
It's not The Hangover.
It's not nonsense.
We're the original Wolfpack.
Let's hang this bad boy up right here for him, you know?
The alpha male of the Wolfpack.
He made us the animals that we are today.
Boom!
Number one.
One, two, three.
Wolfpack!
In one hour and one minute, Jim lands, and we get to start our magical EDC weekend together.
Jim and I really, really want to be in the same city, but we both wanted each other to live our dreams, even if it made things harder for both of us, 'cause that's what will make our partnership stronger in the end.
He texted me.
He landed.
It's not going to be real until I see him.
I don't believe that he's going to be here at all.
Ready for EDC!
Yes!
Are you ready for the best weekend of your entire life?
Yeah.
Jim and I have three, four days together.
We want to maximize our experience in those four days.
- Isn't it nice?
- Oh, my God!
Jesus!
We're really looking forward to the Ferris wheel.
It's every raver's dream to kiss on top of the Ferris wheel, so...
My goal is to make the event better.
I want it to be epic, as it was for me.
When I went to my first underground rave, it was magical.
Everyone was dancing.
People were dressed in all different ways.
People weren't tripping on the guy that was different.
That's what really grabbed me, the energy behind the culture.
So, that's why, for EDC, we really said, "You know what?
"Let's take it to another level."
On stage one alone, almost every piece of scaffolding on the west coast.
500-foot stage.
We've never done a production this big.
There are seven stages.
Over 500 performers.
Tickets for the event sold out very quickly this year.
Three hundred forty-five thousand people bought tickets for EDC before we even announced the DJs.
People travel far and spend all their money to be here.
This is about them, not who's on stage.
I mean, the fans are the headliners.
That's how I truly believe, they're that important.
I want them to know it.
So, I don't want to not deliver.
In order to make this sound as good as it can sound, what are you proposing?
The towers would have to be at 180 feet.
Okay.
And why are we debating whether to do something that's going to make sure the sound is awesome?
The aesthetics.
If you can't see a speaker, you can't hear it.
We can't not have the sound booming, you know?
These ones are in line with the main arrays, aren't they?
Yeah, it's quite normal for Pasquale to be making changes up until the doors are open.
He's definitely a perfectionist.
Do we want to dress 'em up?
Not dress them up, but I would like fire coming off the top.
Or pyro coming off the top.
How do you feel?
Let's do it.
It's not really possible to win an argument with Pasquale by saying it's too much money.
One of the principles of Insomniac is everything is possible.
If something is expensive, then you just have to figure out how you're going to pay for it.
It's pretty badass.
I hope that people walk in and they're wowed, and they see things they didn't expect, and they live in the moment and they're happy, right?
Life is about being happy.
I'd like her to walk by and the owl turns its head with the heart eyes.
We got to get that.
I love his eyebrows.
Pasquale came by tonight...
Let's lace all this with rides.
...and basically moved everything around.
This doesn't work.
This should all be art.
Every time something gets moved, it costs more money.
Why did we shorten this?
Why...
There's not enough pieces because you used the pieces over there.
There's no LEDs left in North America right now.
They're all here.
So, the Electric Daisy Carnival now less than 24 hours away and many ravers are flooding into town.
Turn the bass up!
I didn't feel like I belonged to anything until I found rave culture and electronic dance music.
And I knew instantly this is me, this is who I am.
EDM is not a fad for us.
It's a lifestyle.
I wake up to EDM.
I got to sleep to EDM.
Dusk till dawn, EDM.
We're a rave family.
We're all together as a group.
It's like an open relationship and everybody is seeing everybody.
Some people don't accept us for that.
When we're all together, we can all be ourselves.
We have our careers that we do, right?
- I'm a registered nurse.
- I'm a stripper.
I'm a fireman.
Yeah.
There will be other firefighters there that I know of.
- It's always funny.
I walk by them at raves
- Whoo!
And they look at me like, "Oh, you freak!"
And I'm like, "You don't even know.
"I'm one of you."
We're all going to get married in Vegas.
To each other!
Sorry, Mom.
You have to tie it to that hook.
Like this.
Just completely tie it.
Like this?
But it has to get in.
These bracelets are called Kandi.
Usually at EDC you'll exchange Kandi.
Kandi is mostly like fun to me.
So I think you're exchanging fun.
I told you to tighten it.
Mom!
Mom!
I'm trying to teach him.
I'm trying to teach him.
- Well, I can help, too.
- No, I'm trying to...
How do you think you learned?
Fifteen years ago, Alli took me to my first EDC.
That's the first time I fell in love with her, that night.
It was just one of those things where you just know, "That's the one."
Yes, we have two kids.
I made the own tie.
You didn't teach me how to tie this.
Our family, of course, is just not traditional at all.
Our kids are only 15 and 12, so they're not allowed to go to EDC yet.
We hope one day that the kids can join us at EDC.
They're going to experience energy they've never felt before.
We actually never got married.
So when we went back to EDC last year for the first time,
I looked at her and I'm like,
"You know what?
Let's get married there next year."
- She goes...
- "Let's do it!"
And, um, that's what we're doing.
Ooh!
Hello, Vegas!
Oh!
Look at all the awesome!
It's everywhere!
We're in Vegas!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
We made it!
Vegas!
3,000 miles, big boy!
3,000 miles!
We're here now!
And he didn't drive a single one!
Let's do it.
Crazy lights, toys, Kandi.
Guns.
Check.
Check, check, check.
- Check.
Whoo!
- Oh!
What is that?
Your prom dress?
Yes.
This was my senior prom dress.
My dad wanted me to bring my grandfather's ashes in a pill bottle keychain.
He was like, "Your grandpa would love to be doing that.
"He went and did all kinds of things like that."
I don't know if I can get it in.
They're going to be like, "Oh, this is drugs."
They're going to want to taste him.
"Oh, my gosh!
That's my grandfather's ashes!
You can't."
They'll open it and a gust of wind comes, and there goes my grandpa.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Almost.
- Are you excited?
- So excited.
Okay, so I can go through now?
Okay, thank you.
Rides, girls, music, dancing.
Let's do it!
You get there and you just feel the bass.
And you're like, "I know this song."
We're here.
I play music for all of the people that don't know where they fit in in the world.
Oh, my God!
I'm so excited.
I'm with them.
And I was a raver long before I was a DJ.
Oh, my God.
I'm getting chills.
Oh, my God!
Look at this!
Look at this!
Here we go!
These are all the kids that ate lunch by themselves in high school.
These are the loners.
And they stumbled upon this, and they went,
"Whoa!
I belong here!"
I started crying when we walked through the door.
I didn't think it was going to be this crazy, but it is.
Oh, my God!
I have to go down there and meet my friends.
- Morning!
How are ya?
- Here we go.
EDC!
This is not just an event.
It's a cultural movement.
It's all very positive.
It's almost like Woodstock reinvented.
What's up, EDC!
Are you guys ready to go crazy?
Are you guys ready to write history tonight?
Let me show some hands.
Come on!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
No.
I'm absolutely gobsmacked.
This is history being made right now.
We're involved in it.
It must be a religious experience almost to get here for every dance lover.
Of course I'm excited about playing, but I'm more excited about being here.
After I finish, it's not like I go back to my hotel and go to sleep.
No.
I go and I watch Knife Party.
I watch their show.
I go crazy.
Three hundred thousand people going for the same reason.
Everybody is getting away from home.
They're going on this big vacation.
They're going to get away from all their problems.
And everybody is there under the same electric sky.
I love you!
- EDC, thank you so much!
- I love you!
Thank you!
Whoo!
This is so cool!
Three days of this!
Three days!
Whoo!
Before this beat kicks in,
I just want to tell you guys tonight is not about me or any of the other DJs.
It is all about you guys.
It is about EDC!
Make some noise!
This place is massive.
Jeez!
Stick together, boys.
If you get lost, we meet at the daisy.
Whoa!
And it's moving!
Okay.
Dude, that's a terrible idea!
Where are you going to meet under the daisy?
At the base of the daisy.
- Don't get lost.
Problem solved.
- Yeah.
Okay, so now we're going to the daisy?
Yeah.
It's more fun here.
Can we party now or what?
Yeah, let's go!
I like to call us, um, old candy.
Pull up your pants.
Pull your pants up.
You know, like, you have those candy ravers, we're the old candy.
You know that kind of candy you get when you go to Grandma's house?
That's all stuck together?
That's us.
Just in case there is no toilet paper,
- and you're not into it...
- Or someone pees on the toilet.
There you go.
It's wipeys.
'Cause we're parents and we like to take care of everybody like they're our babies.
Yeah, just show them how to do it when they get older.
It's part of the whole PLUR thing.
Peace, love, unity and respect.
Everybody wants respect and the unity, to make sure everybody is having a good time.
- Keep it going, guys!
- Have a good night, guys!
Basically, night one, we walk around and we kind of get the feel of the grounds.
See what changed from the year before.
You map it out so you don't get lost.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Usually you have a few DJs that you want to see, a few different people back and forth from different stages.
You're the one in control of what you want to do.
No one is going to tell you where to go, who to listen to.
You make your adventure.
Some people take it a little too far.
We've always had a zero tolerance policy when it comes to drugs.
We're an 18-and-over event.
But there's always people who try and see what they can get away with.
And we're here to pick up the pieces if that happens.
Hey, guys.
You okay?
A big part of my job is looking for people who might need medical attention.
What year is it?
2013.
There you go!
We've had some unfortunate incidents over the years at Electric Daisy Carnival.
It's rough for all of our team whenever we have to deal with something like that.
We take it personally.
We work so hard to be proactive and to provide the best possible medical care.
Um, sometimes somebody just makes a poor decision, and we just do the best we can with it.
If you want to go do drugs, that's your own prerogative.
I'm not...
That's your own thing, you know?
- Do you use drugs?
- I do not use drugs.
Why?
Well, for number one, I had a friend who died from a drug overdose.
For Ferris to go the way he did, was...
I can't even come up with the words to really describe how it felt.
That's Ferris right there.
He's like, "Welcome to my playground, boys."
Yeah, right?
I don't need to use drugs.
Some people, they feel they need to take drugs to escape their reality.
My reality is pretty awesome as it is,
- so I don't need to do any of that.
- Yeah!
I love it!
Electronic dance music, that, for me, it's like a therapy.
It's my escape.
Actually, you can say it's my drug, and music is my drug.
It helps me cope with the things I got to go through.
Before EDC, I wasn't doing so good.
I used to dwell a lot on the past, and being able to walk.
I have scoliosis.
I had surgery about six years ago.
And a doctor damaged my spinal cord somehow.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
There's definitely challenges that I face when I go to these festivals.
For me to get through a crowd is a hassle.
Yeah, you have your ADA platforms and whatnot, but I don't like being on a platform,
I like being a part of the crowd, even if I might not get to see the stage.
We got this.
We're not old candy.
We're going home a little early.
It's been a night?
Oh, yeah, crazy night.
Hold on, we got to stretch.
You can't just go full-out the first night.
It's all about pacing yourself.
EDC!
How are you still so pumped?
EDC day one is over.
I'm with new people.
I'm meeting new people.
It doesn't get any better than this.
Day one of three, we had about 100,000 people.
Got two more sunrises to go.
We're trying to get everybody home.
We're transporting about 35,000 people on shuttles.
Day two is coming up.
And if it's just as good as day one,
- if not better...
- It will be.
...then I'm going to be stoked on life.
Oh, my God.
I'm so beat.
Oh!
That was fun.
Day one was crazy!
Dude, I'm exhausted.
We lost Luan.
We don't know where he is.
Don't know what happened to him.
His phone's off.
At first, I was like, "All right.
We'll give him time."
So we just go hang out on the roof of the RV.
We drink some beers, we're laughing, hanging out.
Half an hour goes by, we're like, less and less people in the parking lot.
So what are we going to do about Luan?
How much time are we going to give him?
I say we give him an hour.
- 7:30. 7:30.
- Well, I'm leaving...
Listen, Luan is a smart enough kid to get himself safely to shelter.
What happens if he's in jail?
Dude, he's not in jail.
I'm hoping he's back in Vegas with eight beautiful women at a hotel, waiting for us to get there.
That's what I'm really hoping.
Probably not.
All of a sudden we get this call.
He's just like, "Yo, where are you?"
All right.
The main entrance?
All right, we'll see you soon.
Dude, he's been walking around this whole parking lot all over on that side looking for us.
He didn't...
know where that thing was.
He didn't know where it was.
- For hours, dude?
Wow!
- For hours.
I think I see him.
Yo, Luan!
Yo!
We've been over there.
Where the hell are you even walking?
Like, we didn't leave you.
- Right.
- Yeah, right.
If you didn't leave me,
I would've found you within the first 30 minutes that I looked for you guys.
You want me to tell you everything that's around this... building?
Dude, we didn't...
How'd I get here so fast?
You want me to tell you everything around this building?
- Because I walked around and...
- Did you walk that far?
I did.
I crossed this parking lot, that parking lot, this parking lot and this parking lot.
You guys were nowhere to be found.
Dude, it was way back there.
Next time I'm driving, I'll remember that.
You're being emotional.
You walked all the way to that back parking lot?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The truck was not there.
We didn't move.
You.
We didn't move.
Dude!
He thinks we left him.
We never left you.
Losing a friend kind of sets your mind to not take for granted every moment you have with a friend.
Let the little things slide off.
You just enjoy and live in the moment.
Ferris died right before his 25th birthday.
He's the last person in the world you would think for it to happen to.
He was so full of energy and life.
Let's turn this thing right around.
Just turn it right around, go get some breakfast.
This bond is very important to me, with Luan.
We work so much together with music that we can't hate each other 'cause we built this thing together.
Our bond has to be strong.
We're in Vegas, we're both trying to make it somewhere in life.
I'm sorry, bro.
All right?
Let's cheer up.
It's EDC week Vegas.
Disco Drop, blow up.
Let's live life, bro.
We don't necessarily look like someone you might call a raver.
No.
We're very, very conservative looking.
But EDM has consistently made us very, very happy.
Jim introduced me to this music.
And actually one of our first dates we went to an Avicii concert.
Brought us really close together.
That heart-soaring, uplifting kind of feeling you get when you listen to that music, it's the same feeling that I get with Jim.
This love that's bigger than yourself.
The last day at EDC, we were going to get married, so we went to a pool party, and it was our bachelor and bachelorette party.
I just love being in my ideal rave world.
A place where people can be themselves and be free of judgment.
A couple years ago I went to EDC 2010, and I was saying to myself,
"Why can't I have this experience at my house?"
I basically created a rave cave.
This is our sensory overload chamber.
We got a smoke machine that injects from the outside so you can see the laser.
Have you had sex in here?
About 1,000 times.
Yeah, absolutely.
I've been a fireman for eight years.
My dad was actually chief of the fire department, and that's all I saw when I was growing up.
I will get made fun of by the other firefighters.
They'll be like, "Whoa!
What's that, rave boy?"
And I get "Glow-stick boy"
all the time.
That one's another good one.
It's hard for me when I go to work to get on the same level as a lot of the other people because I'm not interested in anything that they're interested.
Like, I don't care about bass fishing.
I don't.
I want to go to EDC, that's what I want to do.
A lot of people say, "Oh, you're not
"going to be raving when you get older.
"You're going to grow up and you're gonna do adult things."
I'm like, "No.
I don't think so."
I'm slowly falling into the genre of rap and hip-hop.
There's a guy named Logic.
He just got sponsored by Def Jam.
You know what I think of when I hear Def Jam?
Run DMC.
Great.
Make me look like a bad parent now, now that you don't know who Run DMC is.
Sorry.
My parents are chill.
Epic.
Dope.
I wouldn't say dope.
Alli took me to my first rave.
This was back in the day where you had to call a hotline and they tell you...
It was underground, very underground.
They tell you where to be the next day.
There were no cell phones, there was no Internet.
The flyers were just the only means of communication.
Thanks for calling Nocturnal Wonderland.
We are really excited about you being a part of this event.
Directions will be posted tomorrow afternoon on these voice mails.
Come in peace or don't come at all.
You'd call, you'd go to the map point, get a map and then go to the party.
You'd pride yourself that it was illegal, you would pride yourself it was underground.
Not knowing if it was going to get broken up or not was part of the fun.
I think what captured my imagination when I first started going out to underground, illegal warehouse parties was just total chaos.
Production was crap.
Turntables would break.
The lights were very limited in what they could do.
Stages collapsing.
Crowd-control issues.
I remember one time, I walked down the wrong hall and I stumbled into a quinceanera that was going on at the same time as the rave.
But you immediately got a sense that you had found this secret world where everyone could come together and be as one, essentially.
There were cool parties like Aphrodite's Temple.
- Paw Paw Ranch.
- Gilligan's Island.
Sheba's Erotic Banquet.
Armageddon.
There were a million raves.
It was all love.
It was cool.
But by early '93, it was done.
No one was there for any other reason than to get high.
There was nothing left from the original underground days.
The love was gone.
And I wanted that back.
I started doing events.
ED got bigger.
Twenty years of slowly chipping away and finally we're getting somewhere.
Pasquale really stuck with it over time and made it something really important.
The music's gotten better, the events have gotten better.
The production now is off the charts.
We are turning our subculture into popular culture.
And now it really is mainstream.
But the sensibility of the music is always about what's next.
It's always pushing forward.
It's not limited in any way.
I mean, you can sample and rework and rearrange any kind of instrumentation.
It could be country bluegrass.
To just watch the scene grow is just mind-blowing.
It's just gotten to this whole new place.
I never, ever thought it would get to where it is right now.
We've always listened to EDM.
It's just one of those things that kind of keeps my body alive.
It keeps our energy up.
When the beat drops and 40,000 people are jumping at the same time, you feel that same energy.
Everybody's connected.
When you go somewhere and something is beautiful or something wows you or something is really unique, you leave everyday problems in the past, even if it's for a moment, it's awesome.
We're spreading happiness, we're spreading love.
It's so gratifying.
Not only for me, but our entire team.
Hi, guys!
Pasquale really wants to spread the message of love throughout the party.
And you guys are here to do just that.
I'm responsible for 500 performers that are there specifically to create an experience.
You put better shows on for each other than you do out there, you know that, right?
Everyone that comes to our shows is there more for the experience than for who's playing a set somewhere.
Hey, guys, focus on people who are not having a good time.
That's right.
That's our job, to make people feel something.
We can tell a story through stilt-walkers, ballerinas, clowns or mirror men that jump on the trampolines.
If you reach out and touch somebody, and shake them and go, "I'm here.
"We're here together."
They'll never forget that.
Wow!
Oh, my gosh!
Dude!
You got the music going on and then all the people and the costumes and what they're doing.
There's so much to take in.
It's really crazy.
I really miss me walking around myself.
I can't really walk around anymore.
Before I became famous,
- I was also at these kind of festivals.
- Hey!
Hey!
Just walking around and, discovering new stages, new DJs.
I can only do that from the backstage now.
I love to play music for other people.
When I'm onstage and you see this massive crowd, it's so much energy you get from it.
And it's like I'm flying.
It's one of the best feelings you can have as a human being.
I'm really a socially anxious person.
But I think being in a big crowd of people, where everybody's there for the music, where I don't really have much to worry about,
I've got the music to soothe me and calm me down.
You feel sound waves hitting your body, you feel the bass.
I love it.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I think you can never actually prepare for what you can expect here.
The moment you walk onstage, you see all those people in front of you, you forget about everything.
Everything I do tonight is for the fans.
I'm here for them and I'm going to give them the best time possible.
A group of guys came up to me and were like,
"Yo, you want to go up and crowd surf?"
I was scared, I was nervous, but you only live once.
When I look down, I see the smiles, I see tears,
I see people screaming and cheering me on.
To be above the crowd, I was on top of the world.
I'll always be dancing to the music and it's a great feeling.
To leave everything behind and come to this perfect utopia, where it's just love, light, purity and unity, and I love it.
I'm going home, take a nap.
Tired, sleepy.
Voice is gone.
I need to sleep 'cause I got to be back here tomorrow at 4:00.
I have to get some real sleep.
My body aches.
I'm exhausted.
I'm starving.
It's, like, I'm so exhausted,
I don't even think I can sleep anymore.
Got to go catch a shuttle.
So, we're peacing out, but thanks for the good times and the great memories.
Tonight, I'm getting married to my best friend in the whole wide world.
It's going to be under the super moon under the electric sky.
It's probably one of the most special nights that I'll ever have in my life.
I mean, everything is just lining up.
It's gonna be awesome, it's beautiful.
My nerves are going crazy.
I feel like so many weddings are for other people or appearances or whatever, but you two, it's like...
This is how you fell in love, and this is how you've stayed in love through two kids.
And a billion different changes and everything that's happened in life.
We've just seen too much divorce in our lives, and we wanted to make sure that it stuck.
And I think 15 years pretty much sums it up.
EDC has always been something that no matter what, like you...
Go to happiness.
This is the ultimate fantasy wedding, for sure.
Got my pants here, got my "PLUR" furry on the butt.
Got my "EDC" on the side.
You're like festive fabulous without being raver newbie.
Haven't been a raver newbie since '98.
- Oh, back in the day.
- Back in the day.
Bounce check!
If you're gonna get married, do it the way you wanna do it.
There's no other way to do it.
Here we go.
Going to see Matt for the first time.
Here we go!
Wake up!
Time to get married!
Today's the last day of EDC and, we all plan on getting married.
I don't think that we wanna get married individually, but as a family.
We're getting married on the night of the super moon.
Outrageous.
The super moon is just an added bonus.
I'm super excited.
Every muscle in my body is sore.
And, um, I'm ready to do it again!
EDC, day three.
Guys, are you ready to rock this parking lot?
I can't wait.
Me and Luan are gonna go on the roof and just spin the whole time before we go in, gets ourselves all pumped up.
We got all our favorite tracks.
- We got all our equipment?
- Yeah, everything's in the back.
Tonight is our last night celebrating.
Kind of took over the parking lot, set up a DJ booth, speakers, mixing boards.
- Beautiful, like champs.
- There you go.
EDC is a chance for me to get my music out there.
Michael Ferris was the one that always told me,
"Yo, bro, start showing people this.
Screw it.
"If that's what you want to do,
"chase your dreams, and if you fail, you fail."
And so when I make it, I'll definitely know it's gonna be 'cause of him.
Now we're in Vegas, we're doing this.
We're gonna make it big one day.
Mikey!
Tonight we're gonna try to get Ferris' jersey up as high as we can for the whole crowd, everybody to see.
I'm so pumped up right now.
Happy day three.
Go hard tonight.
Last night, guys.
EDC is like a war of attrition.
It's who can stay out the longest with minimal nutritional intake and rest.
EDC!
It is, day three of Electric Daisy Carnival.
It's rough to keep people safe for three days.
Hi, sweetie.
You good?
- I'm just sleepy.
- Okay, no worries.
When it's hot, our medical cases are through the roof, because people don't drink enough water.
Um, beer is not a substitute for water.
And now you're dancing all night, which causes exhaustion and dehydration.
My chest right here hurts really bad.
Do you have any heart problems or anything like that?
No, no heart problems.
No high blood pressure.
I do have anxiety.
Um, I was having a lot of trouble breathing, and by the third day,
I felt like I couldn't breathe at all.
It felt like somebody was sitting on my chest.
And I was having an anxiety attack, is what the problem was.
Well, I'm okay.
Okay, so how did it all start from the beginning?
I really try not to let the anxiety bring me down at all.
It's there sometimes, but I'm learning how to handle it.
They said they just wanted me to calm down for a little while.
Absolutely.
- Stay chilled out.
- Who's your favorite DJ?
Above Beyond, they're playing tonight.
They're gonna have to drag me out of here on a stretcher before I miss my favorite DJs.
- Hey, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah!
Don't say that, don't say that.
Take care of yourself, okay?
- All right, no problem.
Thanks.
- All right.
EDC Las Vegas!
If you know the words, I would like you to sing along.
What's up, guys?
- How's it going?
- You guys doing great?
Yes, sir.
With all the excitement before our wedding,
I have so many butterflies.
I'm just a hot mess.
- Hi!
- Hey!
People always ask me, "Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"
In all honesty, I hope I'm exactly where I am right now, because I don't want anything more, what I have right now, it's awesome.
The rings you're about to exchange are the symbols of an unbroken circle.
Please place the ring...
There you go.
With the power vested in me and all of EDC,
I now pronounce you partners in life.
You can seal it however you want to.
Go!
We've been together for 15 years.
So, we've been thinking about this a lot.
We wanted a real wedding, so I asked my friend to get ordained, and, he was like, "Okay, sure."
We've been doing EDC since I met him.
It's the perfect tie-in for this moment.
Looking at her coming towards me, it's like the light at the end of the tunnel.
But the light is actually coming towards you.
By the power vested in me by the state of Nevada,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Whoo!
Happiness and relief and joy all bundled into one.
Unforgettable.
Yeah, exactly.
This is the only word I can have for that.
It was just an epic night.
Just the peace with each other, the unity, the respect.
- Love.
- The love.
It all ties in.
Pretty soon we have to say goodbye.
And then fly away to our respective places on the opposite corners of the globe.
And then after EDC, we won't see each other for at least four months.
We're not gonna think about drama tomorrow.
We're not gonna talk about goodbyes, 'cause we want to enjoy our last day at EDC.
Here we are one last time under the electric sky.
It's been a long journey.
Raving, having fun, ups and downs.
We've been going pretty crazy the past three days.
This is the finale, the end all be all, and I plan on going out with a bang.
To end my weekend here at EDC,
I'm going to have my grandpa with me to experience my favorite DJs, Above Beyond.
I think my grandpa would be really proud of me being right here right now.
He was never into the corporate stuff and was always like,
"F the government," kind of thing.
So, I'm sure he'd really like an event like this.
I'm really glad I got to get him in.
It's not just about the music, it's about the people coming together to enjoy it.
Whatever we do with the show, it should help people feel more connected with the music.
It should bring people in.
Then the magic really happens.
We ended up making our way to nearly the front of the crowd.
That jersey is gonna fly.
We want the entire stadium to remember the name Michael Ferris, and that EDC knows that he's here with us forever.
We're holding up his jersey, waving it around.
'Cause he's here with us.
You can't convince me he's not.
We have fun onstage.
We've been doing the push-the-button thing at a lot of the shows.
Basically, at some point in the set, we'll get someone up onstage to restart the records.
It's something very simple, but we wanna make it really special.
Hello, my darling.
What's your name?
- Sadie.
- Sadie.
I have no idea what's about to happen, but I have a feeling it's gonna be a big deal.
Right now?
I got to press the button for the biggest crowd in the country at the biggest festival in the country.
I have no words for it.
There's no words to describe what I just got to do.
I got to see things from the DJs' point of view.
There's so many people.
The is the coolest, most awesomest moment of my life.
It's been such a positive experience.
You can't lose that.
That's the whole point in it.
It's supposed to be an inspiration for you to take it out everywhere else to everybody that you meet.
When we held up that jersey, I knew he was with us.
All I saw in my head was Ferris cracking up like, "You guys did it.
"Hey, thank you so much."
Thanking us.
I was so happy to show him the, biggest and best party one last time.
It was awesome.
Looking at what this is today from what it was when it started blows me away.
Those experiences from those underground events, bringing people together, breaking boundaries, it's still happening.
The spirit's there, and this year it was on another level for us.
I hope people out there that never experience EDC,
I hope they don't have a misconception about it.
The culture behind it, of being one, of being a family, if people can just treat each other like people treated each other at EDC, this world would be a lot better place.
I get more love in these events than I do out in the streets, honestly.
You know what I mean?
It's a place where I call home.
And if you wanna feel welcome, you wanna feel loved and accepted for who you are, this is the place to be.
This has absolutely been the greatest experience of my whole life.
If I start getting stressed out, I can just remember how many people was I with at this event who are also going through so much, and we all were able to just let go.
I can just calm myself down, take a deep breath and move forward.
In more ways than one, it's going to feel like
I'm really putting on a costume over there.
And I know that sounds a little bit silly, 'cause it's the costume that I have to wear every day.
A suit, a straight face.
Not looking forward to it too much.
It's been the best weekend of our life.
I feel depleted.
Um, lack of food, lack of sleep.
The partying that we really did, dancing nonstop.
I can't wait to get home.
I can't wait to get in my bed.
The things we saw, the things we did...
My aunt is going to kill me.
I am so scared to bring this RV back to her.
All right.
So we gotta go all the way back there.
His gravesite's right under that rainbow.
Right there.
That really is exactly where it is.
Ferris was so adamant about enjoy the moment while you can.
Enrich your life as much as possible while you can, when you can.
You never know what's gonna happen.
Oh, man, I accept that he's gone.
Sad, but at the same time it's like he's with us everywhere we go.
It's okay, big guy.
When we huddled up right over...
Wolfpack lives on.
It felt like we were back together again.
Wolfpack chant, bro.
Wolfpack chant on three, straight up.
Three, two, one.
- Wolfpack!
- Chant!
Whoo!
This week is forever gonna be in our heads as the craziest, best trip of our lives.
We all came together to heal each other.
100% worth it, every sacrifice each and every one of us made.
Whether it be losing our job, having no money, losing relationships.
It doesn't matter what we gave up, because we now have the best story of our lives.
Previously, on Teen Wolf...
Scott:
It's a dead pool.
A hit list of supernatural creatures.
Why would someone use all this money just to kill us?
I know exactly who The Benefactor is.
Meredith.
It was your idea.
I will take out all of them!
Is it over?
I'm not a murderer.
Liam:
But you are a predator.
Derek:
My strength, the healing.
Derek:
All of it.
Scott:
Gone?
Whatever Kate did to me, it's still happening.
(SCREAMS)
Stiles:
Banshees predict death.
You wanna bail on the plan.
Not when I'm this close to killing Scott McCall.
(GROWLING)
We're all going to church!
Stiles:
Mexico.
Scott!
Chris:
You ever heard of the Berserkers?
Derek:
They wore the skins of bears to channel their ferocity.
No, Kate.
Don't.
(SCREAMING)
(GASPS)
Scott?
(BREATHING RAGGEDLY)
- (GROWLS) - (SCREAMS)
(KIRA GRUNTING)
(GROWLING)
I'm going to have to do a better job of covering that up.
What did you do to him?
How.
That's...
That's the better story.
You see, when I first got away from the Calaveras,
I had no idea where to go.
But something kept pulling me here, to the temple of Tezcatlipoca.
His name means "smoking mirror"
and this place is a temple of the smoking mirror.
Obsidian.
When I got here, I found the Berserkers waiting for me.
They helped me survive.
I didn't know quite why until just recently.
(SCOFFS)
Until I decided to trust someone
I never thought I'd trust.
It was then that I found out
I could not only control the Berserkers, but I could create them.
They call me La Loba.
"The Bone Woman."
We let you out because I needed to test his loyalty.
Did you know that Scott became an Alpha without having to kill anyone?
He's been through quite a lot without ever having to kill.
I think it's time to change that.
(GASPING) No, Scott.
No, Scott, no.
(GASPS)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
You're not going to Mexico.
Dad, Scott and Kira have been kidnapped and taken to Mexico.
Okay?
I think that's a pretty good reason for a trip to Mexico.
(INHALES) Okay.
- Even if Deaton is right about this...
- Yeah.
The best thing to do is to go through the proper channels.
- Dad...
- That means calling the right law enforcement agencies, border patrol, putting out an all-points.
Dad, I can't just wait around for the wheels of bureaucracy to start spinning in five different government offices.
Okay?
Someone needs to go down there right now, find them and rescue them.
I'm going.
- I can keep you from going.
- (MUSIC PLAYING)
I'd find a way.
I can throw you in a cell.
I'd still find a way.
(SIGHS) Stiles, please.
Just give me a little more time to verify something slightly more concrete than a psychic vision by some guy with a third eye!
Look, I will call every law enforcement agency all the way down to South America if I have to.
If nothing turns up, then I'll book two flights to Mexico.
We'll both go.
Okay?
Okay, okay, great.
Do I get a gun?
No.
(SIGHS) I still don't like relying on these things.
I get it.
You miss your power.
I would, too.
It's not about power, it's about being able to help.
I don't like feeling helpless.
I'm human.
Do I look helpless?
You're a much better shot than me.
Do you really think you won't be coming back?
Not alive.
You know I'm not okay with that.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(SIGHS)
I am.
If it saves Scott and Kira.
But to be honest, I don't even know if this is enough firepower to take down one Berserker.
Peter:
Not even close.
(TITTERS)
Killing a Berserker is next to impossible.
It's not just the firepower, it's breaking the animal spirit from the human.
Well, the one person we know with that kind of experience is Argent.
And he's not getting back to me.
Well, then you're going to need help.
Like Malia, maybe Liam.
Definitely me.
Here, try that.
Fabric softener.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Remember, Scott's life is on the line.
(SNIFFS)
Yeah.
That works, too.
Oh!
Liam, go home.
You're not coming with us.
Why not?
Because it's a full moon.
And I don't feel like driving all the way down to Mexico just to have you rip my throat out.
You can lock me up, right?
Chain me down to the back seat or something?
You tore through the last chains, remember?
Yeah, we would have to freeze you in carbonite to get you down there.
Okay, then where do we get carbonite?
Seriously, you haven't seen it either?
Wait!
What if we put me in the trunk?
You'd get out of that, too.
Liam, you've been a werewolf all of five minutes.
You don't have to do this.
I know I don't, but I want to.
There's gotta be bigger chains, a bigger trunk or something.
There has to be.
Maybe there is.
Stiles:
How did you get a prison transport van?
I'm a U.S. Marshal.
Yeah, I just thought that was just a cover.
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
Are we really bringing him?
Are we really bringing him?
We're bringing everyone that we can.
And considering Scott and Kira were taken the night before a full moon, we should probably get going.
What's that mean?
If Kate took Scott back to the same temple that she took Derek, how do we know she's not planning to do the same thing to him?
What, she wants to make him younger?
Or take him back to when he wasn't a werewolf.
Peter:
A werewolf can't steal a true Alpha's power.
But maybe a Nagual jaguar, with the power of Tezcatlipoca behind her...
Maybe she can.
So, if everyone is sufficiently freaked out,
I say we get going.
Stiles:
We can't.
Not without Lydia.
(SNIFFS)
I hope this works.
(LOW GROWL)
Derek:
What's she doing at the school anyway?
We got Kira's sword, but we need something with a stronger scent.
Lydia went to get a jacket out of her locker.
Nothing.
If she has a car, she can catch up to us.
That's a good point.
We'll call her from the road.
No.
What if something happened?
What if she's in trouble?
Fine.
You stay, you find her.
We're gonna go on without you.
Liam:
I could call Mason.
He has a study group at school.
Maybe he could look for her.
(SIGHS) All right.
Fine.
I need to be back there with Derek and Liam.
I've got some experience dealing with out-of-control teen wolves.
You'll be okay riding with Peter?
He is my father.
Maybe we could do some bonding.
No.
No bonding.
Play the radio, play it loud.
Peter:
Remember what we're dealing with.
It's not just Kate, it's Berserkers.
You might see human eyes behind those skulls.
Do not assume that there's any humanity left.
Oh.
This little one is terrified of them, aren't you?
Don't worry, my friend.
It is that fear that will keep you alive.
A reminder to everyone.
You do not fight Berserkers to survive, you fight to kill.
(LOW GROWL)
Yeah, her car's here.
You want me to look around the school and see if I can find her?
Liam:
Yeah, definitely.
Call me as soon as you find her.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
All good?
Okay.
I brought something to help you.
This has been with my family for centuries.
It's a very powerful, supernatural talisman.
We use it to teach Betas how to control themselves on a full moon.
Yes, it's powerful. (CLEARS THROAT)
Very powerful.
Lydia?
No wonder she's not answering.
What the hell?
(GROWLS)
(MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY ON RADIO)
Do you mind if I turn the radio down?
(LOWERS VOLUME)
You worried about Stiles?
I'm worried about everyone.
Do I need to be worried about you?
We have to go through the Berserkers to get to Kate.
Then we have to go through Kate to get to Scott and Kira.
Trust me, it's going to get messy.
Scott says we don't kill people.
You think
Scott would kill to save Kira?
Would you?
Kill to save Stiles?
What is it?
The full moon. (SIGHS)
Good.
You'll need that power.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(GRUNTING)
Whatever you were gonna teach me... (BREATHING HEAVILY)
I think you better start.
(GROANING)
Noshiko:
It's all right to cry.
It's no measure of your strength.
But I'm not strong.
I need to get up.
I need to tell them...
How do you know you can't?
Because I'm not healing.
You told me why I never get sick.
And you said I'd learn to heal.
Then learn.
I can't.
I don't know how...
How to start.
Or what to do...
I told you once that foxes and wolves tend not to get along.
But they are similar creatures, aren't they?
You've seen wolves heal.
How do they do it?
Kira, how do they trigger it?
Pain. (BREATHING HEAVILY)
With pain.
(GROANING)
(GROANING)
Are you okay?
My head...
Oh.
Yeah, it's probably gonna hurt a lot.
There was this guy.
Huge, really huge.
He had a, a skull on his face.
Yeah.
I know.
I saw it, too.
My phone's gone.
Yeah.
I think that's the point.
Okay.
Well, why, what's he gonna do to us?
I don't know.
But it definitely doesn't want us to leave.
Lydia, why do you keep saying "it"?
(CREATURE GROWLS)
(GASPING)
What is that thing?
Not human.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Liam, you with me?
We have a mantra that we use.
You repeat it, you focus on the words.
It's like meditating.
You say the words until you feel control coming back to you.
Okay.
Okay, okay!
What are the words?
Okay, look at the triskelion.
See the symbol?
I have a tattoo on my back, it's the same thing.
Each spiral means something.
Alpha, Beta, Omega.
It represents the idea that we can always rise to one and fall back to another.
Betas can become Alphas.
Alphas can become Betas.
Can Alphas become Omegas?
All you have to do is say the three words.
And with each one, you tell yourself you're getting calmer, more in control.
Go ahead.
Alpha, Beta...
Slower.
Alpha...
Beta...
Omega... (GROANING) Alpha...
Beta...
Omega...
Good.
Say it again.
Remember, every time you say the words, you're getting calmer.
Alpha, Beta...
- Omega.
- Say it again.
Derek, I don't think the powerful talisman of self-control is working.
(GRUNTING)
Liam, say it again!
(ROARING)
Liam!
(LIAM ROARING)
(GROANING)
Derek?
I think we're gonna need to go a little faster.
Keep going!
(ROARS)
(GRUNTS)
Derek:
Liam!
Liam...
We're almost there.
You're trying to stay in control?
Trying to stay human.
That's exactly your problem.
Scott has you thinking that control and humanity are the same for us.
Now, let me give you some fatherly advice.
If you're gonna face something as animal as a Berserker and try to win, you need to focus on the animal inside you.
You'll need every ounce of ferocity and savagery you can muster.
You'll need it.
(GROANING) Keep focus!
Derek, I don't think Alpha, Beta, Omega is resonating with him.
You know any other mantras?
(LIAM GROANING)
Yeah.
I do.
Liam, Liam.
What three things cannot long be hidden?
- (GROANING)
- Liam!
Liam, look at me.
What three things cannot long be hidden?
Stiles:
What three things?
(LIAM GRUNTS)
(PANTING) Sun...
The moon...
The truth.
That's it.
Say it again.
(LIAM GRUNTING)
Sun, the moon...
The truth.
Derek?
We're okay.
Sun...
Moon...
And the truth.
I can't believe I did it. (SCOFFS)
For a minute there, I thought I was gonna tear the two of you apart.
Yeah.
That would've made for an awkward ride home.
So, thanks.
Think you can bring the same level of control and strength inside La Iglesia?
All right.
We might actually be able to do this.
(GRUNTING)
(GROWLING)
(GUNSHOTS)
(GRUNTING)
How bad is it?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Just get to Scott.
Just find him.
We'll be right behind you.
Go.
Go!
Hey, hey, save him.
(GRUNTING)
(GROANING)
Lydia was right.
Okay, everyone stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
We gotta figure out where we are, then we gotta figure out how to find Scott and Kira.
How do I even have service...
Hi, Dad.
Okay, Dad, I know you're angry.
Stilinski:
Oh, I'm beyond angry.
I've reached a level of fury that you could not possibly comprehend.
Okay, well, when I get back, you can ground me.
Ground you?
Ground you?
I'm going to hobble you!
Now, please, tell me you're all right.
Tell me that you're safe.
You want me to lie?
Oh, God.
Okay.
Tell me, tell me what I can do.
How can I help?
She was at the school when we called Mason to look for her, but now we're not hearing back from either of them.
I don't know, Dad, I don't know what I'm doin'.
You know, I'm just...
I'm trying to save my friends.
Okay.
I'll find Lydia and Mason.
You get Scott and Kira.
You save your friends.
Dad, if it's one of the Berserkers at the school, you're gonna need firepower.
A lot.
What do we do now?
Duck. (GRUNTS)
Go back.
Get back!
Go!
Go, go, go, go!
Can you still pull a trigger?
Yeah.
All right.
Stay with me.
You're gonna be okay.
It's a mortal wound.
And right now I'm feeling pretty mortal.
- (SIGHS)
- I'm not gonna let you die.
(GROWLING IN DISTANCE)
(SIGHS)
Eh, you might just have to concentrate on saving yourself.
(SIGHS)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(SOFTLY) I don't hear it.
- Come on.
- No, no.
There's only one way out on this side of the basement.
I know.
But if we don't get out of here, someone's going to die.
- How do you know that?
- I just do.
We have to at least see if he's blocking the exit.
(SIGHS)
(GASPS)
Yeah.
He's blocking it.
Go find Kira and Scott.
Go!
(SNARLING)
How much did they pay you?
Way more than you're worth. (GRUNTING)
(GUNSHOTS)
Scott?
Kira?
Stiles:
Oh.
Are you okay?
It's Scott.
Stiles, it's Scott.
- What?
- The Berserker.
It's him.
- Kate did it.
- What are you talking about?
She made him into one of them.
I don't know how, but it's him.
If they don't know it, they could kill him.
That's why Lydia's not here.
They won't know they're killing Scott.
(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTING)
(SOFTLY) Derek?
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)
Derek?
Derek.
- Are you serious?
- Very.
A baseball bat?
Against that guy?
Or thing or whatever it is.
My friends are in trouble.
And so is Liam, your best friend.
They need me.
I'm going for it.
And yes, with a baseball bat.
Argh!
(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTING)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
I thought you said it wanted to keep us here, not hurt us.
I think it changed its mind.
Stilinski:
Excuse me.
Catch.
(GASPS)
(MASON AND LYDIA COUGHING)
Stilinski:
You both okay?
It was after me.
It wanted me to stay in Beacon Hills.
I think this was all some sort of distraction.
Because you knew they're trying to kill someone.
Kill who?
Scott.
Take him.
Aim for the skull!
Peter:
Kill it.
Kill it now!
No, wait, wait.
Malia, wait!
It's Scott.
It's Scott.
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
Scott?
Scott, don't!
Scott, it's me.
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
Scott.
- (GROWLS) - (GUN FIRING)
They're not going down!
Nothing's getting through that armor and I'm running out of ammo.
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
Liam:
Scott, Scott, listen, listen, listen!
You're not a monster!
(LIAM BREATHING HEAVILY)
You're a werewolf!
Like me.
(SCREAMS)
You.
The only one who knew as much as Argent about Berserkers.
About the Nagual.
You taught Kate.
You helped her.
All for power.
For my family's power.
To be rightfully inherited by me.
Not usurped by some idiot teenage boy, so incorruptible, he won't shed the blood of his enemies even when justified.
You don't deserve your power.
Not power like this.
(ROARS)
(GRUNTS)
Oh, sorry, sweetheart, we'll talk about this later.
Scott:
Kira!
You were my Beta first, Scott.
It was my bite that changed your life.
And my bite that can end it.
Then, end it, Peter.
Because you won't get another chance.
(GROWLING)
(YELLS)
(ROARING)
(COCKS GUN)
(GRUNTS)
You're next, Araya.
I'm coming to kill you next.
Come, La Loba.
Let me show you how the Calaveras die.
(ROARS)
(WOLF HOWLING)
(SCREAMING)
You were...
You were dead.
No.
I was evolving.
Something you'll never do.
(BERSERKER SNARLING)
(GRUNTING)
(BREATHLESS) Chris?
(GRUNTING)
(YELLS)
Peter:
Come on, Scott.
Come on!
Pathetic.
(GRUNTS)
Fight like an Alpha, Scott.
(GROANING)
(GRUNTING)
Peter:
You want to defeat me?
You're going to have to kill me!
(ROARS)
(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTS)
You were never an Alpha, Peter.
But you were always a monster.
(GROANS)
(GUNSHOTS)
(KATE GRUNTS)
(GUNSHOTS)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
You want to kill me, Chris?
No.
But I don't want to save you anymore either.
I don't know that you're worth saving.
Just like when we were kids.
Always trying to make me the bad guy.
You can't see them clearly anymore, can you?
Scott's not your little hero.
None of 'em are.
Not when they killed Allison.
Allison died.
She died saving her friends.
Who would you die for?
Hmm?
You're not gonna kill me.
And you're not gonna catch me. (PANTING)
Not you. (GROANS)
Not Peter.
And not the Calaveras.
(GRUNTS)
(BREATHING RAGGEDLY)
Chris:
There's enough yellow wolfsbane to keep Peter out for the trip back.
But be careful.
You're really going with them?
Chris:
I made a deal with the Calaveras weeks ago.
They'll leave you alone.
All of you.
But only if I help them catch Kate.
What if you can't?
I'll find her.
Someone has to.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
So you're not really a U.S. Marshal, are you?
I was.
But I spent too long looking for one person.
It's hard to keep a job when part of it becomes an obsession.
Who were you after?
All I know is a code name.
The Desert Wolf.
Dad, you smell terrible.
Stilinski:
Yup.
You do too.
(SOFTLY) Come here.
I'm just so glad you're both safe.
Hey, what do you say we get outta here, get something to eat?
- Great.
I'm starving.
- Okay.
Yo, Daddy?
- What's your favorite food?
- Uh, pizza.
- Hey.
- (METAL CLANGING)
Dad?
Bring me back a slice?
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
The shard of obsidian that you brought back, Kira.
There's a reason you kept it.
And a reason your father took the liberty of making an alteration to it.
Do you know what it is?
A tail.
Your first.
Then Stiles said that Scott and Kira were stuck in Mexico which was why they missed the game.
Uh, so we went down to Mexico to drive them back from Mexico and that's why we all missed practice.
'Cause...
We were all in Mexico.
You took Kira on a date to Mexico?
It was our first real date.
In Mexico?
They wanted to do something special.
Okay.
I believe you.
- Really?
- Absolutely not.
But I've had experiences south of the border that would knock the genitals off you boys.
Still, let me be clear to you two.
This kid's the best talent I've seen in years.
So he's your responsibility now.
You boys are gonna stick together.
You're gonna look out for each other.
And you're gonna have each other's backs.
You got it?
We got it.
This used to be on a hard drive.
But we eventually decided it might be a good idea to have a hard copy around.
So we put it in a book.
What is it?
It's called the Bestiary.
Whatever you are, it might be in here.
I'd like to help you figure it out.
You actually think this is gonna hold me?
You think you can shoot me up with wolfsbane, make me docile and weak, and I won't find a way out?
DR. Valack:
It's not just the wolfsbane.
It's the mountain ash wood framework of the cells.
It's all around us.
Who the hell are you?
I could tell you.
But it's easier if I just... show you.
(SCREAMS)
(PRISONERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
LYDIA:
Previously, on Teen Wolf...
SCOTT:
It's a dead pool.
A hit list of supernatural creatures.
Why would someone use all this money just to kill us?
I know exactly who The Benefactor is.
Meredith.
It was your idea.
I will take out all of them!
Is it over?
I'm not a murderer.
STILES:
But you are a predator.
DEREK:
My strength, the healing.
All of it.
SCOTT:
Gone?
Whatever Kate did to me, it's still happening.
(SCREAMS)
STILES:
Banshees predict death.
You wanna bail on the plan.
Not when I'm this close to killing Scott McCall.
(GROWLING)
We're all going to church!
SCOTT:
Mexico.
- Scott!
CHRIS:
You ever heard of the Berserkers?
DEREK:
They wore the skins of bears to channel their ferocity.
No, Kate.
Don't.
(SCREAMING)
(GASPS)
Scott?
(BREATHING RAGGEDLY)
Scott?
(LOW GROWL)
(GROWLS) (SCREAMS)
(KIRA GRUNTING)
(GROWLING)
I'm going to have to do a better job of covering that up.
What did you do to him?
How.
That's...
That's the better story.
You see, when I first got away from the Calaveras,
I had no idea where to go.
But something kept pulling me here, to the temple of Tezcatlipoca.
His name means "smoking mirror"
and this place is a temple of the smoking mirror.
Obsidian.
When I got here, I found the Berserkers waiting for me.
They helped me survive.
I didn't know quite why until just recently.
(SCOFFS)
Until I decided to trust someone
I never thought I'd trust.
It was then that I found out
I could not only control the Berserkers, but I could create them.
They call me La Loba.
"The Bone Woman."
We let you out because I needed to test his loyalty.
Did you know that Scott became an Alpha without having to kill anyone?
He's been through quite a lot without ever having to kill.
I think it's time to change that.
(GASPING) No, Scott.
No, Scott, no.
(GASPS)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
You're not going to Mexico.
Dad, Scott and Kira have been kidnapped and taken to Mexico.
Okay?
I think that's a pretty good reason for a trip to Mexico.
(INHALES) Okay.
Even if Deaton is right about this...
Yeah.
The best thing to do is to go through the proper channels.
Dad...
That means calling the right law enforcement agencies, border patrol, putting out an all-points.
Dad, I can't just wait around for the wheels of bureaucracy to start spinning in five different government offices.
Okay?
Someone needs to go down there right now, find them and rescue them.
I'm going.
I can keep you from going.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
I'd find a way.
I can throw you in a cell.
I'd still find a way.
(SIGHS) Stiles, please.
Just give me a little more time to verify something slightly more concrete than a psychic vision by some guy with a third eye!
Look, I will call every law enforcement agency all the way down to South America if I have to.
If nothing turns up, then I'll book two flights to Mexico.
We'll both go.
Okay?
Okay, okay, great.
Do I get a gun?
No.
(SIGHS) I still don't like relying on these things.
I get it.
You miss your power.
I would, too.
It's not about power, it's about being able to help.
I don't like feeling helpless.
I'm human.
Do I look helpless?
You're a much better shot than me.
Do you really think you won't be coming back?
Not alive.
You know I'm not okay with that.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(SIGHS)
I am.
If it saves Scott and Kira.
But to be honest, I don't even know if this is enough firepower to take down one Berserker.
PETER:
Not even close.
(TITTERS)
Killing a Berserker is next to impossible.
It's not just the firepower, it's breaking the animal spirit from the human.
Well, the one person we know with that kind of experience is Argent.
And he's not getting back to me.
Well, then you're going to need help.
Like Malia, maybe Liam.
Definitely me.
Here, try that.
Fabric softener.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Remember, Scott's life is on the line.
(SNIFFS)
Yeah.
That works, too.
Oh!
Liam, go home.
You're not coming with us.
Why not?
Because it's a full moon.
And I don't feel like driving all the way down to Mexico just to have you rip my throat out.
You can lock me up, right?
Chain me down to the back seat or something?
You tore through the last chains, remember?
Yeah, we would have to freeze you in carbonite to get you down there.
Okay, then where do we get carbonite?
Seriously, you haven't seen it either?
Wait!
What if we put me in the trunk?
You'd get out of that, too.
Liam, you've been a werewolf all of five minutes.
You don't have to do this.
I know I don't, but I want to.
There's gotta be bigger chains, a bigger trunk or something.
There has to be.
Maybe there is.
STILES:
How did you get a prison transport van?
I'm a U.S. Marshal.
Yeah, I just thought that was just a cover.
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)
Are we really bringing him?
Are we really bringing him?
We're bringing everyone that we can.
And considering Scott and Kira were taken the night before a full moon, we should probably get going.
What's that mean?
If Kate took Scott back to the same temple that she took Derek, how do we know she's not planning to do the same thing to him?
What, she wants to make him younger?
Or take him back to when he wasn't a werewolf.
PETER:
A werewolf can't steal a true Alpha's power.
But maybe a Nagual jaguar, with the power of Tezcatlipoca behind her...
Maybe she can.
So, if everyone is sufficiently freaked out,
I say we get going.
STILES:
We can't.
Not without Lydia.
(SNIFFS)
I hope this works.
(LOW GROWL)
DEREK:
What's she doing at the school anyway?
We got Kira's sword, but we need something with a stronger scent.
Lydia went to get a jacket out of her locker.
Nothing.
If she has a car, she can catch up to us.
That's a good point.
We'll call her from the road.
No.
What if something happened?
What if she's in trouble?
Fine.
You stay, you find her.
We're gonna go on without you.
LIAM:
I could call Mason.
He has a study group at school.
Maybe he could look for her.
(SIGHS) All right.
Fine.
I need to be back there with Derek and Liam.
I've got some experience dealing with out-of-control teen wolves.
You'll be okay riding with Peter?
He is my father.
Maybe we could do some bonding.
No.
No bonding.
Play the radio, play it loud.
PETER:
Remember what we're dealing with.
It's not just Kate, it's Berserkers.
You might see human eyes behind those skulls.
Do not assume that there's any humanity left.
Oh.
This little one is terrified of them, aren't you?
Don't worry, my friend.
It is that fear that will keep you alive.
A reminder to everyone.
You do not fight Berserkers to survive, you fight to kill.
(LOW GROWL)
Yeah, her car's here.
You want me to look around the school and see if I can find her?
LIAM:
Yeah, definitely.
Call me as soon as you find her.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
All good?
Okay.
I brought something to help you.
This has been with my family for centuries.
It's a very powerful, supernatural talisman.
We use it to teach Betas how to control themselves on a full moon.
Yes, it's powerful.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Very powerful.
Lydia?
No wonder she's not answering.
What the hell?
(GROWLS)
(MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY ON RADIO)
Do you mind if I turn the radio down?
(LOWERS VOLUME)
You worried about Stiles?
I'm worried about everyone.
Do I need to be worried about you?
We have to go through the Berserkers to get to Kate.
Then we have to go through Kate to get to Scott and Kira.
Trust me, it's going to get messy.
Scott says we don't kill people.
You think
Scott would kill to save Kira?
Would you?
Kill to save Stiles?
What is it?
The full moon.
(SIGHS)
Good.
You'll need that power.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(GRUNTING) Whatever you were gonna teach me... (BREATHING HEAVILY)
I think you better start.
(GROANING)
NOSHIKO:
It's all right to cry.
It's no measure of your strength.
But I'm not strong.
I need to get up.
I need to tell them...
How do you know you can't?
Because I'm not healing.
You told me why I never get sick.
And you said I'd learn to heal.
Then learn.
I can't.
I don't know how...
How to start.
Or what to do...
I told you once that foxes and wolves tend not to get along.
But they are similar creatures, aren't they?
You've seen wolves heal.
How do they do it?
Kira, how do they trigger it?
Pain.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
With pain.
(GROANING)
(GROANING)
Are you okay?
My head...
Oh.
Yeah, it's probably gonna hurt a lot.
There was this guy.
Huge, really huge.
He had a, a skull on his face.
Yeah.
I know.
I saw it, too.
My phone's gone.
Yeah.
I think that's the point.
Okay.
Well, why, what's he gonna do to us?
I don't know.
But it definitely doesn't want us to leave.
Lydia, why do you keep saying "it"?
(CREATURE GROWLS)
(GASPING)
What is that thing?
Not human.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Liam, you with me?
We have a mantra that we use.
You repeat it, you focus on the words.
It's like meditating.
You say the words until you feel control coming back to you.
Okay.
Okay, okay!
What are the words?
Okay, look at the triskelion.
See the symbol?
I have a tattoo on my back, it's the same thing.
Each spiral means something.
Alpha, Beta, Omega.
It represents the idea that we can always rise to one and fall back to another.
Betas can become Alphas.
Alphas can become Betas.
Can Alphas become Omegas?
All you have to do is say the three words.
And with each one, you tell yourself you're getting calmer, more in control.
Go ahead.
Alpha, Beta...
Slower.
Alpha...
Beta...
Omega... (GROANING) Alpha...
Beta...
Omega...
Good.
Say it again.
Remember, every time you say the words, you're getting calmer.
Alpha, Beta...
Omega.
Say it again.
Derek, I don't think the powerful talisman of self-control is working.
(GRUNTING)
Liam, say it again!
(ROARING)
Liam!
(LIAM ROARING)
(GROANING)
Derek?
I think we're gonna need to go a little faster.
Keep going!
(ROARS)
(GRUNTS)
DEREK:
Liam!
Liam...
We're almost there.
You're trying to stay in control?
Trying to stay human.
That's exactly your problem.
Scott has you thinking that control and humanity are the same for us.
Now, let me give you some fatherly advice.
If you're gonna face something as animal as a Berserker and try to win, you need to focus on the animal inside you.
You'll need every ounce of ferocity and savagery you can muster.
You'll need it all.
(GROANING) Keep focus!
Derek, I don't think Alpha, Beta, Omega is resonating with him.
You know any other mantras?
(LIAM GROANING)
Yeah.
I do.
Liam, Liam.
What three things cannot long be hidden?
(GROANING) Liam!
Liam, look at me.
What three things cannot long be hidden?
STILES:
What three things?
(LIAM GRUNTS)
(PANTING) Sun...
The moon...
The truth.
That's it.
Say it again.
(LIAM GRUNTING)
Sun, the moon...
The truth.
Derek?
We're okay.
Sun...
Moon...
And the truth.
I can't believe I did it.
(SCOFFS)
For a minute there, I thought I was gonna tear the two of you apart.
Yeah.
That would've made for an awkward ride home.
So, thanks.
Think you can bring the same level of control and strength inside La Iglesia?
All right.
We might actually be able to do this.
(GRUNTING)
(GROWLING)
(GUNSHOTS)
(GRUNTING)
How bad is it?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Just get to Scott.
Just find him.
We'll be right behind you.
Go.
Go!
Hey, hey, save him.
(GRUNTING)
(GROANING)
Lydia was right.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
Okay, everyone stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
We gotta figure out where we are, then we gotta figure out how to find Scott and Kira.
How do I even have service...
Hi, Dad.
Okay, Dad, I know you're angry.
STILINSKI:
Oh, I'm beyond angry.
I've reached a level of fury that you could not possibly comprehend.
Okay, well, when I get back, you can ground me.
Ground you?
Ground you?
I'm going to hobble you!
Now, please, tell me you're all right.
Tell me that you're safe.
You want me to lie?
Oh, God.
Okay.
Tell me, tell me what I can do.
How can I help?
She was at the school when we called Mason to look for her, but now we're not hearing back from either of them.
I don't know, Dad, I don't know what I'm doin'.
You know, I'm just...
I'm trying to save my friends.
Okay.
I'll find Lydia and Mason.
You get Scott and Kira.
You save your friends.
Dad, if it's one of the Berserkers at the school, you're gonna need firepower.
A lot.
What do we do now?
Duck.
(GRUNTS)
Get down.
Go back.
Get back!
Go!
Go, go, go, go!
Can you still pull a trigger?
Yeah.
All right.
Stay with me.
You're gonna be okay.
It's a mortal wound.
And right now I'm feeling pretty mortal.
(SIGHS) I'm not gonna let you die.
(GROWLING IN DISTANCE)
(SIGHS)
Eh, you might just have to concentrate on saving yourself.
(SIGHS)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(SOFTLY) I don't hear it.
Come on.
No, no.
There's only one way out on this side of the basement.
I know.
But if we don't get out of here, someone's going to die.
How do you know that?
I just do.
We have to at least see if he's blocking the exit.
(SIGHS)

Yeah.
He's blocking' it.
Go, go, go.
Go find Kira and Scott.

It's Scott.
Stiles, it's Scott.
What?
The Berserker.
It's him.
Kate did it.
What are you talking about?
She made him into one of them.
I don't know how, but it's him.
If they don't know it, they could kill him.
That's why Lydia's not here.
They won't know they're killing Scott.

I'm going for it.
And yes, with a baseball bat.

Kill who?

About the Nagual.
You taught Kate.
You helped her.
All for power.
For my family's power.
To be rightfully inherited by me.
Not usurped by some idiot teenage boy, so incorruptible, he won't shed the blood of his enemies even when justified.
You don't deserve your power.
Not power like this.

I know exactly who The Benefactor is.
Meredith.
It was your idea.
I will take out all of them!
Is it over?
I'm not a murderer.
But you are a predator.
My strength, the healing.
All of it.
Gone?
Whatever Kate did to me, it's still happening.
Banshees predict death.
You wanna bail on the plan.
Not when I'm this close to killing Scott McCall.
We're all going to church!
Mexico.
Scott!
You ever heard of the Berserkers?
They wore the skins of bears to channel their ferocity.
No, Kate.
Don't.
Scott?
I'm going to have to do a better job of covering that up.
What did you do to him?
How.
That's...
That's the better story.
You see, when I first got away from the Calaveras,
I had no idea where to go.
But something kept pulling me here, to the temple of Tezcatlipoca.
His name means "smoking mirror"
and this place is a temple of the smoking mirror.
Obsidian.
When I got here, I found the Berserkers waiting for me.
They helped me survive.
I didn't know quite why until just recently.
Until I decided to trust someone
I never thought I'd trust.
It was then that I found out
I could not only control the Berserkers, but I could create them.
They call me La Loba.
"The Bone Woman."
We let you out because I needed to test his loyalty.
Did you know that Scott became an Alpha without having to kill anyone?
He's been through quite a lot without ever having to kill.
I think it's time to change that.
No, Scott.
No, Scott, no.
You're not going to Mexico.
Dad, Scott and Kira have been kidnapped and taken to Mexico.
Okay?
I think that's a pretty good reason for a trip to Mexico.
Okay.
- Even if Deaton is right about this...
- Yeah.
The best thing to do is to go through the proper channels.
- Dad...
- That means calling the right law enforcement agencies, border patrol, putting out an all-points.
Dad, I can't just wait around for the wheels of bureaucracy to start spinning in five different government offices.
Okay?
Someone needs to go down there right now, find them and rescue them.
I'm going.
I can keep you from going.
I'd find a way.
I can throw you in a cell.
I'd still find a way.
Stiles, please.
Just give me a little more time to verify something slightly more concrete than a psychic vision by some guy with a third eye!
Look, I will call every law enforcement agency all the way down to South America if I have to.
If nothing turns up, then I'll book two flights to Mexico.
We'll both go.
Okay?
Okay, okay, great.
Do I get a gun?
No.
I still don't like relying on these things.
I get it.
You miss your power.
I would, too.
It's not about power, it's about being able to help.
I don't like feeling helpless.
I'm human.
Do I look helpless?
You're a much better shot than me.
Do you really think you won't be coming back?
Not alive.
You know I'm not okay with that.
I am.
If it saves Scott and Kira.
But to be honest, I don't even know if this is enough firepower to take down one Berserker.
Not even close.
Killing a Berserker is next to impossible.
It's not just the firepower, it's breaking the animal spirit from the human.
Well, the one person we know with that kind of experience is Argent.
And he's not getting back to me.
Well, then you're going to need help.
Like Malia, maybe Liam.
Definitely me.
Here, try that.
Fabric softener.
Remember, Scott's life is on the line.
Yeah.
That works, too.
Oh!
Liam, go home.
You're not coming with us.
Why not?
Because it's a full moon.
And I don't feel like driving all the way down to Mexico just to have you rip my throat out.
You can lock me up, right?
Chain me down to the back seat or something?
You tore through the last chains, remember?
Yeah, we would have to freeze you in carbonite to get you down there.
Okay, then where do we get carbonite?
Seriously, you haven't seen it either?
Wait!
What if we put me in the trunk?
You'd get out of that, too.
Liam, you've been a werewolf all of five minutes.
You don't have to do this.
I know I don't, but I want to.
There's gotta be bigger chains, a bigger trunk or something.
There has to be.
Maybe there is.
How did you get a prison transport van?
I'm a U.S. Marshal.
Yeah, I just thought that was just a cover.
Are we really bringing him?
Are we really bringing him?
We're bringing everyone that we can.
And considering Scott and Kira were taken the night before a full moon, we should probably get going.
What's that mean?
If Kate took Scott back to the same temple that she took Derek, how do we know she's not planning to do the same thing to him?
What, she wants to make him younger?
Or take him back to when he wasn't a werewolf.
A werewolf can't steal a true Alpha's power.
But maybe a Nagual jaguar, with the power of Tezcatlipoca behind her...
Maybe she can.
So, if everyone is sufficiently freaked out,
I say we get going.
We can't.
Not without Lydia.
I hope this works.
What's she doing at the school anyway?
We got Kira's sword, but we need something with a stronger scent.
Lydia went to get a jacket out of her locker.
Nothing.
If she has a car, she can catch up to us.
That's a good point.
We'll call her from the road.
No.
What if something happened?
What if she's in trouble?
Fine.
You stay, you find her.
We're gonna go on without you.
I could call Mason.
He has a study group at school.
Maybe he could look for her.
All right.
Fine.
I need to be back there with Derek and Liam.
I've got some experience dealing with out-of-control teen wolves.
You'll be okay riding with Peter?
He is my father.
Maybe we could do some bonding.
No.
No bonding.
Play the radio, play it loud.
Remember what we're dealing with.
It's not just Kate, it's Berserkers.
You might see human eyes behind those skulls.
Do not assume that there's any humanity left.
Oh.
This little one is terrified of them, aren't you?
Don't worry, my friend.
It is that fear that will keep you alive.
A reminder to everyone.
You do not fight Berserkers to survive, you fight to kill.
Yeah, her car's here.
You want me to look around the school and see if I can find her?
Yeah, definitely.
Call me as soon as you find her.
All good?
Okay.
I brought something to help you.
This has been with my family for centuries.
It's a very powerful, supernatural talisman.
We use it to teach Betas how to control themselves on a full moon.
Yes, it's powerful.
Very powerful.
Lydia?
No wonder she's not answering.
What the hell?
Do you mind if I turn the radio down?
You worried about Stiles?
I'm worried about everyone.
Do I need to be worried about you?
We have to go through the Berserkers to get to Kate.
Then we have to go through Kate to get to Scott and Kira.
Trust me, it's going to get messy.
Scott says we don't kill people.
You think
Scott would kill to save Kira?
Would you?
Kill to save Stiles?
What is it?
The full moon.
Good.
You'll need that power.
Whatever you were gonna teach me...
I think you better start.
It's all right to cry.
It's no measure of your strength.
But I'm not strong.
I need to get up.
I need to tell them...
How do you know you can't?
Because I'm not healing.
You told me why I never get sick.
And you said I'd learn to heal.
Then learn.
I can't.
I don't know how...
How to start.
Or what to do...
I told you once that foxes and wolves tend not to get along.
But they are similar creatures, aren't they?
You've seen wolves heal.
How do they do it?
Kira, how do they trigger it?
Pain.
With pain.
Are you okay?
My head...
Oh.
Yeah, it's probably gonna hurt a lot.
There was this guy.
Huge, really huge.
He had a, a skull on his face.
Yeah.
I know.
I saw it, too.
My phone's gone.
Yeah.
I think that's the point.
Okay.
Well, why, what's he gonna do to us?
I don't know.
But it definitely doesn't want us to leave.
Lydia, why do you keep saying "it"?
What is that thing?
Not human.
Liam, you with me?
We have a mantra that we use.
You repeat it, you focus on the words.
It's like meditating.
You say the words until you feel control coming back to you.
Okay.
Okay, okay!
What are the words?
Okay, look at the triskelion.
See the symbol?
I have a tattoo on my back, it's the same thing.
Each spiral means something.
Alpha, Beta, Omega.
It represents the idea that we can always rise to one and fall back to another.
Betas can become Alphas.
Alphas can become Betas.
Can Alphas become Omegas?
All you have to do is say the three words.
And with each one, you tell yourself you're getting calmer, more in control.
Go ahead.
Alpha, Beta...
Slower.
Alpha...
Beta...
Omega...
Alpha...
Beta...
Omega...
Good.
Say it again.
Remember, every time you say the words, you're getting calmer.
Alpha, Beta...
- Omega.
- Say it again.
Derek, I don't think the powerful talisman of self-control is working.
Liam, say it again!
Liam!
Derek?
I think we're gonna need to go a little faster.
Keep going!
Liam!
Liam...
We're almost there.
You're trying to stay in control?
Trying to stay human.
That's exactly your problem.
Scott has you thinking that control and humanity are the same for us.
Now, let me give you some fatherly advice.
If you're gonna face something as animal as a Berserker and try to win, you need to focus on the animal inside you.
You'll need every ounce of ferocity and savagery you can muster.
You'll need it.
Keep focus!
Derek, I don't think Alpha, Beta, Omega is resonating with him.
You know any other mantras?
Yeah.
I do.
Liam, Liam.
What three things cannot long be hidden?
Liam!
Liam, look at me.
What three things cannot long be hidden?
What three things?
Sun...
The moon...
The truth.
That's it.
Say it again.
Sun, the moon...
The truth.
Derek?
We're okay.
Sun...
Moon...
And the truth.
I can't believe I did it.
For a minute there, I thought I was gonna tear the two of you apart.
Yeah.
That would've made for an awkward ride home.
So, thanks.
Think you can bring the same level of control and strength inside La Iglesia?
All right.
We might actually be able to do this.
How bad is it?
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Just get to Scott.
Just find him.
We'll be right behind you.
Go.
Go!
Hey, hey, save him.
Lydia was right.
Okay, everyone stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
We gotta figure out where we are, then we gotta figure out how to find Scott and Kira.
How do I even have service...
Hi, Dad.
Okay, Dad, I know you're angry.
Oh, I'm beyond angry.
I've reached a level of fury that you could not possibly comprehend.
Okay, well, when I get back, you can ground me.
Ground you?
Ground you?
I'm going to hobble you!
Now, please, tell me you're all right.
Tell me that you're safe.
You want me to lie?
Oh, God.
Okay.
Tell me, tell me what I can do.
How can I help?
She was at the school when we called Mason to look for her, but now we're not hearing back from either of them.
I don't know, Dad, I don't know what I'm doin'.
You know, I'm just...
I'm trying to save my friends.
Okay.
I'll find Lydia and Mason.
You get Scott and Kira.
You save your friends.
Dad, if it's one of the Berserkers at the school, you're gonna need firepower.
A lot.
What do we do now?
Duck.
Go back.
Get back!
Go!
Go, go, go, go!
Can you still pull a trigger?
Yeah.
All right.
Stay with me.
You're gonna be okay.
It's a mortal wound.
And right now I'm feeling pretty mortal.
I'm not gonna let you die.
Eh, you might just have to concentrate on saving yourself.
I don't hear it.
- Come on.
- No, no.
There's only one way out on this side of the basement.
I know.
But if we don't get out of here, someone's going to die.
- How do you know that?
- I just do.
We have to at least see if he's blocking the exit.
Yeah.
He's blocking it.
Go find Kira and Scott.
Go!
How much did they pay you?
Way more than you're worth.
Scott?
Kira?
Oh.
Are you okay?
It's Scott.
Stiles, it's Scott.
- What?
- The Berserker.
It's him.
- Kate did it.
- What are you talking about?
She made him into one of them.
I don't know how, but it's him.
If they don't know it, they could kill him.
That's why Lydia's not here.
They won't know they're killing Scott.
Derek?
Derek?
Derek.
- Are you serious?
- Very.
A baseball bat?
Against that guy?
Or thing or whatever it is.
My friends are in trouble.
And so is Liam, your best friend.
They need me.
I'm going for it.
And yes, with a baseball bat.
Argh!
I thought you said it wanted to keep us here, not hurt us.
I think it changed its mind.
Excuse me.
Catch.
You both okay?
It was after me.
It wanted me to stay in Beacon Hills.
I think this was all some sort of distraction.
Because you knew they're trying to kill someone.
Kill who?
Scott.
Take him.
Aim for the skull!
Kill it.
Kill it now!
No, wait, wait.
Malia, wait!
It's Scott.
It's Scott.
Scott?
Scott, don't!
Scott, it's me.
Scott.
They're not going down!
Nothing's getting through that armor and I'm running out of ammo.
Scott, Scott, listen, listen, listen!
You're not a monster!
You're a werewolf!
Like me.
You.
The only one who knew as much as Argent about Berserkers.
About the Nagual.
You taught Kate.
You helped her.
All for power.
For my family's power.
To be rightfully inherited by me.
Not usurped by some idiot teenage boy, so incorruptible, he won't shed the blood of his enemies even when justified.
You don't deserve your power.
Not power like this.
Oh, sorry, sweetheart, we'll talk about this later.
Kira!
You were my Beta first, Scott.
It was my bite that changed your life.
And my bite that can end it.
Then, end it, Peter.
Because you won't get another chance.
You're next, Araya.
I'm coming to kill you next.
Come, La Loba.
Let me show you how the Calaveras die.
You were...
You were dead.
No.
I was evolving.
Something you'll never do.
Chris?
Come on, Scott.
Come on!
Pathetic.
Fight like an Alpha, Scott.
You want to defeat me?
You're going to have to kill me!
You were never an Alpha, Peter.
But you were always a monster.
You want to kill me, Chris?
No.
But I don't want to save you anymore either.
I don't know that you're worth saving.
Just like when we were kids.
Always trying to make me the bad guy.
You can't see them clearly anymore, can you?
Scott's not your little hero.
None of 'em are.
Not when they killed Allison.
Allison died.
She died saving her friends.
Who would you die for?
Hmm?
You're not gonna kill me.
And you're not gonna catch me.
Not you.
Not Peter.
And not the Calaveras.
There's enough yellow wolfsbane to keep Peter out for the trip back.
But be careful.
You're really going with them?
I made a deal with the Calaveras weeks ago.
They'll leave you alone.
All of you.
But only if I help them catch Kate.
What if you can't?
I'll find her.
Someone has to.
So you're not really a U.S. Marshal, are you?
I was.
But I spent too long looking for one person.
It's hard to keep a job when part of it becomes an obsession.
Who were you after?
All I know is a code name.
The Desert Wolf.
Dad, you smell terrible.
Yup.
You do too.
Come here.
I'm just so glad you're both safe.
Hey, what do you say we get outta here, get something to eat?
- Great.
I'm starving.
- Okay.
Yo, Daddy?
- What's your favorite food?
- Uh, pizza.
Hey.
Dad?
Bring me back a slice?
The shard of obsidian that you brought back, Kira.
There's a reason you kept it.
And a reason your father took the liberty of making an alteration to it.
Do you know what it is?
A tail.
Your first.
Then Stiles said that Scott and Kira were stuck in Mexico which was why they missed the game.
Uh, so we went down to Mexico to drive them back from Mexico and that's why we all missed practice.
'Cause...
We were all in Mexico.
You took Kira on a date to Mexico?
It was our first real date.
In Mexico?
They wanted to do something special.
Okay.
I believe you.
- Really?
- Absolutely not.
But I've had experiences south of the border that would knock the genitals off you boys.
Still, let me be clear to you two.
This kid's the best talent I've seen in years.
So he's your responsibility now.
You boys are gonna stick together.
You're gonna look out for each other.
And you're gonna have each other's backs.
You got it?
We got it.
This used to be on a hard drive.
But we eventually decided it might be a good idea to have a hard copy around.
So we put it in a book.
What is it?
It's called the Bestiary.
Whatever you are, it might be in here.
I'd like to help you figure it out.
You actually think this is gonna hold me?
You think you can shoot me up with wolfsbane, make me docile and weak, and I won't find a way out?
It's not just the wolfsbane.
It's the mountain ash wood framework of the cells.
It's all around us.
Who the hell are you?
I could tell you.
But it's easier if I just... show you.
I got it, why don't we rent a bouncy house for Christine's birthday party?
She'll love that.
Kids love to bounce up and down.
A recent study showed that over the past 10 years, approximately 65,000 children were treated for injuries received on bouncy houses.
Listen, you've already put the kibosh on the kickball party, the glow-stick party and the reptile guy.
Who doesn't like reptiles?
I don't see why she needs a party.
Kids just get cake all over themselves and fight over toy[.
They're little kids;
what could be better?
I mean, don't you remember your birthday party when you were a little girl?
I never had one.
What?
!
Wait a second, you-you never had a birthday party?
That is correct and I didn't miss anything.
Okay.
Christine is dressed.
I'll drop her off at preschool on my way to the market.
Thanks, Dad.
Uh, no party, huh?
What?
Booth thinks I was deprived, because you never gave me any birthday parties as a child.
Well, you didn't have birthday parties, because that would draw attention to us and with the police looking for us, that's not a good thing.
Right.
Unbelievable.
I forgot-- fugitive.
Listen, if I had it to do over again, you would have birthday parties, but I ca-- I-I can't turn the clock back.
He's right, Booth;
the arrow of time--
Brennan.
Oh, okay.
It's coming into the lab?
Dot touch it until I get there.
Dad's taking my car.
I need a ride to the lab.
Remains are coming in.
Sure.
I got you.
No party, huh?
W-W-What do you want me to do?
Make a balloon animal for her now?
A book?
!
Yeah. 364 pages.
I never thought I could do it.
And it's a mystery?
Yeah.
Like Dr. B writes?
Yeah.
Same genre.
You know, write what you know.
Wow.
Oh...
The victim is in there?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, that, is awesome.
Wow, it's like the root system is pulling apart the bones.
And there's very little tissue remaining, but there should be enough for a tox screen.
I thought Dr. Brennan said not to touch it.
But... since you're the boss, it doesn't really matter what she wants.
Kudzu.
Hey, man, this stuff grows about a foot a day, so I should be able to tell how long the victim's been in here.
There's staining
- and pitting on the bones.
- Yeah.
Kudzu excretes isoflavone aglycones to break down the surface of the bone so the roots can attach.
Hmm.
What was that?
It's still growing.
It's feeding off the remaining tissue.
I've seen this movie.
It doesn't end well for humanity.
Look, you shouldn't be upset with Max is Dr. Brennan isn't...
Oh, God.
It's encased.
It's like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
Yeah.
The squints are going to have a field day with that.
But when you're a little girl, you should be treated like a princess, not some criminal on the run.
Max was a criminal on the run, so Dr. Brennan's probably just sublimated those feelings as a way to cope.
And now she's just trying to justify it all by saying that a kid's birthday party isn't important.
But it is.
I would imagine so.
I've never been thrown a party either, so...
You too?
No.
Wow.
Yeah.
My dad was a drunk, and he threw me a birthday party every year.
The only time I ever saw him really sober.
It's probably why birthdays are so meaningful to you.
Tell you what, why don't you just, you know, shrink the photos.
Just focus on what you do best and I'll get the techs to go out to the crime scene and see if they can find any, uh, tire tracks and footprints.
When we get time of death, we might be able to match them up.
Okay.
Okay, this plant is covering too much of the skull for me to do a reconstruction.
Are you going to be able to remove the vegetation without compromising the remains, Dr. Hodgins?
Sort of my thing.
The size of the second cervical vertebra indicates the victim was male.
Animal predation appears to account for most of the tissue loss.
Yeah, the kudzu fed on the rest.
Guys, I, I don't even see the skull.
He's peeking through here, like an apparition appearing through a leafy fog.
I beg your pardon, Dr. Edison?
Clark just finished writing a book.
It's a mystery, so you better watch out, Dr. B.
Why?
I doubt it will impact my sales.
Good for you, Clark.
I wouldn't have thought of you as a writer.
Well, after Nora and I broke up, I had a lot of free time.
I found, in the evenings, the words just poured out, so...
Your time is not free now, Dr. Edison.
Why are you even here, rather than an intern?
Forensic conference in Buffalo.
The interns got extra credit if they went.
Yeah, well, everyone should get extra credit for going to Buffalo.
Okay, then.
Which I will interpret as, "Welcome aboard."
Thank you.
The angular eye orbit indicates the victim is Caucasian.
The root system seems to have snaked its way through every opening.
We need to remove the skull before it's damaged.
No problem.
Severing the roots around the orifices loosens the kudzu's hold.
See that?
Delicate work.
Yeah.
Very.
Hey, so are you going to do Christine's birthday party at the house, Dr. B?
Please concentrate, Dr. Hodgins.
Ye of little faith.
The skull is free.
Oh!
That is why I put no stock in faith!

The root system has crushed the bones, Dr. Hodgins.
Yeah, and it is still growing.
Well, it might stop, if we can get out the remaining tissue and organs that it's feeding on.
I'm cutting as fast as I can, but the backseat driving isn't helping.
Dr. Edison is going to have a very difficult time reassembling the remains.
I've already asked for help from my department.
Here you go.
Ah, a portion of the liver.
The kudzu seemed to love it.
The roots have grown through the endosteum.
I don't even know what this is.
His prostate.
And it's still relatively intact.
It is always the last organ to go.
Does that mean that you can determine time of death?
Well, if the body's been outside since death, decomp would indicate at least six days.
Well, given the rate of growth of the kudzu, I'd say nine.
Eight?
Yeah.
Deal.
I'm gonna run this tissue for DNA and run a tox screen.
According to these pictures, looks like he pulled right up the embankment, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, and look, there are no footprints between where the car pulled up and where the body was found.
So, what-what, he got out of his car, right?
His feet didn't leave the asphalt, probably because he was afraid he was gonna be seen and he dumps the body as quickly as possible.
We're dealing with an amateur here.
He would have picked a more secluded spot.
Chances are, the killer was horrified by what he did.
Yeah.
Mm.
So you gonna... you gonna let Dr. Brennan help plan the party?
I will.
It would make her feel like a princess if she did.
Right.
That didn't go over well.
Here are a few more clean bones for you.
Oh, thank you.
These clean bones are really making reconstruction a lot easier.
So far, I know that the victim suffered sharp force trauma to the parietal;
the cross-shaped fractures indicative of someone that was struck from the left with a hard-shaped object.
So, a fight with a lefty before he was killed?
Yeah.
Looks that way.
You know, this might end up being a very exciting case.
Perhaps it was about love, or money, or love and money, or--
Easy does it there, Mr. Dickens.
Sure.
You know, I would love for you to read what I just finished.
I mean, I've already submitted to a publisher, but of course, I can make changes.
Yeah.
Sure.
DNA said the victim is Joe Starkel.
So the victim's brother works for Merryvale Productions-- they make TV shows.
Apparently, the victim used to work there too.
What about a storyteller for the children?
I have the number of an excellent one to call.
That sounds promising.
I know!
Yeah.
He tells environmental tales about species who are dying on the Great Barrier Reef.
What?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
That sounds awful.
It's educational and poignant.
What's awful about that?
The words
"educational" and "poignant."
Just leave it to me, Bones.
I'm going for fun and more fun.
A lot of fun.
Trust me.
Mr. Starkel and the other performers are about to start shooting a scene.
He's the actor in green.

Kids love this kind of stuff.
Don't you realize who they are?
These are the Veggie-Ta-Bills.
Christine loves these guys.
Loves the show.
She does?
What, do you really think that she's eating broccoli 'cause you told her there's a pint of fiber in it?
3.8 grams, as well as 20 percent of her vitamin A requirements.
Not to mention, an abundance of--
These are the Veg-Ta-Bills.
They're vegetables that are all named "Bill."
Corn is a fruit, not a vegetable.
That's not true, that's not true.
Sometimes considered a grain, but technically...
Okay, but that's not true.

We have to work on a new dance for that last part.
We can do better.
That was great.
It was great, great.
Carrots, corn and broccoli-- my man.
Who are you?
We're with the FBI.
Show him your badge.
Bones, wait till we...
We're here to inform you that your brother has been murdered.
And that corn is not a vegetable.
Oh, my God.
I'm just talking...
I can't believe Joe is dead.
Do you know how it happened?
We don't know all the details yet.
He was discovered being devoured by a patch of kudzu along the side of State Route 32.
Really?
What?
You don't follow the...?
Oh, God!
This is awful.
Can you think of anyone who'd want to hurt your brother?
No.
He was a wonderful guy.
He was the best man at our wedding.
Wait a second-- if your brother was Carrot Bill, who-who's that?
That's Tommy.
When Joe left, we had to find a replacement.
If Joe created the show, why did he leave?
He was working on developing a new show--
Mirthquake Village.
So you weren't upset that your brother left?
Sure-Sure, I was, at first.
They're brothers.
Brothers fight, right?
When was the last time either one of you saw him?
It's been a couple months.
He's pretty busy with his new show.
Look, we may have some more questions for you.
If you're thinking about leaving town,
I suggest you call that number first-- that's me.
Okay.
You have something for me, Dr. Edison?
Yes.
I would like you to read my book.
Dr. Hodgins is, and I would, uh, like to give you the chance as well.
You know what?
I am very busy.
Wouldn't Dr. Brennan be a better judge of your work?
I mean, she's a writer, too.
Mm, I'd rather get feedback from readers.
After all, that's who I wrote it for.
We should probably finish the case first, and then I'll try to get to it.
Great.
Now speaking of which,
I found remodeled fractures on the radius and ulna of both arms as well as the right fifth and eighth ribs.
Remodeling suggests that it was sustained about eight weeks ago.
A fight?
Yes.
His brother said everybody loved Joe.
I guess that wasn't the case.
Anything on cause of death yet?
No, not yet.
Okay.
Dr. Saroyan... you... forgot my book.
I look forward to your thoughts.
Of course.
Okay, check this out.
I found the perfect thing for Christine's birthday party.
Ronnie the One-Man Band?
Yes!
The one-man band!
Show me one person that doesn't like a one-man band.
I'm sure many don't like them, which is why they're such a rarity.
Help me out here, Sweets.
You like the one-man band?
I think this is really between the two of you.
Come on.
You know how hard Christine laughs when she watches Mary Poppins and Dick Van Dyke, you know, doing the one-man band.
That is true.
True.
Oh, you got a text here from Cam.
"Joe Starkel was in a serious fight about eight weeks ago."
That's when he was doing his new show.
Maybe someone on that show knows who fought with him.
Hold on a minute.
You're saying
Joe Starkel is dead?
Well, he got into a fight a few months ago, when he was working here.
Do you know anything about that?
No.
Uh, he was pretty irritable, though, because Mirthquake Village didn't turn out to be very good.
Look, I told Joe, real nice,
I was pulling the plug.
It's tough for a one-hit wonder to accept the truth, you know what I mean?
Jake, we need to talk.
I'm a little busy.
These nice people are with the FBI.
It'll just be a minute.
My character would never wear a crocodile belt.
Why the hell not?
You're a crocodile cowboy.
It's sick, a croc wearing croc.
Would you wear a human belt?
I agree with the crocodile.
Okay, Bones, that's enough.
Listen, you wouldn't happen to know a Joe Starkel?
Oh.
Oh, is that what this is about?
Yeah.
Is he finally filing charges, Jake?
Wear whatever the hell you want.
Just let me finish up here.
I'm sorry.
Charges?
What charges?
I don't know what he's babbling about.
Well, it's no great secret, Jake.
Jake here and Joe, they got into it when Jake pulled the plug on Mirthquake.
Really?
- A little tiff.
- His injuries were extensive.
You fractured his ribs, mandible, zygomatic.
Funny how that slipped your mind.
Joe started it.
He freaked when
I told him I didn't want to do his show.
He came at me swinging.
I defended myself.
I was standing my ground.
So, how's it coming?
Actually, the detergent I used to loosen the vines from the bones cleaned off a ton of very interesting stuff.
And what did you find?
Well, so far, I found some motor oil that was on the victim.
And I'll try to match that to a specific car.
I also found a mixture of limestone, clay, fly ash, and gypsum.
Oh, uh, Portland cement.
It's my job to determine that, but you are absolutely right.
And I'm thoroughly impressed.
So what does it mean?
I'm not sure yet.
Could be a construction site.
But I believe the answer is in the runoff.
Have you, uh, started the book yet?
No.
I am so nervous.
I mean, what if it stinks?
But it could be great, right?
MONTENEGRO I just found out that the producer Starkel fought with was out of the country when he was killed.
But I think that I have a new suspect.
So, this is Carrot Bill's Twitter account.
You mean Joe Starkel.
No.
This is the carrot's.
You'd be surprised about how many adult fans there are of the show.
Like this woman, Debra Ann Volker.
Her Twitter handle is SuperVeggieFanXOXO.
Carrot Bill was blocking her direct messages.
"I rely on you to guide my life.
"I trust in you.
Everything I am is because of you."
Okay, this is a woman that's showing signs of being obsessed.
Well, that's just the beginning.
Flash forward to just after Starkel left the Veg-Ta-Bills.
"I gave you everything.
You let me down.
"You will rot in hell, and I will make it happen." Wow.
She sent over 50 tweets in a 48-hour period, and this was the week before Starkel was killed.
Look at this picture she posted.
What, she Photoshopped herself into that?
It's crazy, right?
Uh, a grown woman obsessed with a giant orange phallic symbol?
Yeah, I'm comfortable calling her crazy.
Carrot Bill dead?
I can't believe it.
He was the best vegetable.
Okay, you do realize that Carrot Bill is a fictional character?
Joe Starkel is the man that died.
I know.
I'm not insane, Dr. Sweets.
Shrinks always look for the crazy in everything.
I watch the Veg-Ta-Bills with my six-year-old son.
To him, the carrot is real.
Right.
Did you send these to Joe Starkel?
I'm kind of a Twitter freak, I guess.
That's a bit of an understatement.
Uh, "I want to peel you out of your carrot suit and eat you raw." Okay, okay, my son wasn't the only one who liked the show.
But you know what happens online.
You're anonymous, so you say things that you wouldn't face-to-face, right?
There are hundreds of these messages.
I mean, it starts with autograph requests and it moves on to wanting to meet, and then the stuff about eating his carrot.
I mean, that's-that's, cyberstalking, Ms. Volker.
Maybe I went a little overboard, but that show changed my life as much as my son's.
I was overweight, eating junk,
I had high blood pressure, and-and sleep apnea... but because of Carrot Bill,
I went from this, to what you see now.
He saved my life and my career.
I sell beauty products, which is very hard to do when you're 80 pounds overweight.
That is quite a change.
Well, I was terrified of putting this weight back on when he left the show.
So you saw the group as kind of a talisman for your good fortune then.
I've always been a little superstitious, I guess.
Have you always threatened people?
Why would I kill him?
Why?
He changed my life.
How are you doing with Joe Starkel's e-mails?
He deleted most of them using a multi-pass system used by the DoD.
Sounds like he was hiding something.
I guess we'll never know.
Well, maybe not.
I might be able to use a magnetic force microscopy to recover film fragments and piece them together.
Did you get anything else from the tox screens?
Nope.
He was one clean-living carrot.
Clark's book?
I only got through two chapters.
Pretty painful stuff.
Two pages of the sun setting over the remains of an itinerant stock broker.
So I found traces of asphalt with the concrete and oil.
I think the injuries might have taken place in a parking lot.
Oh, great.
So that narrows down the murder site
- to, like, a million places.
- Wow.
Snarky.
Oh, the book got you down?
Ooh...
"Death had never looked so dead as the death
"now in front of them,
"all life drained, only death covering the dead."
You think the victim was dead?
Please, I couldn't even get past chapter one.
Remember this?
"McDonald's farm was nestled in a glen, perfect for the final days of an old man."
Old McDonald had a farm?
Really?
Seriously?
What are we gonna tell him?
We're gonna tell him the truth.
That I've never read anything like it.
Oh, that's good.
Yeah.
It's, uh, one of a kind.
Absolutely.
What's one of a kind?
Oh, uh, your book.
I've never read anything like it.
Yeah, yeah.
You know, I've been very busy with the case, so I've only gotten through chapter one, but so far, it is just...
I mean...
Whew!
Well, you know, my feeling is, if the writer doesn't hook a reader in chapter one, he's not doing his job.
Look, I just don't want compliments.
I can take criticism.
Of-Of course.
Sure.
You-you got it.
Okay, great.
Now, um... oh.
I found some additional remodeled injuries, uh, this time to the sternum and lower ribs.
More recent than from the fight with the producer.
You know,
I hope we solve this soon so you can all finish reading.
Me, too.
Can't wait!
Chapter two awaits.
Right, right.
It's so nice to have coffee with you.
We never to do this.
I know.
But something tells me this is about more than coffee.
It's Christine's party.
Booth is taking care of it and that makes me uncomfortable, because I have no frame of reference for an important event in my daughter's life.
Oh, honey... it wasn't that bad.
I mean, your mother and I did all we could.
You could have lived an honest life, Dad.
You know, sometimes circumstances move your life in a direction you never thought it would go.
What are you implying?
Well, your mother and I, we never intended to live outside the law.
I don't understand.
Then why did you?
I can't tell you why.
Not yet.
Certain people are out there... still alive... could get hurt.
And after all I've done,
I don't want to hurt anyone else.
That's not a real answer.
I...
I know, but you're just going to have to trust me.
It's not easy, Dad.
I'm sure it isn't.
But when all is said and done, honey, your childhood wasn't so bad.
You used to love playing tag when you were a kid.
Think back.
Come on.
You loved it.
And you... and you always got me.
I mean, you could... you-you would fade to your right and then, suddenly, you would slash through to your left...
Y-You could've played football.
I can still hear you laughing and squealing with joy every time you got me.
Isn't that reference enough for you to... to give Christine a good birthday?
So what is the verdict?
Okay?
Is Debra Ann Volker capable of murder?
Well, she definitely suffers from celebrity worship syndrome.
Celebrity worship syndrome?
What is that?
Is that even a real thing?
Yeah.
It's an obsessive-addictive disorder.
I'll get you the literature on it, if you want.
Nah, I'll take your word for it.
So is she a killer?
Volker's tweets definitely place her at the borderline of pathological behavior.
And since there's no cause of death, we have nothing to link her, except that she's a wacko.
Well, wackos are kind of my thing.
Yeah, well, evidence is my thing, Sweets.
You know that.
Hold on.
Ooh!
It's Ronnie!
Who's Ronnie?
Hey!
Ronnie!
Yeah!
Who's Ronnie?
Thanks, bud, for getting back to me.
He's a one-man-band.
Oh...
Okay.
Now?
Great.
He's going to play a song for us.
Now?
Yeah, li...
Huh?
It's pretty cool.
Right?
This guy's a genius.
The fractures to the body of the sternum, the xiphoid process and the surrounding ribs appear to be related to chest compressions.
Which were sustained about five months ago.
Now, what's odd is that for someone who appears to have been assaulted at time of death, there are no Colles fractures to the distal radius, or humeral head breaks.
Which suggests the victim didn't try to break his fall.
Hmm.
Because he lost consciousness.
But none of the injuries he sustained would have be enough to render him unconscious.
Yeah, and Dr. Saroyan said his tox screens came back clear, so no drugs or alcohol.
Which means there's a cause we're not seeing.
And that calls for imagination.
Well, it's what we writers do, isn't it?
But scientists require facts, not flights of fancy.
True.
Of course.
Congratulations on finishing your novel, Clark.
I know what an achievement that is.
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.
Booth.
I reconstructed Joe Starkel's deleted e-mails.
Apparently, he wanted to be Carrot Bill again.
His brother never mentioned anything about that.
Well, these weren't to his brother.
They were to the head of the company that produced the Veg-Ta-Bills, Henry Munson.
"Munson"?
Whoa, wait a second.
The new Carrot Bill is Tommy Munson.
I know.
Tommy is Henry Munson's son.
Look, I didn't have any problems with Joe.
He was a great guy.
No?
No problems at all?
Okay, Daddy didn't tell you that Joe wanted his job back?
Yeah.
Sure he did.
What about it?
Okay, and that didn't make you upset, that you were probably going to be replaced?
That's what I thought at first.
But then Joe called me and told me he was coming up with a whole new character for me.
Wait a second-
- Joe called you, not his brother?
Yeah, he and his brother fought all the time.
They're both artist types.
He wanted to work it out with me first.
I was either going to be an asparagus or a Brussels sprout.
But I was pushing for the asparagus, so... so I wouldn't lose the phallic thing.
Right.
Got it.
Okay.
But the overall deal would be if Joe rejoins the group, you would be getting a pay cut.
Oh, I was never in it for the money.
Why, because your daddy's rich?
No.
Because of the moms.
I was in it for them.
The moms...?
Joe cleaned up for years.
A few moms would slip him their phone numbers after every show.
Then, when I got into the carrot suit, it worked for me, too.
That's why I wanted to be an asparagus.
Right.
Okay.
When was the last time you saw Joe?
A week ago Tuesday.
I was supposed to meet up with him after the show to talk through some concepts, but he never showed up.
Right, let me guess... uh, no one knew that you were going to meet Joe.
Well, yeah, of course.
Look-look, like I said,
Joe wanted this to be just between us until we worked out all the details.
So you don't have an alibi the day that Joe disappeared.
I didn't kill Joe.
Okay?
You...
you have to believe me.
I'm just trying to get the facts here, Mr. Carrot, and it's not looking too good for you.
We're ready!
We need the carrot!
Hey.
I found traces of castoreum, ambergris, musk... which is perfume.
I also found tartrazine and glycol distearate, which is found in lipstick.
Oh.
Well, that makes sense.
Apparently, he slept with a lot of women.
Listen, honey, um... we have a problem.
What?
Clark's book.
We have to be honest with him.
I mean, nobody is ever gonna publish it.
Well, it's not up to us, Angie.
We don't have a choice.
He asked to see us so that we could talk about the book.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
After we finish the case.
I don't suppose it's ethical to take a lot more time to catch a killer.
We're his friends.
I...
I just think we should be straight with him.
Man...
I hate it when you act like an adult.
What'd you find?
Dr. Brennan told me to take another look at the fractures on the body of the sternum.
Another fight?
No, these are three months before the fight.
I've heard of people hating their vegetables before, but this was one despised carrot.
These injuries weren't from a fight.
The fracturing to the ribs and sternum, these fractures run laterally, caused by repeated forceful compression of the rib cage.
CPR?
Almost certainly.
So he might have had a heart attack five months ago.
And if he still had a heart condition, it would explain him dropping without breaking his fall.
But it wouldn't explain why someone would dump him into a pile of kudzu.
Starkel was admitted to Mountview General two years ago, with a rare heart condition called Long QT Syndrome.
Sounds like a dude ranch.
It's a condition which increases the risk of episodes of torsades de pointes.
Wow.
What's that?
It's potentially fatal arrhythmia provoked by various stimuli.
Like what?
Anything that could startle you-- a loud noise or a sudden shock.
That's a hell of a way to go through life.
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.
Well, beta blockers are used to treat the condition quite effectively.
All right, then what killed him?
He wasn't taking his medication.
Cam's tox screen came back negative for all drugs, even the beta blockers.
Why would a guy with a deadly condition not take his medication?
Men have been known to stop taking beta blockers because of a strong...
side effect.
Oh.
Impotence.
Munson said that Starkel was sleeping around.
So obviously, I guess he decided that sex was more important than staying alive.
Someone could have known his condition and figured it was a perfect way to kill him.
Oh, wow, that is just cold.
Oh, oh, oh, I...
oh, I almost forgot.
I almost forgot.
I set up the whole, uh, one man band ready to go for Christine's birthday party.
He's going to kill it!
I was thinking, Booth...
Since we'll be in the park,
I thought we could play tag.
Sure.
Tag is fun.
See, you know how to have fun.
You're not gonna catch me, though.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.
I am quite good at tag.
Come on.
I used to be a Ranger, okay?
You're never gonna catch me.
We'll see.
Hey.
So I found duck poo, pig bristle and goat hairs in the kudzu run-off.
Why do you get to have all the fun?
The animal particles, as well as everything else we found, suggest that Starkel could have been killed in a parking lot near a farm.
But there are no farms close to where the body was dumped.
What are you up to?
Well, I decided to search
Starkel's credit card charges, to see if it's possible to track his movements on the day he died.
Nailed it, I'm sure.
Well, no.
He didn't charge anything that day.
But it did give me an idea.
I expanded the search to include all of Starkel's credit card activity over the past two months, right?
Then I cross-referenced those charges against the credit card activity of all of our suspects.
I have married Big Brother.
Interesting result.
Credit card and debit card purchases of the victim and of Marilyn Starkel intersect several times.
Look.
Joe Starkel rents a room at the Tidefront Motel.
And here
Marilyn buys gas the following morning, next-door.
Okay.
Here's another one.
A hotel stay on Joe's card.
And then a trip to the closest drug store by Marilyn that same night.
Now, these two don't live anywhere near each other.
So, Carrot Bill is having an affair with his brother's wife.
And his brother would definitely know about his heart condition.
We talked to your wife, okay?
She claims that you knew, okay?
That she was having an affair with your brother.
Marilyn and I are both artists, Agent Booth.
We believe in letting our creative side out to play.
"Letting your creative side out to play."
What does that have to do with anything?
She was following her feelings, which I support.
We have an open relationship.
You have an open relationship?
Really?
That's really convenient for you to say right now.
The fact is that you knew that your brother had a medical condition, so you thought you could scare him so you can get away with murder.
I couldn't do that even if I wanted to.
Joe was on medication.
He had it under control.
You're saying you didn't know that your brother stopped taking the beta blockers?
That's-that's crazy.
Why would he do that?
So he could sleep with your wife.
Look...
look, I loved Joe.
He was my brother.
I would never kill him.
Brothers kill brothers all the time, Ken.
Booth wants anything that could possibly link
Joe's brother to the murder.
Well, Hodgins might be leading us there.
With ducks and pigs?
Well, particulates from an Ancona duck,
Nigerian dwarf goat or a pot-bellied pig, to be exact.
But there are 322 farms and petting zoos and veterinary clinics in the area, which might have those breeds.
Well, Booth is not going to 322 farms.
Which is why I found a way to narrow it down even further.
Check this out.
Charlie's Barnyard.
The children's television show?
Now, look at the location.
See, the animals are kept in pens next to the parking lot at the same studios the Veg-Ta-Bills use.
Where his brother works.
There's oil spots all over in all these places.
I hope your little magic stick can find out where he was killed.
It's not a magic stick, Booth.
It's an alternative light source.
Okay, well, we need a little magic right now.
Found something.
Okay, what do we got?
This is definitely blood.
Well, the angle matches the fracture on the victim's parietal.
This where he fell and conked his head.
Yeah, and there's more blood here.
Oh!
We got a trail.
And it keeps going.
And it stops here.
Look at that.
Right up to the skid marks.
So, he was hit there;
his body was dragged here, up to these skid marks, which are... tires marks of a smaller car.
Well, we can match these tires to the ones found at the scene of the body dump.
Dr. Saroyan.
I don't think it's the brother.
I found a compound of propylene glycol, glyceryl stearate and hydrolyzed lupine protein from the kudzu runoff.
Those are cosmetic ingredients.
You already found those.
No, these are different.
And the concentrations are extremely high.
There's no way that Starkel got that much on him from being with one woman.
I ran the compound through an FDA database.
Turns out that it's unique to a moisturizer made by a Suzy James Cosmetics.
Wait a second, that's the company that Debra Ann Volker works for.
I already told you.
I respected Mr. Starkel.
I was grateful to him.
I'd never hurt him.
You didn't mean to.
He had a heart condition you couldn't have known about.
But he was so healthy.
No, he wasn't.
And the trunk of your car has Starkel's DNA and blood.
As well as cosmetics that were found on his clothing.
Plus your tires match the tires that were found at the site where the body was dumped.
He slept with so many women.
Why not me?
And you just, what, you wanted to get close to him?
I-I drove up behind him.
And I have an electric car, so I guess he didn't, he didn't hear me.
And I got right up to him, you know?
I just wanted to surprise him.
So I honked my horn.
You startled him.
But he just dropped.
And-and-and he hit his head on-on the parking block.
So I got out and I-I ran to him and I tried to help him.
But... he was just...
I...
I just wanted to get his attention, okay?
I-I just wanted him to see how good I look.
'Cause that was all because of him.
He died the instant you honked your horn.
So you put him in your car and you dumped his body.
You dumped his body.
I didn't know what else to do.
I didn't want anybody to think it was my fault.
But it was, Debra.

Ah, since the case is over, Dr. Saroyan, I thought it be okay for us to share a little wine.
Certainly make our conversation a lot easier.
I agree.
Okay, if we run out,
I have more in my office.
Really?
Yeah.
Doing what we do,
I'm surprised we all don't.
Please, sit.
O-Okay.
So, you-you want to... uh, to talk, um, about your book.
Yes.
I can't tell you how much it's meant to me that you guys all read my book.
As your friends, we-we want to be honest with you.
Of course.
But, uh, first, I would like if we could all raise our paper cups.
I can't imagine a more wonderful group of friends to share this good news with.
I'm being published.
What?
The same publishers who published Dr. Brennan.
They think my book is perfect for them.
They're promising a big release.
We-we... we should drink!
To-to Murder Made Me Do It.
Down the old hatch.
Now, look, I-I know that I'm published now, but I would really still like your feedback.
- So, uh...
- Well, I... for one, I-I loved it.
Me, too.
This is... the best book I've read in a long time.
It was riveting.
I gotta tell you,
I can't believe you all loved it.
I know.
Neither can I.
Published.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Hello.
Hey.
Where's Booth?
Oh, he's dealing with Ronnie the one-man band.
Bones.
Bones!
Bones, Bones, Bones!
Come here, come here.
Why are you wearing that?
What do you mean?
Well, Ronnie, Ronnie.
Look at him.
He's passed out, and I don't want him drooling all over the kids.
Well, you can't play that.
What-what do you mean I can't?
What?
You just do this.
One of these.
And Pops, you know, he taught me how to play the harmonica.
Listen.
Right?
Right.
So come on.
Help me in the back.
Make sure everything's all hooked up.
Christine is happy just playing with her friends, Booth.
Look, all right, I don't want to disappoint Christine.
I promised my little girl that I would get her the one-man band.
And that's what she's gonna get.
Okay.
What's happening?

- I want to play tag.
- No, no.
Let-let me just finish here, honey, okay?
No, Mommy said tag.
You're not afraid, are you?
I'm kind of at a disadvantage here.
Okay.
And Mommy always won.
Want to go?
I told her it was my favorite game.
Tag, you're it!
Tag, tag, tag!
Tempe always won.
Go get 'em!
Go get 'em!
Oh, no!
Don't get me!
Oh, did he get you?
Oh, you got me!
I'm It!
Oh, I'm at a serious disadvantage here, Bones.
Well, that's because you're playing me.
Ah!
Ha-ha!
You're It!
Fade to the left!
Go!
Get him!
Get him!

What's that mean?
I got it, why don't we rent a bouncy house for Christine's birthday party?
She'll love that.
Kids love to bounce up and down.
A recent study showed that over the past 10 years, approximately 65,000 children were treated for injuries received on bouncy houses.
Listen, you've already put the kibosh on the kickball party, the glow-stick party and the reptile guy.
Who doesn't like reptiles?
I don't see why she needs a party.
Kids just get cake all over themselves and fight over toy[.
They're little kids;
what could be better?
I mean, don't you remember your birthday party (sighs) when you were a little girl?
I never had one.
What?
!
Wait a second, you-you never had a birthday party?
That is correct and I didn't miss anything.
Okay.
Christine is dressed.
I'll drop her off at preschool on my way to the market.
Thanks, Dad.
Uh, no party, huh?
What?
Booth thinks I was deprived, because you never gave me any birthday parties as a child.
Well, you didn't have birthday parties, because that would draw attention to us and with the police looking for us, that's not a good thing.
Right.
Unbelievable.
I forgot-- fugitive.
Listen, if I had it to do over again, you would have birthday parties, but I ca-- I-I can't turn the clock back.
He's right, Booth;
the arrow of time--
(phone ringing)
Brennan.
Oh, okay.
It's coming into the lab?
Dot touch it until I get there.
(phone beeps)
Dad's taking my car.
I need a ride to the lab.
Remains are coming in.
Sure.
I got you.
No party, huh?
W-W-What do you want me to do?
Make a balloon animal for her now?
A book?
!
Yeah. 364 pages.
I never thought I could do it.
And it's a mystery?
Yeah.
Like Dr. B writes?
Yeah.
Same genre.
You know, write what you know.
Wow.
(laughs):
Oh...
The victim is in there?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, that, is awesome.
Wow, it's like the root system is pulling apart the bones.
And there's very little tissue remaining, but there should be enough for a tox screen.
I thought Dr. Brennan said not to touch it.
But... since you're the boss, it doesn't really matter what she wants.
HODGINS:
Kudzu.
Hey, man, this stuff grows about a foot a day, so I should be able to tell how long the victim's been in here.
There's staining and pitting on the bones.
HODGINS:
Yeah.
Kudzu excretes isoflavone aglycones to break down the surface of the bone so the roots can attach.
Hmm.
(leaves rustling)
What was that?
It's still growing.
It's feeding off the remaining tissue.
I've seen this movie.
It doesn't end well for humanity.
(leaves rustling)
Look, you shouldn't be upset with Max is Dr. Brennan isn't...
Oh, God.
It's encased.
It's like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
Yeah.
The squints are going to have a field day with that.
But when you're a little girl, you should be treated like a princess, not some criminal on the run.
Max was a criminal on the run, so Dr. Brennan's probably just sublimated those feelings as a way to cope.
And now she's just trying to justify it all by saying that a kid's birthday party isn't important.
But it is.
I would imagine so.
I've never been thrown a party either, so...
You too?
No.
Wow.
Yeah.
My dad was a drunk, and he threw me a birthday party every year.
The only time I ever saw him really sober.
It's probably why birthdays are so meaningful to you.
Tell you what, why don't you just, you know, shrink the photos.
Just focus on what you do best and I'll get the techs to go out to the crime scene and see if they can find any, uh, tire tracks and footprints.
When we get time of death, we might be able to match them up.
Okay.
MONTENEGRO:
Okay, this plant is covering too much of the skull for me to do a reconstruction.
Are you going to be able to remove the vegetation without compromising the remains, Dr. Hodgins?
Sort of my thing.
The size of the second cervical vertebra indicates the victim was male.
Animal predation appears to account for most of the tissue loss.
Yeah, the kudzu fed on the rest.
Guys, I, I don't even see the skull.
He's peeking through here, like an apparition appearing through a leafy fog.
I beg your pardon, Dr. Edison?
HODGINS:
Clark just finished writing a book.
It's a mystery, so you better watch out, Dr. B.
Why?
I doubt it will impact my sales.
Good for you, Clark.
I wouldn't have thought of you as a writer.
Well, after Nora and I broke up, I had a lot of free time.
I found, in the evenings, the words just poured out, so...
Your time is not free now, Dr. Edison.
Why are you even here, rather than an intern?
Forensic conference in Buffalo.
The interns got extra credit if they went.
Yeah, well, everyone should get extra credit for going to Buffalo.
Okay, then.
Which I will interpret as, "Welcome aboard."
Thank you.
The angular eye orbit indicates the victim is Caucasian.
The root system seems to have snaked its way through every opening.
(leaves rustling)
We need to remove the skull before it's damaged.
No problem.
Severing the roots around the orifices loosens the kudzu's hold.
See that?
SAROYAN:
Delicate work.
Yeah.
Very.
Hey, so are you going to do Christine's birthday party at the house, Dr. B?
Please concentrate, Dr. Hodgins.
HODGINS:
Ye of little faith.
The skull is free.
(leaves rustling)
Oh!
That is why I put no stock in faith!

♪
The root system has crushed the bones, Dr. Hodgins.
Yeah, and it is still growing.
Well, it might stop, if we can get out the remaining tissue and organs that it's feeding on.
I'm cutting as fast as I can, but the backseat driving isn't helping.
Dr. Edison is going to have a very difficult time reassembling the remains.
I've already asked for help from my department.
Here you go.
Ah, a portion of the liver.
The kudzu seemed to love it.
The roots have grown through the endosteum.
I don't even know what this is.
His prostate.
And it's still relatively intact.
It is always the last organ to go.
Does that mean that you can determine time of death?
Well, if the body's been outside since death, decomp would indicate at least six days.
Well, given the rate of growth of the kudzu, I'd say nine.
Eight?
Yeah.
Deal.
I'm gonna run this tissue for DNA and run a tox screen.
According to these pictures, looks like he pulled right up the embankment, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, and look, there are no footprints between where the car pulled up and where the body was found.
So, what-what, he got out of his car, right?
His feet didn't leave the asphalt, probably because he was afraid he was gonna be seen and he dumps the body as quickly as possible.
We're dealing with an amateur here.
He would have picked a more secluded spot.
Chances are, the killer was horrified by what he did.
Yeah.
Mm.
So you gonna... you gonna let Dr. Brennan help plan the party?
(tapping on table)
I will.
It would make her feel like a princess if she did.
(groans quietly)
Right.
That didn't go over well.
Here are a few more clean bones for you.
Oh, thank you.
These clean bones are really making reconstruction a lot easier.
So far, I know that the victim suffered sharp force trauma to the parietal;
the cross-shaped fractures indicative of someone that was struck from the left with a hard-shaped object.
So, a fight with a lefty before he was killed?
Yeah.
Looks that way.
You know, this might end up being a very exciting case.
Perhaps it was about love, or money, or love and money, or--
Easy does it there, Mr. Dickens.
Sure.
You know, I would love for you to read what I just finished.
I mean, I've already submitted to a publisher, but of course, I can make changes.
Yeah.
Sure.
BOOTH:
DNA said the victim is Joe Starkel.
So the victim's brother works for Merryvale Productions-- they make TV shows.
Apparently, the victim used to work there too.
What about a storyteller for the children?
I have the number of an excellent one to call.
That sounds promising.
I know!
Yeah.
He tells environmental tales about species who are dying on the Great Barrier Reef.
What?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
That sounds awful.
It's educational and poignant.
What's awful about that?
The words
"educational" and "poignant."
Just leave it to me, Bones.
I'm going for fun and more fun.
A lot of fun.
Trust me.
Mr. Starkel and the other performers are about to start shooting a scene.
He's the actor in green.
Thanks.

Loves the show.
She does?
What, do you really think that she's eating broccoli 'cause you told her there's a pint of fiber in it?
3.8 grams, as well as 20 percent of her vitamin A requirements.
Not to mention, an abundance of--
These are the Veg-Ta-Bills.
They're vegetables that are all named "Bill."
Corn is a fruit, not a vegetable.

We have to work on a new dance for that last part.
We can do better.
That was great.
It was great, great.
Carrots, corn and broccoli-- my man.
Who are you?
We're with the FBI.
Show him your badge.
Bones, wait till we...
We're here to inform you that your brother has been murdered.
And that corn is not a vegetable.
Oh, my God.
I'm just talking...
I can't believe Joe is dead.
Do you know how it happened?
We don't know all the details yet.
He was discovered being devoured by a patch of kudzu along the side of State Route 32.
Really?
What?
You don't follow the...?
Oh, God!
This is awful.
Can you think of anyone who'd want to hurt your brother?
No.
He was a wonderful guy.
He was the best man at our wedding.
Wait a second-- if your brother was Carrot Bill, who-who's that?
That's Tommy.
When Joe left, we had to find a replacement.
If Joe created the show, why did he leave?
He was working on developing a new show--
Mirthquake Village.
So you weren't upset that your brother left?
Sure-Sure, I was, at first.
They're brothers.
Brothers fight, right?
When was the last time either one of you saw him?
It's been a couple months.
He's pretty busy with his new show.
Look, we may have some more questions for you.
If you're thinking about leaving town,
I suggest you call that number first-- that's me.
Okay.
You have something for me, Dr. Edison?
Yes.
I would like you to read my book.
Dr. Hodgins is, and I would, uh, like to give you the chance as well.
You know what?
I am very busy.
Wouldn't Dr. Brennan be a better judge of your work?
I mean, she's a writer, too.
Mm, I'd rather get feedback from readers.
After all, that's who I wrote it for.
We should probably finish the case first, and then I'll try to get to it.
Great.
Now speaking of which,
I found remodeled fractures on the radius and ulna of both arms as well as the right fifth and eighth ribs.
Remodeling suggests that it was sustained about eight weeks ago.
A fight?
Yes.
His brother said everybody loved Joe.
I guess that wasn't the case.
Anything on cause of death yet?
No, not yet.
Okay.
Dr. Saroyan... you... forgot my book.
I look forward to your thoughts.
Of course.
Okay, check this out.
I found the perfect thing for Christine's birthday party.
Ronnie the One-Man Band?
Yes!
The one-man band!
Show me one person that doesn't like a one-man band.
I'm sure many don't like them, which is why they're such a rarity.
Help me out here, Sweets.
You like the one-man band?
I think this is really between the two of you.
Come on.
You know how hard Christine laughs when she watches Mary Poppins and Dick Van Dyke, you know, doing the one-man band.
(mimics percussion)
That is true.
True.
(text alert sounds)
Oh, you got a text here from Cam.
"Joe Starkel was in a serious fight about eight weeks ago."
That's when he was doing his new show.
Maybe someone on that show knows who fought with him.
Hold on a minute.
You're saying
Joe Starkel is dead?
Well, he got into a fight a few months ago, when he was working here.
Do you know anything about that?
No.
Uh, he was pretty irritable, though, because Mirthquake Village didn't turn out to be very good.
Look, I told Joe, real nice,
I was pulling the plug.
It's tough for a one-hit wonder to accept the truth, you know what I mean?
Jake, we need to talk.
I'm a little busy.
These nice people are with the FBI.
It'll just be a minute.
My character would never wear a crocodile belt.
Why the hell not?
You're a crocodile cowboy.
It's sick, a croc wearing croc.
Would you wear a human belt?
I agree with the crocodile.
Okay, Bones, that's enough.
Listen, you wouldn't happen to know a Joe Starkel?
Oh.
Oh, is that what this is about?
Yeah.
Is he finally filing charges, Jake?
Wear whatever the hell you want.
Just let me finish up here.
I'm sorry.
Charges?
What charges?
I don't know what he's babbling about.
CROCODILE COWBOY:
Well, it's no great secret, Jake.
Jake here and Joe, they got into it when Jake pulled the plug on Mirthquake.
Really?
A little tiff.
BRENNAN:
His injuries were extensive.
You fractured his ribs, mandible, zygomatic.
Funny how that slipped your mind.
Joe started it.
He freaked when
I told him I didn't want to do his show.
He came at me swinging.
I defended myself.
I was standing my ground.
SAROYAN:
So, how's it coming?
Actually, the detergent I used to loosen the vines from the bones cleaned off a ton of very interesting stuff.
And what did you find?
Well, so far, I found some motor oil that was on the victim.
And I'll try to match that to a specific car.
I also found a mixture of limestone, clay, fly ash, and gypsum.
Oh, uh, Portland cement.
It's my job to determine that, but you are absolutely right.
And I'm thoroughly impressed.
So what does it mean?
I'm not sure yet.
Could be a construction site.
But I believe the answer is in the runoff.
Have you, uh, started the book yet?
No.
I am so nervous.
I mean, what if it stinks?
But it could be great, right?
MONTENEGRO I just found out that the producer Starkel fought with was out of the country when he was killed.
But I think that I have a new suspect.
So, this is Carrot Bill's Twitter account.
SWEETS:
You mean Joe Starkel.
No.
This is the carrot's.
You'd be surprised about how many adult fans there are of the show.
Like this woman, Debra Ann Volker.
Her Twitter handle is SuperVeggieFanXOXO.
Carrot Bill was blocking her direct messages.
"I rely on you to guide my life.
"I trust in you.
Everything I am is because of you."
Okay, this is a woman that's showing signs of being obsessed.
Well, that's just the beginning.
Flash forward to just after Starkel left the Veg-Ta-Bills.
"I gave you everything.
You let me down.
"You will rot in hell, and I will make it happen." Wow.
She sent over 50 tweets in a 48-hour period, and this was the week before Starkel was killed.
Look at this picture she posted.
What, she Photoshopped herself into that?
It's crazy, right?
Uh, a grown woman obsessed with a giant orange phallic symbol?
Yeah, I'm comfortable calling her crazy.
VOLKER:
Carrot Bill dead?
I can't believe it.
He was the best vegetable.
Okay, you do realize that Carrot Bill is a fictional character?
Joe Starkel is the man that died.
I know.
I'm not insane, Dr. Sweets.
Shrinks always look for the crazy in everything.
I watch the Veg-Ta-Bills with my six-year-old son.
To him, the carrot is real.
Right.
Did you send these to Joe Starkel?
I'm kind of a Twitter freak, I guess.
That's a bit of an understatement.
Uh, "I want to peel you out of your carrot suit and eat you raw." Okay, okay, my son wasn't the only one who liked the show.
But you know what happens online.
You're anonymous, so you say things that you wouldn't face-to-face, right?
There are hundreds of these messages.
I mean, it starts with autograph requests and it moves on to wanting to meet, and then the stuff about eating his carrot.
I mean, that's-that's, cyberstalking, Ms. Volker.
Maybe I went a little overboard, but that show changed my life as much as my son's.
I was overweight, eating junk,
I had high blood pressure, and-and sleep apnea... but because of Carrot Bill,
I went from this, to what you see now.
He saved my life and my career.
I sell beauty products, which is very hard to do when you're 80 pounds overweight.
That is quite a change.
Well, I was terrified of putting this weight back on when he left the show.
So you saw the group as kind of a talisman for your good fortune then.
I've always been a little superstitious, I guess.
Have you always threatened people?
Why would I kill him?
Why?
He changed my life.
How are you doing with Joe Starkel's e-mails?
He deleted most of them using a multi-pass system used by the DoD.
Sounds like he was hiding something.
I guess we'll never know.
Well, maybe not.
I might be able to use a magnetic force microscopy to recover film fragments and piece them together.
Did you get anything else from the tox screens?
Nope.
He was one clean-living carrot.
Clark's book?
I only got through two chapters.
Pretty painful stuff.
Two pages of the sun setting over the remains of an itinerant stock broker.
So I found traces of asphalt with the concrete and oil.
I think the injuries might have taken place in a parking lot.
MONTENEGRO:
Oh, great.
So that narrows down the murder site to, like, a million places.
HODGINS:
Wow.
Snarky.
Oh, the book got you down?
Ooh... (clears throat)
"Death had never looked so dead as the death
"now in front of them,
"all life drained, only death covering the dead."
You think the victim was dead?
Please, I couldn't even get past chapter one.
Remember this?
"McDonald's farm was nestled in a glen, perfect for the final days of an old man."
Old McDonald had a farm?
Really?
Seriously?
What are we gonna tell him?
We're gonna tell him the truth.
That I've never read anything like it.
MONTENEGRO:
Oh, that's good.
Yeah.
It's, uh, one of a kind.
HODGINS:
Absolutely.
What's one of a kind?
Oh, uh, your book.
I've never read anything like it.
HODGINS:
Yeah, yeah.
You know, I've been very busy with the case, so I've only gotten through chapter one, but so far, it is just... (laughs) I mean...
Whew!
Well, you know, my feeling is, if the writer doesn't hook a reader in chapter one, he's not doing his job.
Look, I just don't want compliments.
I can take criticism.
Of-Of course.
Sure.
You-you got it.
Okay, great.
Now, um... oh.
I found some additional remodeled injuries, uh, this time to the sternum and lower ribs.
More recent than from the fight with the producer.
You know,
I hope we solve this soon so you can all finish reading.
Me, too.
Can't wait!
Chapter two awaits.
Right, right.
(laughs)
MAX:
It's so nice to have coffee with you.
We never to do this.
BRENNAN:
I know.
(Max sighs happily)
But something tells me this is about more than coffee.
It's Christine's party.
Booth is taking care of it and that makes me uncomfortable, because I have no frame of reference for an important event in my daughter's life.
Oh, honey... it wasn't that bad.
I mean, your mother and I did all we could.
You could have lived an honest life, Dad.
You know, sometimes circumstances move your life in a direction you never thought it would go.
What are you implying?
Well, your mother and I, we never intended to live outside the law.
I don't understand.
Then why did you?
I can't tell you why.
Not yet.
Certain people are out there... still alive... could get hurt.
And after all I've done,
I don't want to hurt anyone else.
That's not a real answer.
I...
I know, but you're just going to have to trust me.
It's not easy, Dad.
I'm sure it isn't.
But when all is said and done, honey, your childhood wasn't so bad.
You used to love playing tag when you were a kid.
Think back.
Come on.
You loved it.
And you... and you always got me.
(laughs)
I mean, you could... you-you would fade to your right and then, suddenly, you would slash through to your left...
Y-You could've played football.
I can still hear you laughing and squealing with joy every time you got me.
Isn't that reference enough for you to... to give Christine a good birthday?
BOOTH:
So what is the verdict?
Okay?
Is Debra Ann Volker capable of murder?
Well, she definitely suffers from celebrity worship syndrome.
Celebrity worship syndrome?
What is that?
Is that even a real thing?
Yeah.
It's an obsessive-addictive disorder.
I'll get you the literature on it, if you want.
Nah, I'll take your word for it.
So is she a killer?
Volker's tweets definitely place her at the borderline of pathological behavior.
And since there's no cause of death, we have nothing to link her, except that she's a wacko.
Well, wackos are kind of my thing.
Yeah, well, evidence is my thing, Sweets.
You know that. (phone ringing)
Hold on.
Ooh!
It's Ronnie!
Who's Ronnie?
Hey!
Ronnie!
Yeah!
Who's Ronnie?
Thanks, bud, for getting back to me.
He's a one-man-band.
Oh...
Okay.
Now?
Great.
He's going to play a song for us.
Now?
Yeah, li... (whimsical music playing) Huh?
It's pretty cool.
Right?
(laughs)
This guy's a genius.
The fractures to the body of the sternum, the xiphoid process and the surrounding ribs appear to be related to chest compressions.
CLARK:
Which were sustained about five months ago.
Now, what's odd is that for someone who appears to have been assaulted at time of death, there are no Colles fractures to the distal radius, or humeral head breaks.
Which suggests the victim didn't try to break his fall.
Hmm.
Because he lost consciousness.
But none of the injuries he sustained would have be enough to render him unconscious.
Yeah, and Dr. Saroyan said his tox screens came back clear, so no drugs or alcohol.
Which means there's a cause we're not seeing.
And that calls for imagination.
Well, it's what we writers do, isn't it?
But scientists require facts, not flights of fancy.
True.
Of course.
Congratulations on finishing your novel, Clark.
I know what an achievement that is.
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.
Booth.
MONTENEGRO:
I reconstructed Joe Starkel's deleted e-mails.
Apparently, he wanted to be Carrot Bill again.
His brother never mentioned anything about that.
Well, these weren't to his brother.
They were to the head of the company that produced the Veg-Ta-Bills, Henry Munson.
"Munson"?
Whoa, wait a second.
The new Carrot Bill is Tommy Munson.
I know.
Tommy is Henry Munson's son.
Look, I didn't have any problems with Joe.
He was a great guy.
No?
No problems at all?
Okay, Daddy didn't tell you that Joe wanted his job back?
Yeah.
Sure he did.
What about it?
Okay, and that didn't make you upset, that you were probably going to be replaced?
That's what I thought at first.
But then Joe called me and told me he was coming up with a whole new character for me.
Wait a second-
- Joe called you, not his brother?
Yeah, he and his brother fought all the time.
They're both artist types.
He wanted to work it out with me first.
I was either going to be an asparagus or a Brussels sprout.
But I was pushing for the asparagus, so... so I wouldn't lose the phallic thing.
Right.
Got it.
Okay.
But the overall deal would be if Joe rejoins the group, you would be getting a pay cut.
Oh, I was never in it for the money.
Why, because your daddy's rich?
No.
Because of the moms.
I was in it for them.
The moms...?
Joe cleaned up for years.
A few moms would slip him their phone numbers after every show.
Then, when I got into the carrot suit, it worked for me, too.
That's why I wanted to be an asparagus.
Right.
Okay.
When was the last time you saw Joe?
A week ago Tuesday.
I was supposed to meet up with him after the show to talk through some concepts, but he never showed up.
Right, let me guess... uh, no one knew that you were going to meet Joe.
Well, yeah, of course.
Look-look, like I said,
Joe wanted this to be just between us until we worked out all the details.
So you don't have an alibi the day that Joe disappeared.
I didn't kill Joe.
Okay?
You...
you have to believe me.
I'm just trying to get the facts here, Mr. Carrot, and it's not looking too good for you.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT:
We're ready!
We need the carrot!
Hey.
I found traces of castoreum, ambergris, musk... which is perfume.
I also found tartrazine and glycol distearate, which is found in lipstick.
Oh.
Well, that makes sense.
Apparently, he slept with a lot of women.
Listen, honey, um... we have a problem.
What?
Clark's book.
We have to be honest with him.
I mean, nobody is ever gonna publish it.
Well, it's not up to us, Angie.
We don't have a choice.
He asked to see us so that we could talk about the book.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
After we finish the case.
I don't suppose it's ethical to take a lot more time to catch a killer.
We're his friends.
I...
I just think we should be straight with him.
Man...
I hate it when you act like an adult.
What'd you find?
Dr. Brennan told me to take another look at the fractures on the body of the sternum.
Another fight?
No, these are three months before the fight.
I've heard of people hating their vegetables before, but this was one despised carrot.
These injuries weren't from a fight.
The fracturing to the ribs and sternum, these fractures run laterally, caused by repeated forceful compression of the rib cage.
CPR?
Almost certainly.
So he might have had a heart attack five months ago.
And if he still had a heart condition, it would explain him dropping without breaking his fall.
But it wouldn't explain why someone would dump him into a pile of kudzu.
Starkel was admitted to Mountview General two years ago, with a rare heart condition called Long QT Syndrome.
Sounds like a dude ranch.
It's a condition which increases the risk of episodes of torsades de pointes.
Wow.
What's that?
It's potentially fatal arrhythmia provoked by various stimuli.
Like what?
Anything that could startle you-- a loud noise or a sudden shock.
That's a hell of a way to go through life.
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.
Well, beta blockers are used to treat the condition quite effectively.
All right, then what killed him?
He wasn't taking his medication.
Cam's tox screen came back negative for all drugs, even the beta blockers.
Why would a guy with a deadly condition not take his medication?
Men have been known to stop taking beta blockers because of a strong...
side effect.
Oh.
Impotence.
Munson said that Starkel was sleeping around.
So obviously, I guess he decided that sex was more important than staying alive.
Someone could have known his condition and figured it was a perfect way to kill him.
Oh, wow, that is just cold.
Oh, oh, oh, I...
oh, I almost forgot.
I almost forgot.
I set up the whole, uh, one man band ready to go for Christine's birthday party.
He's going to kill it!
(imitates drums, horn)
I was thinking, Booth...
Since we'll be in the park,
I thought we could play tag.
Sure.
Tag is fun.
See, you know how to have fun.
You're not gonna catch me, though.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.
I am quite good at tag.
Come on.
I used to be a Ranger, okay?
You're never gonna catch me.
We'll see.
HODGINS:
Hey.
So I found duck poo, pig bristle and goat hairs in the kudzu run-off.
Why do you get to have all the fun?
The animal particles, as well as everything else we found, suggest that Starkel could have been killed in a parking lot near a farm.
But there are no farms close to where the body was dumped.
What are you up to?
Well, I decided to search
Starkel's credit card charges, to see if it's possible to track his movements on the day he died.
Nailed it, I'm sure.
Well, no.
He didn't charge anything that day.
But it did give me an idea.
I expanded the search to include all of Starkel's credit card activity over the past two months, right?
Then I cross-referenced those charges against the credit card activity of all of our suspects.
I have married Big Brother.
Interesting result.
Credit card and debit card purchases of the victim and of Marilyn Starkel intersect several times.
Look.
Joe Starkel rents a room at the Tidefront Motel.
And here
Marilyn buys gas the following morning, next-door.
Okay.
Here's another one.
A hotel stay on Joe's card.
And then a trip to the closest drug store by Marilyn that same night.
Now, these two don't live anywhere near each other.
So, Carrot Bill is having an affair with his brother's wife.
And his brother would definitely know about his heart condition.
We talked to your wife, okay?
She claims that you knew, okay?
That she was having an affair with your brother.
Marilyn and I are both artists, Agent Booth.
We believe in letting our creative side out to play.
"Letting your creative side out to play."
What does that have to do with anything?
She was following her feelings, which I support.
We have an open relationship.
You have an open relationship?
Really?
That's really convenient for you to say right now.
The fact is that you knew that your brother had a medical condition, so you thought you could scare him so you can get away with murder.
I couldn't do that even if I wanted to.
Joe was on medication.
He had it under control.
You're saying you didn't know that your brother stopped taking the beta blockers?
That's-that's crazy.
Why would he do that?
So he could sleep with your wife.
Look...
look, I loved Joe.
He was my brother.
I would never kill him.
Brothers kill brothers all the time, Ken.
Booth wants anything that could possibly link
Joe's brother to the murder.
Well, Hodgins might be leading us there.
With ducks and pigs?
Well, particulates from an Ancona duck,
Nigerian dwarf goat or a pot-bellied pig, to be exact.
MONTENEGRO:
But there are 322 farms and petting zoos and veterinary clinics in the area, which might have those breeds.
Well, Booth is not going to 322 farms.
Which is why I found a way to narrow it down even further.
Check this out.
Charlie's Barnyard.
The children's television show?
Now, look at the location.
HODGINS:
See, the animals are kept in pens next to the parking lot at the same studios the Veg-Ta-Bills use.
Where his brother works.
There's oil spots all over in all these places.
I hope your little magic stick can find out where he was killed.
It's not a magic stick, Booth.
It's an alternative light source.
Okay, well, we need a little magic right now.
Found something.
Okay, what do we got?
This is definitely blood.
Well, the angle matches the fracture on the victim's parietal.
This where he fell and conked his head.
Yeah, and there's more blood here.
BOOTH:
Oh!
We got a trail.
BRENNAN:
And it keeps going.
And it stops here.
Look at that.
Right up to the skid marks.
So, he was hit there;
his body was dragged here, up to these skid marks, which are...
(chuckles) tires marks of a smaller car.
Well, we can match these tires to the ones found
(phone ringing) at the scene of the body dump.
Dr. Saroyan.
I don't think it's the brother.
I found a compound of propylene glycol, glyceryl stearate and hydrolyzed lupine protein from the kudzu runoff.
Those are cosmetic ingredients.
You already found those.
No, these are different.
And the concentrations are extremely high.
There's no way that Starkel got that much on him from being with one woman.
HODGINS:
I ran the compound through an FDA database.
Turns out that it's unique to a moisturizer made by a Suzy James Cosmetics.
Wait a second, that's the company that Debra Ann Volker works for.
I already told you.
I respected Mr. Starkel.
I was grateful to him.
I'd never hurt him.
You didn't mean to.
He had a heart condition you couldn't have known about.
But he was so healthy.
No, he wasn't.
And the trunk of your car has Starkel's DNA and blood.
BRENNAN:
As well as cosmetics that were found on his clothing.
Plus your tires match the tires that were found at the site where the body was dumped.
(voice breaking):
He slept with so many women.
Why not me?
And you just, what, you wanted to get close to him?
I-I drove up behind him.
And I have an electric car, so I guess he didn't, he didn't hear me.
And I got right up to him, you know?
I just wanted to surprise him.
So I honked my horn.
You startled him.
But he just dropped.
And-and-and he hit his head on-on the parking block.
So I got out and I-I ran to him and I tried to help him.
But... he was just...
I...
I just wanted to get his attention, okay?
I-I just wanted him to see how good I look.
'Cause that was all because of him.
He died the instant you honked your horn.
So you put him in your car and you dumped his body.
You dumped his body.
I didn't know what else to do.
I didn't want anybody to think it was my fault.
But it was, Debra.

Ah, since the case is over, Dr. Saroyan, I thought it be okay for us to share a little wine.
Certainly make our conversation a lot easier.
I agree.
Okay, if we run out,
I have more in my office.
Really?
Yeah.
Doing what we do,
I'm surprised we all don't.
Please, sit.
O-Okay.
(clears throat)
(sighs)
(exhales) So, you-you want to... uh, to talk, um, about your book.
Yes.
I can't tell you how much it's meant to me that you guys all read my book.
As your friends, we-we want to be honest with you.
Of course.
But, uh, first, I would like if we could all raise our paper cups.
I can't imagine a more wonderful group of friends to share this good news with.
I'm being published.
What?
The same publishers who published Dr. Brennan.
They think my book is perfect for them.
They're promising a big release.
We-we... we should drink!
To-to Murder Made Me Do It.
Down the old hatch.
Now, look, I-I know that I'm published now, but I would really still like your feedback.
So, uh...
MONTENEGRO:
Well, I... for one, I-I loved it.
SAROYAN:
Me, too.
This is... the best book I've read in a long time.
It was riveting.
I gotta tell you,
I can't believe you all loved it.
I know.
Neither can I.
Published.
Yeah.
BRENNAN (laughing):
Oh, no.
Hello.
Hey.
Where's Booth?
Oh, he's dealing with Ronnie the one-man band.
(drumming, clanging)
Bones.
Bones!
Bones, Bones, Bones!
Come here, come here.
(squeaking)
Why are you wearing that?
What do you mean?
Well, Ronnie, Ronnie.
Look at him.
He's passed out, and I don't want him drooling all over the kids.
Well, you can't play that.
What-what do you mean I can't?
What?
You just do this.
(cymbal clangs)
One of these.
(plays accordion, squeaks)
And Pops, you know, he taught me how to play the harmonica.
Listen.
(plays harmonica)
(chuckles) Right?
(plays accordion)
Right.
So come on.
Help me in the back.
Make sure everything's all hooked up.
(plays accordion)
Christine is happy just playing with her friends, Booth.
Look, all right, I don't want to disappoint Christine.
I promised my little girl that I would get her the one-man band.
(plays accordion) And that's what she's gonna get.
(plays harmonica) Okay.
(Booth playing lively song) What's happening?
(applause, cheering)
Hey!
ALL: ♪ Happy birthday ♪

BOOTH:
No, no.
Let-let me just finish here, honey, okay?
No, Mommy said tag.
You're not afraid, are you?
I'm kind of at a disadvantage here.
Okay.
And Mommy always won.
Want to go?
I told her it was my favorite game.
Tag, you're it!
Tag, tag, tag!
(drum thumping)
Tempe always won.
Go get 'em!
Go get 'em!

(horn honking)
(laughing)
Oh, no!
Don't get me!
Oh, did he get you?
(laughing, yelling happily)
Oh, you got me!
I'm It!
(laughs)
Oh, I'm at a serious disadvantage here, Bones.
Well, that's because you're playing me.
Ah!
Ha-ha!
You're It!
Fade to the left!
Go!
MONTENEGRO:
Get him!
Get him!
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
What's that mean?
I got it, why don't we rent a bouncy house for Christine's birthday party?
She'll love that.
Kids love to bounce up and down.
A recent study showed that over the past 10 years, approximately 65,000 children were treated for injuries received on bouncy houses.
Listen, you've already put the kibosh on the kickball party, the glow-stick party and the reptile guy.
Who doesn't like reptiles?
I don't see why she needs a party.
Kids just get cake all over themselves and fight over toy[.
They're little kids;
what could be better?
I mean, don't you remember your birthday party (sighs) when you were a little girl?
I never had one.
What?
!
Wait a second, you-you never had a birthday party?
That is correct and I didn't miss anything.
Okay.
Christine is dressed.
I'll drop her off at preschool on my way to the market.
Thanks, Dad.
Uh, no party, huh?
What?
Booth thinks I was deprived, because you never gave me any birthday parties as a child.
Well, you didn't have birthday parties, because that would draw attention to us and with the police looking for us, that's not a good thing.
Right.
Unbelievable.
I forgot-- fugitive.
Listen, if I had it to do over again, you would have birthday parties, but I ca-- I-I can't turn the clock back.
He's right, Booth;
the arrow of time--
(phone ringing)
Brennan.
Oh, okay.
It's coming into the lab?
Dot touch it until I get there.
(phone beeps)
Dad's taking my car.
I need a ride to the lab.
Remains are coming in.
Sure.
I got you.
No party, huh?
W-W-What do you want me to do?
Make a balloon animal for her now?
A book?
!
Yeah. 364 pages.
I never thought I could do it.
And it's a mystery?
Yeah.
Like Dr. B writes?
Yeah.
Same genre.
You know, write what you know.
Wow.
(laughs):
Oh...
The victim is in there?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, that, is awesome.
Wow, it's like the root system is pulling apart the bones.
And there's very little tissue remaining, but there should be enough for a tox screen.
I thought Dr. Brennan said not to touch it.
But... since you're the boss, it doesn't really matter what she wants.
HODGINS:
Kudzu.
Hey, man, this stuff grows about a foot a day, so I should be able to tell how long the victim's been in here.
There's staining and pitting on the bones.
HODGINS:
Yeah.
Kudzu excretes isoflavone aglycones to break down the surface of the bone so the roots can attach.
Hmm.
(leaves rustling)
What was that?
It's still growing.
It's feeding off the remaining tissue.
I've seen this movie.
It doesn't end well for humanity.
(leaves rustling)
Look, you shouldn't be upset with Max is Dr. Brennan isn't...
Oh, God.
It's encased.
It's like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
Yeah.
The squints are going to have a field day with that.
But when you're a little girl, you should be treated like a princess, not some criminal on the run.
Max was a criminal on the run, so Dr. Brennan's probably just sublimated those feelings as a way to cope.
And now she's just trying to justify it all by saying that a kid's birthday party isn't important.
But it is.
I would imagine so.
I've never been thrown a party either, so...
You too?
No.
Wow.
Yeah.
My dad was a drunk, and he threw me a birthday party every year.
The only time I ever saw him really sober.
It's probably why birthdays are so meaningful to you.
Tell you what, why don't you just, you know, shrink the photos.
Just focus on what you do best and I'll get the techs to go out to the crime scene and see if they can find any, uh, tire tracks and footprints.
When we get time of death, we might be able to match them up.
Okay.
MONTENEGRO:
Okay, this plant is covering too much of the skull for me to do a reconstruction.
Are you going to be able to remove the vegetation without compromising the remains, Dr. Hodgins?
Sort of my thing.
The size of the second cervical vertebra indicates the victim was male.
Animal predation appears to account for most of the tissue loss.
Yeah, the kudzu fed on the rest.
Guys, I, I don't even see the skull.
He's peeking through here, like an apparition appearing through a leafy fog.
I beg your pardon, Dr. Edison?
HODGINS:
Clark just finished writing a book.
It's a mystery, so you better watch out, Dr. B.
Why?
I doubt it will impact my sales.
Good for you, Clark.
I wouldn't have thought of you as a writer.
Well, after Nora and I broke up, I had a lot of free time.
I found, in the evenings, the words just poured out, so...
Your time is not free now, Dr. Edison.
Why are you even here, rather than an intern?
Forensic conference in Buffalo.
The interns got extra credit if they went.
Yeah, well, everyone should get extra credit for going to Buffalo.
Okay, then.
Which I will interpret as, "Welcome aboard."
Thank you.
The angular eye orbit indicates the victim is Caucasian.
The root system seems to have snaked its way through every opening.
(leaves rustling)
We need to remove the skull before it's damaged.
No problem.
Severing the roots around the orifices loosens the kudzu's hold.
See that?
SAROYAN:
Delicate work.
Yeah.
Very.
Hey, so are you going to do Christine's birthday party at the house, Dr. B?
Please concentrate, Dr. Hodgins.
HODGINS:
Ye of little faith.
The skull is free.
(leaves rustling)
Oh!
That is why I put no stock in faith!

The root system has crushed the bones, Dr. Hodgins.
Yeah, and it is still growing.
Well, it might stop, if we can get out the remaining tissue and organs that it's feeding on.
I'm cutting as fast as I can, but the backseat driving isn't helping.
Dr. Edison is going to have a very difficult time reassembling the remains.
I've already asked for help from my department.
Here you go.
Ah, a portion of the liver.
The kudzu seemed to love it.
The roots have grown through the endosteum.
I don't even know what this is.
His prostate.
And it's still relatively intact.
It is always the last organ to go.
Does that mean that you can determine time of death?
Well, if the body's been outside since death, decomp would indicate at least six days.
Well, given the rate of growth of the kudzu, I'd say nine.
Eight?
Yeah.
Deal.
I'm gonna run this tissue for DNA and run a tox screen.
According to these pictures, looks like he pulled right up the embankment, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, and look, there are no footprints between where the car pulled up and where the body was found.
So, what-what, he got out of his car, right?
His feet didn't leave the asphalt, probably because he was afraid he was gonna be seen and he dumps the body as quickly as possible.
We're dealing with an amateur here.
He would have picked a more secluded spot.
Chances are, the killer was horrified by what he did.
Yeah.
Mm.
So you gonna... you gonna let Dr. Brennan help plan the party?
(tapping on table)
I will.
It would make her feel like a princess if she did.
(groans quietly)
Right.
That didn't go over well.
Here are a few more clean bones for you.
Oh, thank you.
These clean bones are really making reconstruction a lot easier.
So far, I know that the victim suffered sharp force trauma to the parietal;
the cross-shaped fractures indicative of someone that was struck from the left with a hard-shaped object.
So, a fight with a lefty before he was killed?
Yeah.
Looks that way.
You know, this might end up being a very exciting case.
Perhaps it was about love, or money, or love and money, or--
Easy does it there, Mr. Dickens.
Sure.
You know, I would love for you to read what I just finished.
I mean, I've already submitted to a publisher, but of course, I can make changes.
Yeah.
Sure.
BOOTH:
DNA said the victim is Joe Starkel.
So the victim's brother works for Merryvale Productions-- they make TV shows.
Apparently, the victim used to work there too.
What about a storyteller for the children?
I have the number of an excellent one to call.
That sounds promising.
I know!
Yeah.
He tells environmental tales about species who are dying on the Great Barrier Reef.
What?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
That sounds awful.
It's educational and poignant.
What's awful about that?
The words
"educational" and "poignant."
Just leave it to me, Bones.
I'm going for fun and more fun.
A lot of fun.
Trust me.
Mr. Starkel and the other performers are about to start shooting a scene.
He's the actor in green.
Thanks.

Carrots, corn and broccoli-- my man.
Who are you?
We're with the FBI.
Show him your badge.
Bones, wait till we...
We're here to inform you that your brother has been murdered.
And that corn is not a vegetable.
Oh, my God.
I'm just talking...
I can't believe Joe is dead.
Do you know how it happened?
We don't know all the details yet.
He was discovered being devoured by a patch of kudzu along the side of State Route 32.
Really?
What?
You don't follow the...?
Oh, God!
This is awful.
Can you think of anyone who'd want to hurt your brother?
No.
He was a wonderful guy.
He was the best man at our wedding.
Wait a second-- if your brother was Carrot Bill, who-who's that?
That's Tommy.
When Joe left, we had to find a replacement.
If Joe created the show, why did he leave?
He was working on developing a new show--
Mirthquake Village.
So you weren't upset that your brother left?
Sure-Sure, I was, at first.
They're brothers.
Brothers fight, right?
When was the last time either one of you saw him?
It's been a couple months.
He's pretty busy with his new show.
Look, we may have some more questions for you.
If you're thinking about leaving town,
I suggest you call that number first-- that's me.
Okay.
You have something for me, Dr. Edison?
Yes.
I would like you to read my book.
Dr. Hodgins is, and I would, uh, like to give you the chance as well.
You know what?
I am very busy.
Wouldn't Dr. Brennan be a better judge of your work?
I mean, she's a writer, too.
Mm, I'd rather get feedback from readers.
After all, that's who I wrote it for.
We should probably finish the case first, and then I'll try to get to it.
Great.
Now speaking of which,
I found remodeled fractures on the radius and ulna of both arms as well as the right fifth and eighth ribs.
Remodeling suggests that it was sustained about eight weeks ago.
A fight?
Yes.
His brother said everybody loved Joe.
I guess that wasn't the case.
Anything on cause of death yet?
No, not yet.
Okay.
Dr. Saroyan... you... forgot my book.
I look forward to your thoughts.
Of course.
Okay, check this out.
I found the perfect thing for Christine's birthday party.
Ronnie the One-Man Band?
Yes!
The one-man band!
Show me one person that doesn't like a one-man band.
I'm sure many don't like them, which is why they're such a rarity.
Help me out here, Sweets.
You like the one-man band?
I think this is really between the two of you.
Come on.
You know how hard Christine laughs when she watches Mary Poppins and Dick Van Dyke, you know, doing the one-man band.
(mimics percussion)
That is true.
True.
(text alert sounds)
Oh, you got a text here from Cam.
"Joe Starkel was in a serious fight about eight weeks ago."
That's when he was doing his new show.
Maybe someone on that show knows who fought with him.
Hold on a minute.
You're saying
Joe Starkel is dead?
Well, he got into a fight a few months ago, when he was working here.
Do you know anything about that?
No.
Uh, he was pretty irritable, though, because Mirthquake Village didn't turn out to be very good.
Look, I told Joe, real nice,
I was pulling the plug.
It's tough for a one-hit wonder to accept the truth, you know what I mean?
Jake, we need to talk.
I'm a little busy.
These nice people are with the FBI.
It'll just be a minute.
My character would never wear a crocodile belt.
Why the hell not?
You're a crocodile cowboy.
It's sick, a croc wearing croc.
Would you wear a human belt?
I agree with the crocodile.
Okay, Bones, that's enough.
Listen, you wouldn't happen to know a Joe Starkel?
Oh.
Oh, is that what this is about?
Yeah.
Is he finally filing charges, Jake?
Wear whatever the hell you want.
Just let me finish up here.
I'm sorry.
Charges?
What charges?
I don't know what he's babbling about.
CROCODILE COWBOY:
Well, it's no great secret, Jake.
Jake here and Joe, they got into it when Jake pulled the plug on Mirthquake.
Really?
A little tiff.
BRENNAN:
His injuries were extensive.
You fractured his ribs, mandible, zygomatic.
Funny how that slipped your mind.
Joe started it.
He freaked when
I told him I didn't want to do his show.
He came at me swinging.
I defended myself.
I was standing my ground.
SAROYAN:
So, how's it coming?
Actually, the detergent I used to loosen the vines from the bones cleaned off a ton of very interesting stuff.
And what did you find?
Well, so far, I found some motor oil that was on the victim.
And I'll try to match that to a specific car.
I also found a mixture of limestone, clay, fly ash, and gypsum.
Oh, uh, Portland cement.
It's my job to determine that, but you are absolutely right.
And I'm thoroughly impressed.
So what does it mean?
I'm not sure yet.
Could be a construction site.
But I believe the answer is in the runoff.
Have you, uh, started the book yet?
No.
I am so nervous.
I mean, what if it stinks?
But it could be great, right?
MONTENEGRO I just found out that the producer Starkel fought with was out of the country when he was killed.
But I think that I have a new suspect.
So, this is Carrot Bill's Twitter account.
SWEETS:
You mean Joe Starkel.
No.
This is the carrot's.
You'd be surprised about how many adult fans there are of the show.
Like this woman, Debra Ann Volker.
Her Twitter handle is SuperVeggieFanXOXO.
Carrot Bill was blocking her direct messages.
"I rely on you to guide my life.
"I trust in you.
Everything I am is because of you."
Okay, this is a woman that's showing signs of being obsessed.
Well, that's just the beginning.
Flash forward to just after Starkel left the Veg-Ta-Bills.
"I gave you everything.
You let me down.
"You will rot in hell, and I will make it happen." Wow.
She sent over 50 tweets in a 48-hour period, and this was the week before Starkel was killed.
Look at this picture she posted.
What, she Photoshopped herself into that?
It's crazy, right?
Uh, a grown woman obsessed with a giant orange phallic symbol?
Yeah, I'm comfortable calling her crazy.
VOLKER:
Carrot Bill dead?
I can't believe it.
He was the best vegetable.
Okay, you do realize that Carrot Bill is a fictional character?
Joe Starkel is the man that died.
I know.
I'm not insane, Dr. Sweets.
Shrinks always look for the crazy in everything.
I watch the Veg-Ta-Bills with my six-year-old son.
To him, the carrot is real.
Right.
Did you send these to Joe Starkel?
I'm kind of a Twitter freak, I guess.
That's a bit of an understatement.
Uh, "I want to peel you out of your carrot suit and eat you raw." Okay, okay, my son wasn't the only one who liked the show.
But you know what happens online.
You're anonymous, so you say things that you wouldn't face-to-face, right?
There are hundreds of these messages.
I mean, it starts with autograph requests and it moves on to wanting to meet, and then the stuff about eating his carrot.
I mean, that's-that's, cyberstalking, Ms. Volker.
Maybe I went a little overboard, but that show changed my life as much as my son's.
I was overweight, eating junk,
I had high blood pressure, and-and sleep apnea... but because of Carrot Bill,
I went from this, to what you see now.
He saved my life and my career.
I sell beauty products, which is very hard to do when you're 80 pounds overweight.
That is quite a change.
Well, I was terrified of putting this weight back on when he left the show.
So you saw the group as kind of a talisman for your good fortune then.
I've always been a little superstitious, I guess.
Have you always threatened people?
Why would I kill him?
Why?
He changed my life.
How are you doing with Joe Starkel's e-mails?
He deleted most of them using a multi-pass system used by the DoD.
Sounds like he was hiding something.
I guess we'll never know.
Well, maybe not.
I might be able to use a magnetic force microscopy to recover film fragments and piece them together.
Did you get anything else from the tox screens?
Nope.
He was one clean-living carrot.
Clark's book?
I only got through two chapters.
Pretty painful stuff.
Two pages of the sun setting over the remains of an itinerant stock broker.
So I found traces of asphalt with the concrete and oil.
I think the injuries might have taken place in a parking lot.
MONTENEGRO:
Oh, great.
So that narrows down the murder site to, like, a million places.
HODGINS:
Wow.
Snarky.
Oh, the book got you down?
Ooh... (clears throat)
"Death had never looked so dead as the death
"now in front of them,
"all life drained, only death covering the dead."
You think the victim was dead?
Please, I couldn't even get past chapter one.
Remember this?
"McDonald's farm was nestled in a glen, perfect for the final days of an old man."
Old McDonald had a farm?
Really?
Seriously?
What are we gonna tell him?
We're gonna tell him the truth.
That I've never read anything like it.
MONTENEGRO:
Oh, that's good.
Yeah.
It's, uh, one of a kind.
HODGINS:
Absolutely.
What's one of a kind?
Oh, uh, your book.
I've never read anything like it.
HODGINS:
Yeah, yeah.
You know, I've been very busy with the case, so I've only gotten through chapter one, but so far, it is just... (laughs) I mean...
Whew!
Well, you know, my feeling is, if the writer doesn't hook a reader in chapter one, he's not doing his job.
Look, I just don't want compliments.
I can take criticism.
Of-Of course.
Sure.
You-you got it.
Okay, great.
Now, um... oh.
I found some additional remodeled injuries, uh, this time to the sternum and lower ribs.
More recent than from the fight with the producer.
You know,
I hope we solve this soon so you can all finish reading.
Me, too.
Can't wait!
Chapter two awaits.
Right, right.
(laughs)
MAX:
It's so nice to have coffee with you.
We never to do this.
BRENNAN:
I know.
(Max sighs happily)
But something tells me this is about more than coffee.
It's Christine's party.
Booth is taking care of it and that makes me uncomfortable, because I have no frame of reference for an important event in my daughter's life.
Oh, honey... it wasn't that bad.
I mean, your mother and I did all we could.
You could have lived an honest life, Dad.
You know, sometimes circumstances move your life in a direction you never thought it would go.
What are you implying?
Well, your mother and I, we never intended to live outside the law.
I don't understand.
Then why did you?
I can't tell you why.
Not yet.
Certain people are out there... still alive... could get hurt.
And after all I've done,
I don't want to hurt anyone else.
That's not a real answer.
I...
I know, but you're just going to have to trust me.
It's not easy, Dad.
I'm sure it isn't.
But when all is said and done, honey, your childhood wasn't so bad.
You used to love playing tag when you were a kid.
Think back.
Come on.
You loved it.
And you... and you always got me.
(laughs)
I mean, you could... you-you would fade to your right and then, suddenly, you would slash through to your left...
Y-You could've played football.
I can still hear you laughing and squealing with joy every time you got me.
Isn't that reference enough for you to... to give Christine a good birthday?
BOOTH:
So what is the verdict?
Okay?
Is Debra Ann Volker capable of murder?
Well, she definitely suffers from celebrity worship syndrome.
Celebrity worship syndrome?
What is that?
Is that even a real thing?
Yeah.
It's an obsessive-addictive disorder.
I'll get you the literature on it, if you want.
Nah, I'll take your word for it.
So is she a killer?
Volker's tweets definitely place her at the borderline of pathological behavior.
And since there's no cause of death, we have nothing to link her, except that she's a wacko.
Well, wackos are kind of my thing.
Yeah, well, evidence is my thing, Sweets.
You know that. (phone ringing)
Hold on.
Ooh!
It's Ronnie!
Who's Ronnie?
Hey!
Ronnie!
Yeah!
Who's Ronnie?
Thanks, bud, for getting back to me.
He's a one-man-band.
Oh...
Okay.
Now?
Great.
He's going to play a song for us.
Now?
Yeah, li... (whimsical music playing) Huh?
It's pretty cool.
Right?
(laughs)
This guy's a genius.
The fractures to the body of the sternum, the xiphoid process and the surrounding ribs appear to be related to chest compressions.
CLARK:
Which were sustained about five months ago.
Now, what's odd is that for someone who appears to have been assaulted at time of death, there are no Colles fractures to the distal radius, or humeral head breaks.
Which suggests the victim didn't try to break his fall.
Hmm.
Because he lost consciousness.
But none of the injuries he sustained would have be enough to render him unconscious.
Yeah, and Dr. Saroyan said his tox screens came back clear, so no drugs or alcohol.
Which means there's a cause we're not seeing.
And that calls for imagination.
Well, it's what we writers do, isn't it?
But scientists require facts, not flights of fancy.
True.
Of course.
Congratulations on finishing your novel, Clark.
I know what an achievement that is.
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.
Booth.
MONTENEGRO:
I reconstructed Joe Starkel's deleted e-mails.
Apparently, he wanted to be Carrot Bill again.
His brother never mentioned anything about that.
Well, these weren't to his brother.
They were to the head of the company that produced the Veg-Ta-Bills, Henry Munson.
"Munson"?
Whoa, wait a second.
The new Carrot Bill is Tommy Munson.
I know.
Tommy is Henry Munson's son.
Look, I didn't have any problems with Joe.
He was a great guy.
No?
No problems at all?
Okay, Daddy didn't tell you that Joe wanted his job back?
Yeah.
Sure he did.
What about it?
Okay, and that didn't make you upset, that you were probably going to be replaced?
That's what I thought at first.
But then Joe called me and told me he was coming up with a whole new character for me.
Wait a second-
- Joe called you, not his brother?
Yeah, he and his brother fought all the time.
They're both artist types.
He wanted to work it out with me first.
I was either going to be an asparagus or a Brussels sprout.
But I was pushing for the asparagus, so... so I wouldn't lose the phallic thing.
Right.
Got it.
Okay.
But the overall deal would be if Joe rejoins the group, you would be getting a pay cut.
Oh, I was never in it for the money.
Why, because your daddy's rich?
No.
Because of the moms.
I was in it for them.
The moms...?
Joe cleaned up for years.
A few moms would slip him their phone numbers after every show.
Then, when I got into the carrot suit, it worked for me, too.
That's why I wanted to be an asparagus.
Right.
Okay.
When was the last time you saw Joe?
A week ago Tuesday.
I was supposed to meet up with him after the show to talk through some concepts, but he never showed up.
Right, let me guess... uh, no one knew that you were going to meet Joe.
Well, yeah, of course.
Look-look, like I said,
Joe wanted this to be just between us until we worked out all the details.
So you don't have an alibi the day that Joe disappeared.
I didn't kill Joe.
Okay?
You...
you have to believe me.
I'm just trying to get the facts here, Mr. Carrot, and it's not looking too good for you.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT:
We're ready!
We need the carrot!
Hey.
I found traces of castoreum, ambergris, musk... which is perfume.
I also found tartrazine and glycol distearate, which is found in lipstick.
Oh.
Well, that makes sense.
Apparently, he slept with a lot of women.
Listen, honey, um... we have a problem.
What?
Clark's book.
We have to be honest with him.
I mean, nobody is ever gonna publish it.
Well, it's not up to us, Angie.
We don't have a choice.
He asked to see us so that we could talk about the book.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
After we finish the case.
I don't suppose it's ethical to take a lot more time to catch a killer.
We're his friends.
I...
I just think we should be straight with him.
Man...
I hate it when you act like an adult.
What'd you find?
Dr. Brennan told me to take another look at the fractures on the body of the sternum.
Another fight?
No, these are three months before the fight.
I've heard of people hating their vegetables before, but this was one despised carrot.
These injuries weren't from a fight.
The fracturing to the ribs and sternum, these fractures run laterally, caused by repeated forceful compression of the rib cage.
CPR?
Almost certainly.
So he might have had a heart attack five months ago.
And if he still had a heart condition, it would explain him dropping without breaking his fall.
But it wouldn't explain why someone would dump him into a pile of kudzu.
Starkel was admitted to Mountview General two years ago, with a rare heart condition called Long QT Syndrome.
Sounds like a dude ranch.
It's a condition which increases the risk of episodes of torsades de pointes.
Wow.
What's that?
It's potentially fatal arrhythmia provoked by various stimuli.
Like what?
Anything that could startle you-- a loud noise or a sudden shock.
That's a hell of a way to go through life.
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.
Well, beta blockers are used to treat the condition quite effectively.
All right, then what killed him?
He wasn't taking his medication.
Cam's tox screen came back negative for all drugs, even the beta blockers.
Why would a guy with a deadly condition not take his medication?
Men have been known to stop taking beta blockers because of a strong...
side effect.
Oh.
Impotence.
Munson said that Starkel was sleeping around.
So obviously, I guess he decided that sex was more important than staying alive.
Someone could have known his condition and figured it was a perfect way to kill him.
Oh, wow, that is just cold.
Oh, oh, oh, I...
oh, I almost forgot.
I almost forgot.
I set up the whole, uh, one man band ready to go for Christine's birthday party.
He's going to kill it!
(imitates drums, horn)
I was thinking, Booth...
Since we'll be in the park,
I thought we could play tag.
Sure.
Tag is fun.
See, you know how to have fun.
You're not gonna catch me, though.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.
I am quite good at tag.
Come on.
I used to be a Ranger, okay?
You're never gonna catch me.
We'll see.
HODGINS:
Hey.
So I found duck poo, pig bristle and goat hairs in the kudzu run-off.
Why do you get to have all the fun?
The animal particles, as well as everything else we found, suggest that Starkel could have been killed in a parking lot near a farm.
But there are no farms close to where the body was dumped.
What are you up to?
Well, I decided to search
Starkel's credit card charges, to see if it's possible to track his movements on the day he died.
Nailed it, I'm sure.
Well, no.
He didn't charge anything that day.
But it did give me an idea.
I expanded the search to include all of Starkel's credit card activity over the past two months, right?
Then I cross-referenced those charges against the credit card activity of all of our suspects.
I have married Big Brother.
Interesting result.
Credit card and debit card purchases of the victim and of Marilyn Starkel intersect several times.
Look.
Joe Starkel rents a room at the Tidefront Motel.
And here
Marilyn buys gas the following morning, next-door.
Okay.
Here's another one.
A hotel stay on Joe's card.
And then a trip to the closest drug store by Marilyn that same night.
Now, these two don't live anywhere near each other.
So, Carrot Bill is having an affair with his brother's wife.
And his brother would definitely know about his heart condition.
We talked to your wife, okay?
She claims that you knew, okay?
That she was having an affair with your brother.
Marilyn and I are both artists, Agent Booth.
We believe in letting our creative side out to play.
"Letting your creative side out to play."
What does that have to do with anything?
She was following her feelings, which I support.
We have an open relationship.
You have an open relationship?
Really?
That's really convenient for you to say right now.
The fact is that you knew that your brother had a medical condition, so you thought you could scare him so you can get away with murder.
I couldn't do that even if I wanted to.
Joe was on medication.
He had it under control.
You're saying you didn't know that your brother stopped taking the beta blockers?
That's-that's crazy.
Why would he do that?
So he could sleep with your wife.
Look...
look, I loved Joe.
He was my brother.
I would never kill him.
Brothers kill brothers all the time, Ken.
Booth wants anything that could possibly link
Joe's brother to the murder.
Well, Hodgins might be leading us there.
With ducks and pigs?
Well, particulates from an Ancona duck,
Nigerian dwarf goat or a pot-bellied pig, to be exact.
MONTENEGRO:
But there are 322 farms and petting zoos and veterinary clinics in the area, which might have those breeds.
Well, Booth is not going to 322 farms.
Which is why I found a way to narrow it down even further.
Check this out.
Charlie's Barnyard.
The children's television show?
Now, look at the location.
HODGINS:
See, the animals are kept in pens next to the parking lot at the same studios the Veg-Ta-Bills use.
Where his brother works.
There's oil spots all over in all these places.
I hope your little magic stick can find out where he was killed.
It's not a magic stick, Booth.
It's an alternative light source.
Okay, well, we need a little magic right now.
Found something.
Okay, what do we got?
This is definitely blood.
Well, the angle matches the fracture on the victim's parietal.
This where he fell and conked his head.
Yeah, and there's more blood here.
BOOTH:
Oh!
We got a trail.
BRENNAN:
And it keeps going.
And it stops here.
Look at that.
Right up to the skid marks.
So, he was hit there;
his body was dragged here, up to these skid marks, which are...
(chuckles) tires marks of a smaller car.
Well, we can match these tires to the ones found
(phone ringing) at the scene of the body dump.
Dr. Saroyan.
I don't think it's the brother.
I found a compound of propylene glycol, glyceryl stearate and hydrolyzed lupine protein from the kudzu runoff.
Those are cosmetic ingredients.
You already found those.
No, these are different.
And the concentrations are extremely high.
There's no way that Starkel got that much on him from being with one woman.
HODGINS:
I ran the compound through an FDA database.
Turns out that it's unique to a moisturizer made by a Suzy James Cosmetics.
Wait a second, that's the company that Debra Ann Volker works for.
I already told you.
I respected Mr. Starkel.
I was grateful to him.
I'd never hurt him.
You didn't mean to.
He had a heart condition you couldn't have known about.
But he was so healthy.
No, he wasn't.
And the trunk of your car has Starkel's DNA and blood.
BRENNAN:
As well as cosmetics that were found on his clothing.
Plus your tires match the tires that were found at the site where the body was dumped.
(voice breaking):
He slept with so many women.
Why not me?
And you just, what, you wanted to get close to him?
I-I drove up behind him.
And I have an electric car, so I guess he didn't, he didn't hear me.
And I got right up to him, you know?
I just wanted to surprise him.
So I honked my horn.
You startled him.
But he just dropped.
And-and-and he hit his head on-on the parking block.
So I got out and I-I ran to him and I tried to help him.
But... he was just...
I...
I just wanted to get his attention, okay?
I-I just wanted him to see how good I look.
'Cause that was all because of him.
He died the instant you honked your horn.
So you put him in your car and you dumped his body.
You dumped his body.
I didn't know what else to do.
I didn't want anybody to think it was my fault.
But it was, Debra.

Ah, since the case is over, Dr. Saroyan, I thought it be okay for us to share a little wine.
Certainly make our conversation a lot easier.
I agree.
Okay, if we run out,
I have more in my office.
Really?
Yeah.
Doing what we do,
I'm surprised we all don't.
Please, sit.
O-Okay.
(clears throat)
(sighs)
(exhales) So, you-you want to... uh, to talk, um, about your book.
Yes.
I can't tell you how much it's meant to me that you guys all read my book.
As your friends, we-we want to be honest with you.
Of course.
But, uh, first, I would like if we could all raise our paper cups.
I can't imagine a more wonderful group of friends to share this good news with.
I'm being published.
What?
The same publishers who published Dr. Brennan.
They think my book is perfect for them.
They're promising a big release.
We-we... we should drink!
To-to Murder Made Me Do It.
Down the old hatch.
Now, look, I-I know that I'm published now, but I would really still like your feedback.
So, uh...
MONTENEGRO:
Well, I... for one, I-I loved it.
SAROYAN:
Me, too.
This is... the best book I've read in a long time.
It was riveting.
I gotta tell you,
I can't believe you all loved it.
I know.
Neither can I.
Published.
Yeah.
BRENNAN (laughing):
Oh, no.
Hello.
Hey.
Where's Booth?
Oh, he's dealing with Ronnie the one-man band.
(drumming, clanging)
Bones.
Bones!
Bones, Bones, Bones!
Come here, come here.
(squeaking)
Why are you wearing that?
What do you mean?
Well, Ronnie, Ronnie.
Look at him.
He's passed out, and I don't want him drooling all over the kids.
Well, you can't play that.
What-what do you mean I can't?
What?
You just do this.
(cymbal clangs)
One of these.
(plays accordion, squeaks)
And Pops, you know, he taught me how to play the harmonica.
Listen.
(plays harmonica)
(chuckles) Right?
(plays accordion)
Right.
So come on.
Help me in the back.
Make sure everything's all hooked up.
(plays accordion)
Christine is happy just playing with her friends, Booth.
Look, all right, I don't want to disappoint Christine.
I promised my little girl that I would get her the one-man band.
(plays accordion) And that's what she's gonna get.
(plays harmonica) Okay.
(Booth playing lively song) What's happening?
(applause, cheering)
Hey!
ALL: ♪ Happy birthday ♪

(clanging, squeaking)
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

BOOTH:
No, no.
Let-let me just finish here, honey, okay?
No, Mommy said tag.
You're not afraid, are you?
I'm kind of at a disadvantage here.
Okay.
And Mommy always won.
Want to go?
I told her it was my favorite game.
Tag, you're it!
Tag, tag, tag!
(drum thumping)
Tempe always won.
Go get 'em!
Go get 'em!
(cheering, whooping)
(horn honking)
(laughing)
Oh, no!
Don't get me!
Oh, did he get you?
(laughing, yelling happily)
Oh, you got me!
I'm It!
(laughs)
Oh, I'm at a serious disadvantage here, Bones.
Well, that's because you're playing me.
Ah!
Ha-ha!
You're It!
Fade to the left!
Go!
MONTENEGRO:
Get him!
Get him!
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
What's that mean?
[]I got it, why don't we rent a bouncy house for Christine's birthday party?
She'll love that.
Kids love to bounce up and down.
A recent study showed that over the past 10 years, approximately 65,000 children were treated for injuries received on bouncy houses.
Listen, you've already put the kibosh on the kickball party, the glow-stick party and the reptile guy.
Who doesn't like reptiles?
I don't see why she needs a party.
Kids just get cake all over themselves and fight over toy[.
They're little kids;
what could be better?
I mean, don't you remember your birthday party (sighs) when you were a little girl?
I never had one.
What?
!
Wait a second, you-you never had a birthday party?
That is correct and I didn't miss anything.
Okay.
Christine is dressed.
I'll drop her off at preschool on my way to the market.
Thanks, Dad.
Uh, no party, huh?
What?
Booth thinks I was deprived, because you never gave me any birthday parties as a child.
Well, you didn't have birthday parties, because that would draw attention to us and with the police looking for us, that's not a good thing.
Right.
Unbelievable.
I forgot-- fugitive.
Listen, if I had it to do over again, you would have birthday parties, but I ca-- I-I can't turn the clock back.
He's right, Booth;
the arrow of time--
(phone ringing)
Brennan.
Oh, okay.
It's coming into the lab?
Dot touch it until I get there.
(phone beeps)
Dad's taking my car.
I need a ride to the lab.
Remains are coming in.
Sure.
I got you.
No party, huh?
W-W-What do you want me to do?
Make a balloon animal for her now?
A book?
!
Yeah. 364 pages.
I never thought I could do it.
And it's a mystery?
Yeah.
Like Dr. B writes?
Yeah.
Same genre.
You know, write what you know.
Wow.
(laughs):
Oh...
The victim is in there?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, that, is awesome.
Wow, it's like the root system is pulling apart the bones.
And there's very little tissue remaining, but there should be enough for a tox screen.
I thought Dr. Brennan said not to touch it.
But... since you're the boss, it doesn't really matter what she wants.
HODGINS:
Kudzu.
Hey, man, this stuff grows about a foot a day, so I should be able to tell how long the victim's been in here.
There's staining and pitting on the bones.
HODGINS:
Yeah.
Kudzu excretes isoflavone aglycones to break down the surface of the bone so the roots can attach.
Hmm.
(leaves rustling)
What was that?
It's still growing.
It's feeding off the remaining tissue.
I've seen this movie.
It doesn't end well for humanity.
(leaves rustling)
Look, you shouldn't be upset with Max is Dr. Brennan isn't...
Oh, God.
It's encased.
It's like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
Yeah.
The squints are going to have a field day with that.
But when you're a little girl, you should be treated like a princess, not some criminal on the run.
Max was a criminal on the run, so Dr. Brennan's probably just sublimated those feelings as a way to cope.
And now she's just trying to justify it all by saying that a kid's birthday party isn't important.
But it is.
I would imagine so.
I've never been thrown a party either, so...
You too?
No.
Wow.
Yeah.
My dad was a drunk, and he threw me a birthday party every year.
The only time I ever saw him really sober.
It's probably why birthdays are so meaningful to you.
Tell you what, why don't you just, you know, shrink the photos.
Just focus on what you do best and I'll get the techs to go out to the crime scene and see if they can find any, uh, tire tracks and footprints.
When we get time of death, we might be able to match them up.
Okay.
MONTENEGRO:
Okay, this plant is covering too much of the skull for me to do a reconstruction.
Are you going to be able to remove the vegetation without compromising the remains, Dr. Hodgins?
Sort of my thing.
The size of the second cervical vertebra indicates the victim was male.
Animal predation appears to account for most of the tissue loss.
Yeah, the kudzu fed on the rest.
Guys, I, I don't even see the skull.
He's peeking through here, like an apparition appearing through a leafy fog.
I beg your pardon, Dr. Edison?
HODGINS:
Clark just finished writing a book.
It's a mystery, so you better watch out, Dr. B.
Why?
I doubt it will impact my sales.
Good for you, Clark.
I wouldn't have thought of you as a writer.
Well, after Nora and I broke up, I had a lot of free time.
I found, in the evenings, the words just poured out, so...
Your time is not free now, Dr. Edison.
Why are you even here, rather than an intern?
Forensic conference in Buffalo.
The interns got extra credit if they went.
Yeah, well, everyone should get extra credit for going to Buffalo.
Okay, then.
Which I will interpret as, "Welcome aboard."
Thank you.
The angular eye orbit indicates the victim is Caucasian.
The root system seems to have snaked its way through every opening.
(leaves rustling)
We need to remove the skull before it's damaged.
No problem.
Severing the roots around the orifices loosens the kudzu's hold.
See that?
SAROYAN:
Delicate work.
Yeah.
Very.
Hey, so are you going to do Christine's birthday party at the house, Dr. B?
Please concentrate, Dr. Hodgins.
HODGINS:
Ye of little faith.
The skull is free.
(leaves rustling)
Oh!
That is why I put no stock in faith!

[]The root system has crushed the bones, Dr. Hodgins.
Yeah, and it is still growing.
Well, it might stop, if we can get out the remaining tissue and organs that it's feeding on.
I'm cutting as fast as I can, but the backseat driving isn't helping.
Dr. Edison is going to have a very difficult time reassembling the remains.
I've already asked for help from my department.
Here you go.
Ah, a portion of the liver.
The kudzu seemed to love it.
The roots have grown through the endosteum.
I don't even know what this is.
His prostate.
And it's still relatively intact.
It is always the last organ to go.
Does that mean that you can determine time of death?
Well, if the body's been outside since death, decomp would indicate at least six days.
Well, given the rate of growth of the kudzu, I'd say nine.
Eight?
Yeah.
Deal.
I'm gonna run this tissue for DNA and run a tox screen.
According to these pictures, looks like he pulled right up the embankment, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, and look, there are no footprints between where the car pulled up and where the body was found.
So, what-what, he got out of his car, right?
His feet didn't leave the asphalt, probably because he was afraid he was gonna be seen and he dumps the body as quickly as possible.
We're dealing with an amateur here.
He would have picked a more secluded spot.
Chances are, the killer was horrified by what he did.
Yeah.
Mm.
So you gonna... you gonna let Dr. Brennan help plan the party?
(tapping on table)
I will.
It would make her feel like a princess if she did.
(groans quietly)
Right.
That didn't go over well.
Here are a few more clean bones for you.
Oh, thank you.
These clean bones are really making reconstruction a lot easier.
So far, I know that the victim suffered sharp force trauma to the parietal;
the cross-shaped fractures indicative of someone that was struck from the left with a hard-shaped object.
So, a fight with a lefty before he was killed?
Yeah.
Looks that way.
You know, this might end up being a very exciting case.
Perhaps it was about love, or money, or love and money, or--
Easy does it there, Mr. Dickens.
Sure.
You know, I would love for you to read what I just finished.
I mean, I've already submitted to a publisher, but of course, I can make changes.
Yeah.
Sure.
BOOTH:
DNA said the victim is Joe Starkel.
So the victim's brother works for Merryvale Productions-- they make TV shows.
Apparently, the victim used to work there too.
What about a storyteller for the children?
I have the number of an excellent one to call.
That sounds promising.
I know!
Yeah.
He tells environmental tales about species who are dying on the Great Barrier Reef.
What?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
That sounds awful.
It's educational and poignant.
What's awful about that?
The words
"educational" and "poignant."
Just leave it to me, Bones.
I'm going for fun and more fun.
A lot of fun.
Trust me.
Mr. Starkel and the other performers are about to start shooting a scene.
He's the actor in green.
Thanks.

3.8 grams, as well as 20 percent of her vitamin A requirements.
Not to mention, an abundance of--
These are the Veg-Ta-Bills.
They're vegetables that are all named "Bill."

That was great.
It was great, great.
Carrots, corn and broccoli-- my man.
Who are you?
We're with the FBI.
Show him your badge.
Bones, wait till we...
We're here to inform you that your brother has been murdered.
And that corn is not a vegetable.
Oh, my God.
I'm just talking... []I can't believe Joe is dead.
Do you know how it happened?
We don't know all the details yet.
He was discovered being devoured by a patch of kudzu along the side of State Route 32.
Really?
What?
You don't follow the...?
Oh, God!
This is awful.
Can you think of anyone who'd want to hurt your brother?
No.
He was a wonderful guy.
He was the best man at our wedding.
Wait a second-- if your brother was Carrot Bill, who-who's that?
That's Tommy.
When Joe left, we had to find a replacement.
If Joe created the show, why did he leave?
He was working on developing a new show--
Mirthquake Village.
So you weren't upset that your brother left?
Sure-Sure, I was, at first.
They're brothers.
Brothers fight, right?
When was the last time either one of you saw him?
It's been a couple months.
He's pretty busy with his new show.
Look, we may have some more questions for you.
If you're thinking about leaving town,
I suggest you call that number first-- that's me.
Okay.
You have something for me, Dr. Edison?
Yes.
I would like you to read my book.
Dr. Hodgins is, and I would, uh, like to give you the chance as well.
You know what?
I am very busy.
Wouldn't Dr. Brennan be a better judge of your work?
I mean, she's a writer, too.
Mm, I'd rather get feedback from readers.
After all, that's who I wrote it for.
We should probably finish the case first, and then I'll try to get to it.
Great.
Now speaking of which,
I found remodeled fractures on the radius and ulna of both arms as well as the right fifth and eighth ribs.
Remodeling suggests that it was sustained about eight weeks ago.
A fight?
Yes.
His brother said everybody loved Joe.
I guess that wasn't the case.
Anything on cause of death yet?
No, not yet.
Okay.
Dr. Saroyan... you... forgot my book.
I look forward to your thoughts.
Of course.
Okay, check this out.
I found the perfect thing for Christine's birthday party.
Ronnie the One-Man Band?
Yes!
The one-man band!
Show me one person that doesn't like a one-man band.
I'm sure many don't like them, which is why they're such a rarity.
Help me out here, Sweets.
You like the one-man band?
I think this is really between the two of you.
Come on.
You know how hard Christine laughs when she watches Mary Poppins and Dick Van Dyke, you know, doing the one-man band.
(mimics percussion)
That is true.
True.
(text alert sounds)
Oh, you got a text here from Cam.
"Joe Starkel was in a serious fight about eight weeks ago."
That's when he was doing his new show.
Maybe someone on that show knows who fought with him.
Hold on a minute.
You're saying
Joe Starkel is dead?
Well, he got into a fight a few months ago, when he was working here.
Do you know anything about that?
No.
Uh, he was pretty irritable, though, because Mirthquake Village didn't turn out to be very good.
Look, I told Joe, real nice,
I was pulling the plug.
It's tough for a one-hit wonder to accept the truth, you know what I mean?
Jake, we need to talk.
I'm a little busy.
These nice people are with the FBI.
It'll just be a minute.
My character would never wear a crocodile belt.
Why the hell not?
You're a crocodile cowboy.
It's sick, a croc wearing croc.
Would you wear a human belt?
I agree with the crocodile.
Okay, Bones, that's enough.
Listen, you wouldn't happen to know a Joe Starkel?
Oh.
Oh, is that what this is about?
Yeah.
Is he finally filing charges, Jake?
Wear whatever the hell you want.
Just let me finish up here.
I'm sorry.
Charges?
What charges?
I don't know what he's babbling about.
CROCODILE COWBOY:
Well, it's no great secret, Jake.
Jake here and Joe, they got into it when Jake pulled the plug on Mirthquake.
Really?
A little tiff.
BRENNAN:
His injuries were extensive.
You fractured his ribs, mandible, zygomatic.
Funny how that slipped your mind.
Joe started it.
He freaked when
I told him I didn't want to do his show.
He came at me swinging.
I defended myself.
I was standing my ground.
SAROYAN:
So, how's it coming?
Actually, the detergent I used to loosen the vines from the bones cleaned off a ton of very interesting stuff.
And what did you find?
Well, so far, I found some motor oil that was on the victim.
And I'll try to match that to a specific car.
I also found a mixture of limestone, clay, fly ash, and gypsum.
Oh, uh, Portland cement.
It's my job to determine that, but you are absolutely right.
And I'm thoroughly impressed.
So what does it mean?
I'm not sure yet.
Could be a construction site.
But I believe the answer is in the runoff.
Have you, uh, started the book yet?
No.
I am so nervous.
I mean, what if it stinks?
But it could be great, right?
MONTENEGRO I just found out that the producer Starkel fought with was out of the country when he was killed.
But I think that I have a new suspect.
So, this is Carrot Bill's Twitter account.
SWEETS:
You mean Joe Starkel.
No.
This is the carrot's.
You'd be surprised about how many adult fans there are of the show.
Like this woman, Debra Ann Volker.
Her Twitter handle is SuperVeggieFanXOXO.
Carrot Bill was blocking her direct messages.
"I rely on you to guide my life.
"I trust in you.
Everything I am is because of you."
Okay, this is a woman that's showing signs of being obsessed.
Well, that's just the beginning.
Flash forward to just after Starkel left the Veg-Ta-Bills.
"I gave you everything.
You let me down.
"You will rot in hell, and I will make it happen." Wow.
She sent over 50 tweets in a 48-hour period, and this was the week before Starkel was killed.
Look at this picture she posted.
What, she Photoshopped herself into that?
It's crazy, right?
Uh, a grown woman obsessed with a giant orange phallic symbol?
Yeah, I'm comfortable calling her crazy.
[]VOLKER:
Carrot Bill dead?
I can't believe it.
He was the best vegetable.
Okay, you do realize that Carrot Bill is a fictional character?
Joe Starkel is the man that died.
I know.
I'm not insane, Dr. Sweets.
Shrinks always look for the crazy in everything.
I watch the Veg-Ta-Bills with my six-year-old son.
To him, the carrot is real.
Right.
Did you send these to Joe Starkel?
I'm kind of a Twitter freak, I guess.
That's a bit of an understatement.
Uh, "I want to peel you out of your carrot suit and eat you raw." Okay, okay, my son wasn't the only one who liked the show.
But you know what happens online.
You're anonymous, so you say things that you wouldn't face-to-face, right?
There are hundreds of these messages.
I mean, it starts with autograph requests and it moves on to wanting to meet, and then the stuff about eating his carrot.
I mean, that's-that's, cyberstalking, Ms. Volker.
Maybe I went a little overboard, but that show changed my life as much as my son's.
I was overweight, eating junk,
I had high blood pressure, and-and sleep apnea... but because of Carrot Bill,
I went from this, to what you see now.
He saved my life and my career.
I sell beauty products, which is very hard to do when you're 80 pounds overweight.
That is quite a change.
Well, I was terrified of putting this weight back on when he left the show.
So you saw the group as kind of a talisman for your good fortune then.
I've always been a little superstitious, I guess.
Have you always threatened people?
Why would I kill him?
Why?
He changed my life.
How are you doing with Joe Starkel's e-mails?
He deleted most of them using a multi-pass system used by the DoD.
Sounds like he was hiding something.
I guess we'll never know.
Well, maybe not.
I might be able to use a magnetic force microscopy to recover film fragments and piece them together.
Did you get anything else from the tox screens?
Nope.
He was one clean-living carrot.
Clark's book?
I only got through two chapters.
Pretty painful stuff.
Two pages of the sun setting over the remains of an itinerant stock broker.
So I found traces of asphalt with the concrete and oil.
I think the injuries might have taken place in a parking lot.
MONTENEGRO:
Oh, great.
So that narrows down the murder site to, like, a million places.
HODGINS:
Wow.
Snarky.
Oh, the book got you down?
Ooh... (clears throat)
"Death had never looked so dead as the death
"now in front of them,
"all life drained, only death covering the dead."
You think the victim was dead?
Please, I couldn't even get past chapter one.
Remember this?
"McDonald's farm was nestled in a glen, perfect for the final days of an old man."
Old McDonald had a farm?
Really?
Seriously?
What are we gonna tell him?
We're gonna tell him the truth.
That I've never read anything like it.
MONTENEGRO:
Oh, that's good.
Yeah.
It's, uh, one of a kind.
HODGINS:
Absolutely.
What's one of a kind?
Oh, uh, your book.
I've never read anything like it.
HODGINS:
Yeah, yeah.
You know, I've been very busy with the case, so I've only gotten through chapter one, but so far, it is just... (laughs) I mean...
Whew!
Well, you know, my feeling is, if the writer doesn't hook a reader in chapter one, he's not doing his job.
Look, I just don't want compliments.
I can take criticism.
Of-Of course.
Sure.
You-you got it.
Okay, great.
Now, um... oh.
I found some additional remodeled injuries, uh, this time to the sternum and lower ribs.
More recent than from the fight with the producer.
You know,
I hope we solve this soon so you can all finish reading.
Me, too.
Can't wait!
Chapter two awaits.
Right, right.
(laughs)
MAX:
It's so nice to have coffee with you.
We never to do this.
BRENNAN:
I know.
(Max sighs happily)
But something tells me this is about more than coffee.
It's Christine's party.
Booth is taking care of it and that makes me uncomfortable, because I have no frame of reference for an important event in my daughter's life.
Oh, honey... it wasn't that bad.
I mean, your mother and I did all we could.
You could have lived an honest life, Dad.
You know, sometimes circumstances move your life in a direction you never thought it would go.
What are you implying?
Well, your mother and I, we never intended to live outside the law.
I don't understand.
Then why did you?
I can't tell you why.
Not yet.
Certain people are out there... still alive... could get hurt.
And after all I've done,
I don't want to hurt anyone else.
That's not a real answer.
I...
I know, but you're just going to have to trust me.
It's not easy, Dad.
I'm sure it isn't.
But when all is said and done, honey, your childhood wasn't so bad.
You used to love playing tag when you were a kid.
Think back.
Come on.
You loved it.
And you... and you always got me.
(laughs)
I mean, you could... you-you would fade to your right and then, suddenly, you would slash through to your left...
Y-You could've played football.
I can still hear you laughing and squealing with joy every time you got me.
Isn't that reference enough for you to... to give Christine a good birthday?
BOOTH:
So what is the verdict?
Okay?
Is Debra Ann Volker capable of murder?
Well, she definitely suffers from celebrity worship syndrome.
Celebrity worship syndrome?
What is that?
Is that even a real thing?
Yeah.
It's an obsessive-addictive disorder.
I'll get you the literature on it, if you want.
Nah, I'll take your word for it.
So is she a killer?
Volker's tweets definitely place her at the borderline of pathological behavior.
And since there's no cause of death, we have nothing to link her, except that she's a wacko.
Well, wackos are kind of my thing.
Yeah, well, evidence is my thing, Sweets.
You know that. (phone ringing)
Hold on.
Ooh!
It's Ronnie!
Who's Ronnie?
Hey!
Ronnie!
Yeah!
Who's Ronnie?
Thanks, bud, for getting back to me.
He's a one-man-band.
Oh...
Okay.
Now?
Great.
He's going to play a song for us.
Now?
Yeah, li... (whimsical music playing) Huh?
It's pretty cool.
Right?
(laughs)
This guy's a genius.
The fractures to the body of the sternum, the xiphoid process and the surrounding ribs appear to be related to chest compressions.
CLARK:
Which were sustained about five months ago.
Now, what's odd is that for someone who appears to have been assaulted at time of death, there are no Colles fractures to the distal radius, or humeral head breaks.
Which suggests the victim didn't try to break his fall.
Hmm.
Because he lost consciousness.
But none of the injuries he sustained would have be enough to render him unconscious.
Yeah, and Dr. Saroyan said his tox screens came back clear, so no drugs or alcohol.
Which means there's a cause we're not seeing.
And that calls for imagination.
Well, it's what we writers do, isn't it?
But scientists require facts, not flights of fancy.
True.
Of course.
Congratulations on finishing your novel, Clark.
I know what an achievement that is.
Thank you, Dr. Brennan.
Booth.
MONTENEGRO:
I reconstructed Joe Starkel's deleted e-mails.
Apparently, he wanted to be Carrot Bill again.
His brother never mentioned anything about that.
Well, these weren't to his brother.
They were to the head of the company that produced the Veg-Ta-Bills, Henry Munson.
"Munson"?
Whoa, wait a second.
The new Carrot Bill is Tommy Munson.
I know.
Tommy is Henry Munson's son.
[]Look, I didn't have any problems with Joe.
He was a great guy.
No?
No problems at all?
Okay, Daddy didn't tell you that Joe wanted his job back?
Yeah.
Sure he did.
What about it?
Okay, and that didn't make you upset, that you were probably going to be replaced?
That's what I thought at first.
But then Joe called me and told me he was coming up with a whole new character for me.
Wait a second-
- Joe called you, not his brother?
Yeah, he and his brother fought all the time.
They're both artist types.
He wanted to work it out with me first.
I was either going to be an asparagus or a Brussels sprout.
But I was pushing for the asparagus, so... so I wouldn't lose the phallic thing.
Right.
Got it.
Okay.
But the overall deal would be if Joe rejoins the group, you would be getting a pay cut.
Oh, I was never in it for the money.
Why, because your daddy's rich?
No.
Because of the moms.
I was in it for them.
The moms...?
Joe cleaned up for years.
A few moms would slip him their phone numbers after every show.
Then, when I got into the carrot suit, it worked for me, too.
That's why I wanted to be an asparagus.
Right.
Okay.
When was the last time you saw Joe?
A week ago Tuesday.
I was supposed to meet up with him after the show to talk through some concepts, but he never showed up.
Right, let me guess... uh, no one knew that you were going to meet Joe.
Well, yeah, of course.
Look-look, like I said,
Joe wanted this to be just between us until we worked out all the details.
So you don't have an alibi the day that Joe disappeared.
I didn't kill Joe.
Okay?
You...
you have to believe me.
I'm just trying to get the facts here, Mr. Carrot, and it's not looking too good for you.
PRODUCTION ASSISTANT:
We're ready!
We need the carrot!
Hey.
I found traces of castoreum, ambergris, musk... which is perfume.
I also found tartrazine and glycol distearate, which is found in lipstick.
Oh.
Well, that makes sense.
Apparently, he slept with a lot of women.
Listen, honey, um... we have a problem.
What?
Clark's book.
We have to be honest with him.
I mean, nobody is ever gonna publish it.
Well, it's not up to us, Angie.
We don't have a choice.
He asked to see us so that we could talk about the book.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
After we finish the case.
I don't suppose it's ethical to take a lot more time to catch a killer.
We're his friends.
I...
I just think we should be straight with him.
Man...
I hate it when you act like an adult.
What'd you find?
Dr. Brennan told me to take another look at the fractures on the body of the sternum.
Another fight?
No, these are three months before the fight.
I've heard of people hating their vegetables before, but this was one despised carrot.
These injuries weren't from a fight.
The fracturing to the ribs and sternum, these fractures run laterally, caused by repeated forceful compression of the rib cage.
CPR?
Almost certainly.
So he might have had a heart attack five months ago.
And if he still had a heart condition, it would explain him dropping without breaking his fall.
But it wouldn't explain why someone would dump him into a pile of kudzu.
Starkel was admitted to Mountview General two years ago, with a rare heart condition called Long QT Syndrome.
Sounds like a dude ranch.
It's a condition which increases the risk of episodes of torsades de pointes.
Wow.
What's that?
It's potentially fatal arrhythmia provoked by various stimuli.
Like what?
Anything that could startle you-- a loud noise or a sudden shock.
That's a hell of a way to go through life.
I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did.
Well, beta blockers are used to treat the condition quite effectively.
All right, then what killed him?
He wasn't taking his medication.
Cam's tox screen came back negative for all drugs, even the beta blockers.
Why would a guy with a deadly condition not take his medication?
Men have been known to stop taking beta blockers because of a strong...
side effect.
Oh.
Impotence.
Munson said that Starkel was sleeping around.
So obviously, I guess he decided that sex was more important than staying alive.
Someone could have known his condition and figured it was a perfect way to kill him.
Oh, wow, that is just cold.
Oh, oh, oh, I...
oh, I almost forgot.
I almost forgot.
I set up the whole, uh, one man band ready to go for Christine's birthday party.
He's going to kill it!
(imitates drums, horn)
I was thinking, Booth...
Since we'll be in the park,
I thought we could play tag.
Sure.
Tag is fun.
See, you know how to have fun.
You're not gonna catch me, though.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.
I am quite good at tag.
Come on.
I used to be a Ranger, okay?
You're never gonna catch me.
We'll see.
HODGINS:
Hey.
So I found duck poo, pig bristle and goat hairs in the kudzu run-off.
Why do you get to have all the fun?
The animal particles, as well as everything else we found, suggest that Starkel could have been killed in a parking lot near a farm.
But there are no farms close to where the body was dumped.
What are you up to?
Well, I decided to search
Starkel's credit card charges, to see if it's possible to track his movements on the day he died.
Nailed it, I'm sure.
Well, no.
He didn't charge anything that day.
But it did give me an idea.
I expanded the search to include all of Starkel's credit card activity over the past two months, right?
Then I cross-referenced those charges against the credit card activity of all of our suspects.
I have married Big Brother.
Interesting result.
Credit card and debit card purchases of the victim and of Marilyn Starkel intersect several times.
Look.
Joe Starkel rents a room at the Tidefront Motel.
And here
Marilyn buys gas the following morning, next-door.
Okay.
Here's another one.
A hotel stay on Joe's card.
And then a trip to the closest drug store by Marilyn that same night.
Now, these two don't live anywhere near each other.
So, Carrot Bill is having an affair with his brother's wife.
And his brother would definitely know about his heart condition.
[]We talked to your wife, okay?
She claims that you knew, okay?
That she was having an affair with your brother.
Marilyn and I are both artists, Agent Booth.
We believe in letting our creative side out to play.
"Letting your creative side out to play."
What does that have to do with anything?
She was following her feelings, which I support.
We have an open relationship.
You have an open relationship?
Really?
That's really convenient for you to say right now.
The fact is that you knew that your brother had a medical condition, so you thought you could scare him so you can get away with murder.
I couldn't do that even if I wanted to.
Joe was on medication.
He had it under control.
You're saying you didn't know that your brother stopped taking the beta blockers?
That's-that's crazy.
Why would he do that?
So he could sleep with your wife.
Look...
look, I loved Joe.
He was my brother.
I would never kill him.
Brothers kill brothers all the time, Ken.
Booth wants anything that could possibly link
Joe's brother to the murder.
Well, Hodgins might be leading us there.
With ducks and pigs?
Well, particulates from an Ancona duck,
Nigerian dwarf goat or a pot-bellied pig, to be exact.
MONTENEGRO:
But there are 322 farms and petting zoos and veterinary clinics in the area, which might have those breeds.
Well, Booth is not going to 322 farms.
Which is why I found a way to narrow it down even further.
Check this out.
Charlie's Barnyard.
The children's television show?
Now, look at the location.
HODGINS:
See, the animals are kept in pens next to the parking lot at the same studios the Veg-Ta-Bills use.
Where his brother works.
There's oil spots all over in all these places.
I hope your little magic stick can find out where he was killed.
It's not a magic stick, Booth.
It's an alternative light source.
Okay, well, we need a little magic right now.
Found something.
Okay, what do we got?
This is definitely blood.
Well, the angle matches the fracture on the victim's parietal.
This where he fell and conked his head.
Yeah, and there's more blood here.
BOOTH:
Oh!
We got a trail.
BRENNAN:
And it keeps going.
And it stops here.
Look at that.
Right up to the skid marks.
So, he was hit there;
his body was dragged here, up to these skid marks, which are...
(chuckles) tires marks of a smaller car.
Well, we can match these tires to the ones found
(phone ringing) at the scene of the body dump.
Dr. Saroyan.
I don't think it's the brother.
I found a compound of propylene glycol, glyceryl stearate and hydrolyzed lupine protein from the kudzu runoff.
Those are cosmetic ingredients.
You already found those.
No, these are different.
And the concentrations are extremely high.
There's no way that Starkel got that much on him from being with one woman.
HODGINS:
I ran the compound through an FDA database.
Turns out that it's unique to a moisturizer made by a Suzy James Cosmetics.
Wait a second, that's the company that Debra Ann Volker works for.
I already told you.
I respected Mr. Starkel.
I was grateful to him.
I'd never hurt him.
You didn't mean to.
He had a heart condition you couldn't have known about.
But he was so healthy.
No, he wasn't.
And the trunk of your car has Starkel's DNA and blood.
BRENNAN:
As well as cosmetics that were found on his clothing.
Plus your tires match the tires that were found at the site where the body was dumped.
(voice breaking):
He slept with so many women.
Why not me?
And you just, what, you wanted to get close to him?
I-I drove up behind him.
And I have an electric car, so I guess he didn't, he didn't hear me.
And I got right up to him, you know?
I just wanted to surprise him.
So I honked my horn.
You startled him.
But he just dropped.
And-and-and he hit his head on-on the parking block.
So I got out and I-I ran to him and I tried to help him.
But... he was just...
I...
I just wanted to get his attention, okay?
I-I just wanted him to see how good I look.
'Cause that was all because of him.
He died the instant you honked your horn.
So you put him in your car and you dumped his body.
You dumped his body.
I didn't know what else to do.
I didn't want anybody to think it was my fault.
But it was, Debra.

Ah, since the case is over, Dr. Saroyan, I thought it be okay for us to share a little wine.
Certainly make our conversation a lot easier.
I agree.
Okay, if we run out,
I have more in my office.
Really?
Yeah.
Doing what we do,
I'm surprised we all don't.
Please, sit.
O-Okay.
(clears throat)
(sighs)
(exhales) So, you-you want to... uh, to talk, um, about your book.
Yes.
I can't tell you how much it's meant to me that you guys all read my book.
As your friends, we-we want to be honest with you.
Of course.
But, uh, first, I would like if we could all raise our paper cups.
I can't imagine a more wonderful group of friends to share this good news with.
I'm being published.
What?
The same publishers who published Dr. Brennan.
They think my book is perfect for them.
They're promising a big release.
We-we... we should drink!
To-to Murder Made Me Do It.
Down the old hatch.
Now, look, I-I know that I'm published now, but I would really still like your feedback.
So, uh...
MONTENEGRO:
Well, I... for one, I-I loved it.
SAROYAN:
Me, too.
This is... the best book I've read in a long time.
It was riveting.
I gotta tell you,
I can't believe you all loved it.
I know.
Neither can I.
Published.
Yeah.
BRENNAN (laughing):
Oh, no.
Hello.
Hey.
Where's Booth?
Oh, he's dealing with Ronnie the one-man band.
(drumming, clanging)
Bones.
Bones!
Bones, Bones, Bones!
Come here, come here.
(squeaking)
Why are you wearing that?
What do you mean?
Well, Ronnie, Ronnie.
Look at him.
He's passed out, and I don't want him drooling all over the kids.
Well, you can't play that.
What-what do you mean I can't?
What?
You just do this.
(cymbal clangs)
One of these.
(plays accordion, squeaks)
And Pops, you know, he taught me how to play the harmonica.
Listen.
(plays harmonica)
(chuckles) Right?
(plays accordion)
Right.
So come on.
Help me in the back.
Make sure everything's all hooked up.
(plays accordion)
Christine is happy just playing with her friends, Booth.
Look, all right, I don't want to disappoint Christine.
I promised my little girl that I would get her the one-man band.
(plays accordion) And that's what she's gonna get.
(plays harmonica) Okay.
(Booth playing lively song) What's happening?

BOOTH:
No, no.
Let-let me just finish here, honey, okay?
No, Mommy said tag.
You're not afraid, are you?
I'm kind of at a disadvantage here.
Okay.
And Mommy always won.
Want to go?
I told her it was my favorite game.
Tag, you're it!
Tag, tag, tag!

Oh, no!
Don't get me!
Oh, did he get you?
(laughing, yelling happily)
Oh, you got me!
I'm It!
(laughs)
Oh, I'm at a serious disadvantage here, Bones.
Well, that's because you're playing me.
Ah!
Ha-ha!
You're It!

Go!
MONTENEGRO:
Get him!
Get him!
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
What's that mean?
So, what do you think?
This feels different, doesn't it?
What does?
Rolling up to a crime scene as a married couple.
We're like Nick and Nora Charles.
Ooh, like "McMillan Wife."
- "Hart to Hart." - "Turner Hooch."
Turner and Hooch aren't even married.
Yeah, but you still remind me a little of Hooch.
So, uh, morning blend?
- Did this just happen?
- Yeah.
Jogger found him about an hour ago.
Which was about the time he died.
Needless to say, pretty obvious what killed him.
Gunshot wound to the head.
"Him" being Paul Reeves out of queens.
We're running down next of kin.
- Anyone hear the shot?
- No, and there's no video coverage in this area of the park.
The killer probably knew that.
Took Reeves' phone, cash from his wallet, and probably waltzed right out of here.
- Looks like a mugging gone wrong.
- Well, there's no signs of struggle.
If this was a mugging and he didn't put up a fight, why risk shooting him, especially in broad daylight?
Singed fabric.
Nobody heard anything because the killer used a backpack or cloth to muffle the shot.
And then took the victim's phone and cash to throw us off track.
This wasn't a mugging.
This was a deliberate murder.
That just doesn't make sense.
Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Well, how much do you know about your brother's life?
- Were you close?
- Very close.
In fact, Paul had been staying at my place for the past month.
He was waiting to close escrow on a condo.
Was having coffee in the park something he did often?
He never went to the park.
He hardly ever left the office.
- Paul was a complete workaholic.
- And what did he do, exactly?
He was an investigator for the government, the G.A.O.
I don't know much more than that.
He really couldn't discuss his job.
Was he having any troubles at work that you're aware of?
Not trouble exactly, but...
Last night, we had a beer.
Paul said a crucial meeting came up that he was worried about.
What kind of a meeting?
I mean w-with whom?
He didn't say, but he'd got a disturbing call from someone involved in one of his cases.
And he said... that meeting...
I think that was supposed to happen this morning.
I-I'm sorry, but if he had a meeting, he never mentioned anything to me, though I suppose that wasn't unusual.
I gave him a lot of latitude.
Paul was my top investigator.
What exactly did Paul investigate?
We're a federal agency.
G.A.O. Evaluates government programs and contracts to root out waste, fraud, and abuse.
Like defense contractors billing 500 bucks for a hammer.
Yes, though Paul was in the healthcare division.
He oversaw hospitals and medical services with government contracts...
that sort of thing.
So if someone was fleecing Uncle Sam, he could cancel their contracts?
He wrote reports that could produce that result, yes.
Did anyone ever pressure Paul to back off a report or investigation?
It doesn't work that way.
We're an independent body, so...
Be that as it may, we need the files of all his active investigations.
Paul Reeves had over 20 open cases, and he was taking on some major players... a hospital chain that defrauded medicare, a-a lab at Latham Pharmaceuticals cited for lax storage practices, and a company that sold the V.A. defective medical equipment.
I feel the heavy hand of conspiracy.
Yeah, well, what else is new?
Consider this...
Paul uncovers a nefarious scandal rife with corruption and financial skullduggery in connection with a federal contract, but with millions of dollars at stake, the greedy contractor, determined to stay latched onto the federal teat, lures Paul into a meeting in the park
where he has an assassin silence him.
Thus, Paul's findings never come to light.
And I don't suppose that you have a particular case of Paul's in mind, do you?
Or proof?
Or suspects?
No, but I will once you identify who met Paul at the park.
I might be a step closer to that.
Do you remember how Paul's brother mentioned that a "meeting" had just come up?
Well, I looked into Paul's phone calls for the last 48 hours.
One of them stood out... an incoming call to his office at 11:04 yesterday morning.
Call lasted less than a minute, and I traced it to a pay phone on the lower east side.
Try and find out who made that call.
Yeah.
This is street-cam video of the pay phone.
11:04 yesterday morning... this is the man who called Paul Reeves.
Tory ran the image and got a match on his face.
Jared Stone...
misdemeanor computer trespassing?
Otherwise known as hacking.
Stone was an occupy Wall Street activist who hacked into a major bank, releasing their e-mails, which reflected poorly on their business practices.
So why would a hacker like Jared Stone kill a G.A.O. investigator?
He wouldn't.
That story doesn't make any sense.
But this one does.
Using his vaunted hacking skills,
Jared Stone is the one who uncovered the nefarious scandal.
So we're back to a nefarious scandal?
Yes, see, he wants to blow the lid off a scandal, so who better to call than intrepid investigator Paul Reeves?
Because... wait for it...
Jared Stone is a whistle-blower.
And Paul Reeves was murdered because of what Jared Stone told him, which... which actually means he could be in danger now.
You have to admit, Castle's theory is... surprisingly logical.
Yes, and it's conveniently unburdened by evidence.
Nevertheless, let's bring Jared Stone in for questioning, and let's take a look at the video footage of that pay phone for the past two weeks.
If Jared Stone talked to anyone, I want to know who it was.
Yo, we may have an address on Jared Stone.
I ran his e-mails.
He rented a place on the lower west off Craigslist.
- Go.
- Yeah, okay.
So, what's going on with married life, huh?
How is that... the whole family thing?
Sarah Grace, she's...
she's growing up, changing so fast.
Just trying to hold on to every second.
Hey, what kind of dad do you think I'd be?
You'd be great.
Even growing up with no role model?
Well, you know, the thing of it is, is that you know what it's like not having a father.
You'd make sure your kid never felt that way.
You and Lanie...
Hmm?
No.
She likes things how they are.
But, you know, maybe I'm ready for more than that, you know what I'm saying?
Move forward.
Huh.
Hey, you hear that?
That sound?
No.
What sound?
It's my biological clock ticking.
Tick, tock, tick.
We were having a genuine, honest moment here, and you had to ruin it by being a jackass.
Hold on, hold on.
Slow down, slow down.
That's Jared Stone.
Hang tight here.
I'll follow him on foot, make sure we don't lose him.
Hey, bro.
Yeah, I followed him down to the subway.
I'm looking for him now.
What, you lost him?
No, I didn't lose him.
I just don't have visual contact.
That's kind of splitting hairs, isn't it?
Look, I-I'll head down there, and...
No, no, no.
You stay there.
I'll... wait, I see him.
He's at my 12.
Yeah, he's moving fast.
He's scared, like someone's after him.
If someone is, you'd better get to him before they do.
Whoever killed Reeves may be gunning for Stone.
He's boarding the 7th Ave.
Express.
All right, I'm on the train with Stone.
You're holding an uncapped marker, and you're telling me you were not about to tag this subway car?
Yes.
I-I mean no.
I need to see some identification.
I'm gonna have to write you up for this.
Jared Stone?
Hey.
You're not in trouble, bro, but, uh...
Look, I'm just here to talk to you.
Don't!
Put your gun on the ground!
Now!
Put your gun on the ground now.
Do it.
Kick it over to me.
Step back.
Nobody else move.
Nobody's moving, man.
All right, I just came here to talk to you.
I'm on your side.
No, you're a blunt instrument, a tool of the one percent.
Look, nobody's hurt yet, so this is just a big misunderstanding.
So why don't you lower that weapon, and we can walk right out of here?
- Oh, is that really possible?
- It is, yeah.
You just have to put the gun down, Jared.
What the hell is that?
Are you on the phone?
Everybody, shut off your phones and get the ground now!
Javi!
Javi!
S07E08 Kill Switch
Stay down, don't move, and nobody gets hurt.
This cannot be happening.
Please, look, don't do this.
- Okay?
don't hurt my wife.
- Or the rest of us.
Let's be inclusive.
Hey, everybody just stay calm, all right?
We're all gonna be fine.
Look, you're not in charge.
I am.
Hey, I pulled the emergency brake.
Why hasn't the conductor come over the intercom yet?
Well, maybe he... shh!
You feel that?
That's movement.
Like people are getting off the train, e-evacuating.
How do they know?
- Who were you on the phone with?
- Just a friend, man.
Oh, what kind of friend?
Was it another cop?
Was it a cop, huh?
I can hit redial if I want.
Yeah, he was a... he was NYPD, but that doesn't mean anything.
Okay, shut up.
Okay, everybody just stop talking, okay?
I got to... think.
He took my service weapon.
How did I let him do that?
Hey, it could happen to anybody, okay?
I'm Javier, Javier Esposito.
Marisa Aragon.
Jared?
May I call you Jared?
Grant Gerber, salesman by trade, which means I'm a listener.
I listen and learn what people want so I can give it to them.
Let me do that for you, Jared.
I want to help you get what you want.
I think you'll get your chance.
I've just been informed that Jared Stone, a person of interest in the Paul Reeves case, drew a gun on a subway and took hostages, including Detective Esposito.
At this point, it's not clear why...
Hey, if anybody can handle it, Espo can.
Or what his agenda is...
But why would Stone take hostages?
Right now our sole priority is to gather any and all information on Jared Stone so the hostage-rescue team will know who we're dealing with.
All intel comes to me so that I can forward it directly to HRT.
They should be on the scene right now.
- Detective Ryan?
- Yes, sir.
Captain Bigelow, HRT.
What's your intel on your suspect?
Sir, he's a hacker, an occupy Wall Street activist.
It's all sketchy.
What about your boy Esposito?
Is he someone we can count on?
- He's solid?
- He's as solid as they get.
Roger that.
Hey, Beckett.
I'm sorry.
Kevin, no one could have seen this coming.
No, no, he's my partner.
I should have never let him go in there alone.
We got to focus on getting Javi out of there, so once you brief HRT, just head over to Stone's apartment.
Leave the scene?
There's nothing that you can do that HRT isn't already doing.
And if we want to help Javi out, then the best thing that we can do is find out who Jared Stone is and why he is doing this, and some of those answers might be at his apartment.
Okay.
I'll check it out and let you know.
Kate, is it true... what they're saying?
Listen, he has been in worse scrapes than this, and we're gonna get him out of there, I promise you.
Detective Beckett, Dr. Parish, we've got eyes on Esposito.
Where's this coming from?
I didn't think the MTA had cameras in the subway cars.
They don't.
The train is part of a pilot program for video security.
This is on a separate feed, so it took me a while to find it.
Wait, if this is on a separate feed...
That means that we can see Stone, but he doesn't know that.
Which gives us a tactical edge.
I'll make sure HRT knows about this.
At least Javi's not down there alone.
There's another cop with him.
Yeah, between the two of them, they might be able to diffuse the situation.
Kind of a weird time for him to be hitting his playlist.
He's trying to calm himself down.
Because he's about to do what?
I might need you to back me up.
Can you do that?
What's your play?
Talk to him, try to get him to see the light, then disarm him if I get the chance.
I should talk to him.
I'm the one wearing the kevlar.
Yeah, but I've already got a rapport with the guy, so...
A bad rapport.
I know what this is.
I'm just a transit cop.
You gold-shield guys, always acting like you're better than us.
We are better than you.
Mr. Stone?
!
Permission to speak?
Go ahead.
That is far enough.
Look, whatever went down between you and Paul Reeves, this is only gonna make it worse.
This wasn't supposed to happen... not here.
This wasn't part of the plan.
Then we can come up with a new plan... one where you walk out of here.
You can still do that.
It's too late.
Police are already involved.
It...
I know there's no turning back.
You have to turn back, Jared, 'cause if you don't, here's what's gonna happen.
HRT... that's the hostage rescue team... will wait for you to get weak and tired, then a dozen highly trained guys armed to the teeth will breach this car.
And trust me when I tell you...
they will not play.
You'll be lucky to get off one shot before they drop you.
HRT won't come near me... not once they know I have this.
Oh, my God, a suicide vest.
His left hand.
That's a dead man's switch.
If he lets go of that...
Clearly, Jared Stone is not a whistle-blower.
He's a terrorist wearing an explosive vest.
This was a planned attack.
I'll contact homeland, see what they have on him.
Keep working intel on Jared Stone.
Obviously, the man is not at all who we thought he was.
Jared, what are you doing, man?
It's kind of self-explanatory, isn't it?
Look, I know you're an activist and you're all about taking on the one percent, but do you see anybody like that here?
Look, I may be a salesman, but just so you know, I'm not a big earner.
Okay, I am barely scraping by.
Jared, these are working people... your people.
You don't want to hurt them.
You're right.
I don't.
But I will if I have to.
Take a picture.
Text it to HRT.
I need you to tell me everything you know about Jared Stone.
Just that he wanted the apartment for two weeks, so I rented it to him.
Did you meet the guy, talk to him?
Just when I gave him the key and told him I did not permit wild parties.
What's this about?
All right, comb through every inch of this place.
Look through all his papers, personal items, anything that can tell us who Jared Stone is or what he's up to.
E-excuse me, gentlemen, but could I ask you to remove your shoes?
The carpet is brand-new.
Just a thought.
Thank you.
Homeland doesn't have a file on Jared Stone.
Neither does NYPD counter-terrorism.
Why would Stone blow up the subway?
I-I-I've been reading his posts on income inequality.
He's a little pedantic, but he's an armchair revolutionary.
He's not a man of action.
Maybe he became radicalized somehow.
"The taking of pelham 123" could not have been his plan.
He must have been headed someplace else when Esposito stopped him.
He was.
Stone was set to attend a wealth-management seminar with 1,500 people at the Tremaine Hotel.
That's where he was going when Esposito came along.
The 7th Avenue express would have taken him right there.
And if he was after one-percenters, this seminar would be a target-rich environment.
Sir, he also had a backup target.
He had seats to an opera at the biggest theater on Broadway...
1,900 seats.
He was going for maximum casualties, and he's willing to kill himself in the process.
I'll pass this on to HRT.
Oh, uh, one more thing.
Tory ran video on that pay phone.
Stone did use it before.
He called the Maldives last week twice.
The Maldives?
Who was he talking to?
The cellphone he has is no longer active.
Can't track it down.
Oh.
Gates.
HRT is asking,
"what kind of pizza does Detective Esposito like?"
Uh, uh, pineapple, olives, and, uh, double jalapeno, sir.
I'll pass it along.
Uh... pineapple...
Since when does a hacker, who by his very nature tends to live his life virtually, morph into a suicide bomber?
Stone has no history of violence.
You think something happened to trigger him?
I don't know, but there's a piece missing here somewhere.
H-how does a G.A.O. investigator fit into this?
The calls to the Maldives?
- Has Ryan turned anything up?
- No, so far, no word.
Excuse me.
This receipt from two days ago for the shredder...
- did you buy it?
- No.
I don't even know where that came from.
It really doesn't fit.
Then Stone bought it.
Excuse me.
Could you...
He's shredding documents.
Okay, we need to bag this up and take it back to the precinct, put it back together, find out what Stone was trying to hide.
So, how did you find me?
How did you track me down?
Do you know about White Knight?
What's White Knight?
That'll be the negotiator.
You want something, right?
Now would be the time to ask for it.
Hello?
Yes, I-it is.
Hello, Bob.
You're the negotiator?
I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, th-th-they're all fine, too.
Uh, let me ask.
Is, uh, anybody hungry?
- I'm always hungry.
- So am I.
Yeah, um e-everybody could use some food right about now.
Um...
Well, you do that, Bob.
Demands.
Do I have demands?
Yeah.
I got one.
You listening?
I want Aaron Wilson released from prison.
You call me back when you have a plan to make that happen.
That's all he said?
Who the hell is Aaron Wilson?
Well, if we want to save these people, we need to find out.
Okay, let's find who this Aaron Wilson is.
Wait a minute.
Castle, it's a woman...
E-r-i-n.
She's serving seven years in federal prison for felony computer trespassing.
So she's a hacker, too.
Court records show that she hacked a database at the New York federal reserve, looking for proof that the fed colluded with the big banks.
What's her connection to Stone?
It looks like Jared Stone was an accomplice, but the U.S. attorney didn't have enough to charge him.
So they were partners in crime.
Erin went to prison, Stone didn't.
That's why he wants to get her out.
He feels guilty.
That would also explain the Maldives.
- What do you mean?
- It's a non-extradition country.
Hey, guys, you need to see this.
What was in that shredder was about two pages of text.
So far, we've been able to assemble a few random words, like "monitor" and "surveillance."
Okay, what do you think it is?
It's some kind of letter, but I don't think that Stone was the one who wrote it.
Take a look at this phrase that we assembled just now.
"Read, memorize, and then destroy"?
It's not like he would write that to himself.
So they're instructions.
Now we know Stone is working with other people.
Maybe this is all about Erin Wilson.
Maybe she's the one behind all this.
Castle and I will look into Erin Wilson and dig deeper, and we'll also see if we can identify any associates that Jared might have had.
We'll keep piecing this together here.
Guys, everyone down there is counting on us.
Hey.
Who's Erin Wilson?
She's my soul mate.
Well, why not give Bob more to go on so he knew who you were talking about?
I want to keep him off-balance, maintain control.
You get that tip off the Internet?
'Cause it's not a very good one.
What's White Knight?
Tell me your plan for Erin.
What the hell is taking so long, Bob?
Getting her in prison didn't seem to take any time at all!
D...
Bob, shut up!
Shut up!
Listen to me.
I want her flown to the Maldives.
Yeah, well, I'm telling you now, Bob.
Okay.
I want her flown to the Maldives, and in half an hour, I want your plan on how to make that happen.
Are we clear?
Yeah, Bob, food would be great right about now.
No. don't send any cops.
I don't care if they're unarmed, Bob!
I don't want any police near this car!
Just drop the food!
Then set it on the edge of the platform!
I'll send somebody to get it.
You, the husband, go.
Get the food.
I know you'll come back.
I just got bad news.
I called the prison and spoke to Erin Wilson.
And?
She's Stone's girlfriend, but she didn't seem to know about his plan to break her out until just now.
What about you?
Anything on Stone's known associates?
Stone may have lived online, but he wasn't very social.
He started a "Free Erin Wilson" website but didn't seem to interact with any other users.
He had to have interacted with somebody.
Tech scrubbed his computer and found a hidden directory that they think contained private correspondence.
- From whom?
- The contents were thoroughly erased.
The only thing that was left was the name of the directory...
"White Knight."
Okay, who's next?
We got double cheese, pepperoni, mushroom.
Uh, right here.
Thanks.
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.
Veggie with eggplant and garlic.
Pineapple, olives, double jalapeno.
- That's for me.
- Really?
We're trapped in a subway car.
I'm not sure you should eat that.
You gonna eat that thing, or just gaze at it in wonder?
I don't understand.
Why does HRT want to breach?
In their assessment, Stone is trapped, with no good options and no way to carry out his original plan.
They believe the longer this goes, the more likely he will do the unthinkable.
Well, why not see how things play out with Erin Wilson?
HRT thinks the Erin Wilson demand is a ruse,
Stone is playing this card to buy time, work up his nerve.
If they bust in, what'll keep Stone from blowing that vest?
Esposito will.
He's in on it.
Won't Stone see HRT coming?
Yes, if they approach via the tunnel, but they're dropping onto the train from above, through the subway grates.
When?
Soon.
Any moment now.
You sure we shouldn't tell the others?
No.
They'll get nervous, and Stone will pick up on it.
Hey, why did you become a cop?
I got out of the army.
It's what made the most sense.
Me too.
You miss the service?
Some parts.
Not others.
Married?
Kids?
No. don't do this, okay?
Don't try to take my mind off of what's coming.
I don't need anyone holding my hand.
You know, you got a chip on your shoulder the size of Stonehenge.
I was just trying to get to know you a little bit.
Oh.
- You see that?
- Sure did.
The next flicker is go time.
- You clear on the plan?
- Don't worry about me.
I can feel vibrations.
They're on the train.
You pull your people back now or everybody dies.
Now!
I know they're here!
Don't screw with me, Bob, or I will pull my hand off this trigger right now!
How am I supposed to trust they're gone, huh?
You just tried to send storm troopers into a subway car full of people, not knowing where they are or where I am...
Wait a second.
Don't worry.
He's gonna be okay.
I know.
I know.
How is she?
Well, at least when she could see Javi, she knew he was okay.
We'll get Espo back.
The key is finding out who Stone was working with.
The answer's probably in that White Knight directory.
But so far, but tech hasn't been able to recover any of the data.
Well, then, we'll revisit the victim.
Looking into Paul reeve's investigations is what led us to Stone.
Perhaps it'll lead us to the others, as well.
Yeah.
Tory, let me ask you something.
Uh, t-the video from the subway... before it cut out, did you record it?
Of course.
All streaming video is archived automatically.
Why?
Could you show it to me?
There's something I'd like to see.
These are all 20 of the case files Paul Reeves was working on.
Here's just a summary of those cases.
I figure we just go through these until something points to Stone or to Erin Wilson or anything else we're dealing with.
Okay.
I'll start.
Uh, the first one is that pharmaceutical lab cited for losing samples of a flu virus.
Not ringing any bells.
Moving on to a medical chain that knowingly implanted defective artificial hips.
Hey, guys, that document...
I think it's a playbook.
Stone's following it to the letter.
Take a look at this sentence fragment.
"Demand Erin Wilson's release from prison, then hang up."
More instructions?
I mean, how is that telling us anything we don't already know?
You'll see.
Now take a look at this one.
"And demand Erin be flown to a non-extradition country."
But that instruction comes later on in the document, which is exactly how Stone played it.
First, he demanded her release, and then he brought up the Maldives.
That doesn't make any sense.
If Stone wanted Erin Wilson freed from prison, then why would he wait to mention the Maldives until later?
For the same reason he asked about Erin Wilson's release without explaining who she was.
Stone is stalling.
He's playing for time.
Something else is going on here, something big.
Kate, I need to show you something.
I noticed something when I was watching earlier, so I went to watch this whole video.
We have a problem... a new problem.
This is Stone back when he was just holding them all hostage.
This is him later... and later.
His asthma's getting worse.
It's not just his asthma.
It looks like he has fever and chills.
It's only a matter of time before he's not able to think clearly.
The man is sick, and he's getting sicker with flu-like symptoms.
Flu-like symptoms?
Uh, Castle, that case.
Paul Reeves was investigating a missing flu virus.
This is all connected somehow.
It has to be.
Once I hear that she's in international airspace,
I'll surrender.
Because I'm giving you my word.
Stone's not looking too good.
Hey, exactly how long is that gonna take, huh?
If he passes out and releases that switch, we're all dead.
- We got to make a move.
- Bob, Bob, Bob, that's...
- The same plan as before?
- That's not acceptable.
Yeah.
When?
He gets distracted when he puffs on his inhaler.
Next puff, we go.
Look, those are my conditions.
Once I hear from Erin that she's free,
I swear, I'll let everybody go.
Don't worry, everyone.
It's almost over.
No, stop!
- Please!
- Secure the switch.
I'm not done yet!
I'm not done yet!
Go, go, go, go.
Good job.
Hey, Javi.
What's up?
We took down Stone.
Nobody's hurt.
Everybody's fine.
It's over.
It's not over, man.
What?
What do you mean, it's not over?
I don't want a ticker-tape parade or anything like that, but did you not just hear what I said?
Listen, Javi.
This is about more than a suicide vest.
The CDC turned up a lethal variant of the H5N1 virus in Stone's apartment.
It's a hot zone.
Stone's infected... and everyone around him might be, too.
I got the door open!
I got it!
Close that door!
I said close it now!
Nobody leaves the train!
Sir, how is Esposito?
Well, he and the others were transported to the hospital,
- but they're in isolation.
- What's the prognosis?
Well, this particular strain of H5N1 is lethal and can be spread through airborne contact.
But there is a vaccine.
It's been given to the passengers, and it can knock down the virus even after exposure.
So he's gonna be okay?
Doctors are optimistic.
And the CDC is retracing Stone's steps to identify who else he was in contact with.
This guy's like an evil version of typhoid Mary.
The suicide vest, the demands... all about exposing people long enough to get them infected so they'd spread the virus.
Well, it could have been far worse if he had made it to that seminar or the opera.
In proximity to all those people, he could have caused an epidemic.
But I-I-I'm still not clear.
How does our shooting victim fit into all this?
Paul Reeves was investigating the lab where a sample of H5N1 went missing.
We think he figured out that Stone had stolen the virus, which is why Stone lured him into the park and killed him.
But, sir, there are still questions, like who Stone was working with and why he did this in the first place, so we need to go and talk to him.
Well, you better hurry up because I hear he's not in good shape.
Yes, sir.
You're not the priest.
No, but I can take your confession.
We know you had help, Mr. Stone.
White Knight... who is he?
Someone I met through the "Free Erin" site a few months back.
What was his real name?
I don't know.
We bonded over Erin...
Over how to get her out.
He was a strategic thinker.
I wasn't, so he helped me with the plan.
I never would have detonated that vest.
I just...
I just needed some leverage.
I love Erin.
All I wanted was to see her free.
More like you wanted to get people sick.
What do you mean?
You tried to start an epidemic by spreading your deadly virus.
Erin was just a sideshow.
- What are you talking about?
- The opera, the seminar... hundreds of one-percenters in close proximity.
That was the perfect environment to spread your disease.
It... disease?
No, I...
I was trying to find the best spot to take my stand for Erin.
Then why did you call Paul Reeves?
White Knight s-said that it was part of the plan.
I-I... called Reeves to tell him about some meeting at the park.
I didn't even know who he was.
The seminar and the opera... were those White Knight's ideas, too?
So I was set up.
Somebody used me.
This thing I have...
I may have given it to other people, too?
Okay, that is not how I imagined that conversation would go.
If Stone's telling the truth, then he's a fall guy.
He was groomed, turned into a vector for the virus, and manipulated into spreading it.
Which means this all connects to Paul Reeves' investigation of the lab where the virus came from.
Stone was deliberately infected.
The CDC confirmed that someone turned his asthma inhaler into a virus-delivery system.
The question is, who came up with that idea?
The answer has got to be connected to this lab that Paul was investigating.
I think it is.
Beckett, take a look at this.
The, uh, lab from which the virus went missing... uh, Latham Pharmaceuticals...
they're the same company that makes the vaccine that Espo and the others got.
Which is why they had samples of H5N1 in the first place.
Right, but as part of his investigation,
Paul was looking into production orders of the vaccine... specifically, this one for 10 million units of the vaccine.
Castle, there were only 1,000 reported cases of H5N1 worldwide.
So why would Latham suddenly order up 10 million vaccines?
Unless they knew that there was gonna be an outbreak.
I think Paul was asking the same question.
Ms. Jarvis, thank you for taking the time.
O-of course.
Yeah, d... have you found whoever, uh, did this to Paul?
No, not yet, but we do have a few questions.
Now, do you know why he was investigating Latham Pharmaceuticals?
It was his job.
Companies that produce vaccines with federal money are tracked by G.A.O.
And Latham developed a vaccine for a rare but deadly flu virus, didn't they?
I mean, a flu so rare that the vaccine just sits on the shelf.
Yeah, we see that a lot.
Preventive vaccines are created, but not all flu strains become widespread.
- Well, they do with a little help.
- Excuse me?
You recently converted all of your assets to Latham stock.
Why is that?
How I invest is none of your concern.
It became my concern when you tried to start an H5N1 epidemic.
With the help of someone gullible, someone you could easily manipulate, like Jared Stone.
What on earth are you talking about?
I d...
I don't know any Jared Stone.
Your husband was one of the prosecutors who put away his girlfriend, Erin Wilson.
So when you needed a patsy, you knew just where to look.
And then your colleague Paul, when he saw that huge vaccine order, he started digging.
And when you saw that he was getting closer to the truth, you eliminated him.
That is absurd.
You can't prove any of this.
Actually, we can.
We found the e-mails you wrote in your cloud account, under the username "White Knight."
We also arrested a Latham executive with whom you were colluding.
He admitted to his role, and he cut a deal.
And he threw you under the bus.
You could have infected and killed millions of people, Ms. Jarvis.
And for what, so you could drive a nicer car, buy a bigger house?
Was this all just because of money?
- I want a lawyer.
- You better find a good one.
Hey.
Hey.
So, I, uh...
I hear everybody's good to go.
Clean bills of health.
This time yesterday, catching the flu was the least of our problems.
You did all right down there.
I don't care what they say about transit cops.
Mm.
What they say about gold shields is even worse... mostly 'cause it's true.
We make a tight team.
Bonds forged in the heat of battle...
you know how it is.
Yeah.
I wasn't straight with you.
I have a 5-year-old son.
Uh, you said that you didn't have a family.
Why hide that?
I didn't want you worried about me being a mom down there.
You are a piece of work, Marisa.
Who's Lenny?
Or is it Lanie?
How do you know about her?
On my last tour, an I.E.D. blew out my eardrum.
Got pretty good at reading lips.
You were saying her name before you took down Stone.
Yeah, I don't...
I don't remember that.
Who you think of in that moment...
it has weight.
Don't trade what's real for something that isn't.
I'll see you around, Javi.
Well, it's not every day you come across someone who makes a suicide bomber look like the good guy.
So, I talked to the hospital.
Jared Stone will make a full recovery, though clearly his troubles aren't over yet.
Yeah, unless he goes to the same prison as Erin Wilson, because in the end, Jared Stone was driven by the most primal of emotions...
love.
Except he could have picked a better way to express it.
Hey, look who's here.
What's up?
- Hey!
- Hail the conquering hero!
Man, you gave me a scare.
- That's because you're a wimp.
- Oh.
Okay.
Yeah, well, I guess that makes me a wimp, too.
Oh.
Got any of that left over for me?
Javi, I was worried sick.
I thought...
I know what you thought, but I'm here.
I'm back.
I'm all right.
I hate to interrupt, but I have a brilliant idea.
How about we all go to the old haunt, huh?
Drinks on me.
Yeah.
Come on, we'll take the subway.
- Too soon?
- Too soon.
Please accept this as a token of my apology.
Am I on the wrong track, here?
Castle:
So, what do you think?
This feels different, doesn't it?
What does?
Rolling up to a crime scene as a married couple.
We're like Nick and Nora Charles.
Ooh, like "McMillan Wife."
- "Hart to Hart." - "Turner Hooch."
Turner and Hooch aren't even married.
Yeah, but you still remind me a little of Hooch.
[Camera shutter clicks]
So, uh, morning blend?
- Did this just happen?
- Ryan:
Yeah.
Jogger found him about an hour ago.
Lanie:
Which was about the time he died.
Needless to say, pretty obvious what killed him.
Gunshot wound to the head.
"Him" being Paul Reeves out of queens.
We're running down next of kin.
- Anyone hear the shot?
- No, and there's no video coverage in this area of the park.
The killer probably knew that.
Took Reeves' phone, cash from his wallet, and probably waltzed right out of here.
- Looks like a mugging gone wrong.
- Well, there's no signs of struggle.
If this was a mugging and he didn't put up a fight, why risk shooting him, especially in broad daylight?
Singed fabric.
Nobody heard anything because the killer used a backpack or cloth to muffle the shot.
And then took the victim's phone and cash to throw us off track.
This wasn't a mugging.
This was a deliberate murder.
That just doesn't make sense.
Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Well, how much do you know about your brother's life?
- Were you close?
- Very close.
In fact, Paul had been staying at my place for the past month.
He was waiting to close escrow on a condo.
Was having coffee in the park something he did often?
He never went to the park.
He hardly ever left the office.
- Paul was a complete workaholic.
- And what did he do, exactly?
He was an investigator for the government, the G.A.O.
I don't know much more than that.
He really couldn't discuss his job.
Was he having any troubles at work that you're aware of?
Not trouble exactly, but...
Last night, we had a beer.
Paul said a crucial meeting came up that he was worried about.
What kind of a meeting?
I mean w-with whom?
He didn't say, but he'd got a disturbing call from someone involved in one of his cases.
And he said... that meeting...
I think that was supposed to happen this morning.
I-I'm sorry, but if he had a meeting, he never mentioned anything to me, though I suppose that wasn't unusual.
I gave him a lot of latitude.
Paul was my top investigator.
What exactly did Paul investigate?
We're a federal agency.
G.A.O. Evaluates government programs and contracts to root out waste, fraud, and abuse.
Like defense contractors billing 500 bucks for a hammer.
Yes, though Paul was in the healthcare division.
He oversaw hospitals and medical services with government contracts...
that sort of thing.
So if someone was fleecing Uncle Sam, he could cancel their contracts?
He wrote reports that could produce that result, yes.
Did anyone ever pressure Paul to back off a report or investigation?
It doesn't work that way.
We're an independent body, so...
Be that as it may, we need the files of all his active investigations.
Beckett:
Paul Reeves had over 20 open cases, and he was taking on some major players... a hospital chain that defrauded medicare, a-a lab at Latham Pharmaceuticals cited for lax storage practices, and a company that sold the V.A. defective medical equipment.
I feel the heavy hand of conspiracy.
Yeah, well, what else is new?
Consider this...
Paul uncovers a nefarious scandal rife with corruption and financial skullduggery in connection with a federal contract, but with millions of dollars at stake, the greedy contractor, determined to stay latched onto the federal teat, lures Paul into a meeting in the park
where he has an assassin silence him.
Thus, Paul's findings never come to light.
And I don't suppose that you have a particular case of Paul's in mind, do you?
Or proof?
Or suspects?
No, but I will once you identify who met Paul at the park.
I might be a step closer to that.
Do you remember how Paul's brother mentioned that a "meeting" had just come up?
Well, I looked into Paul's phone calls for the last 48 hours.
One of them stood out... an incoming call to his office at 11:04 yesterday morning.
Call lasted less than a minute, and I traced it to a pay phone on the lower east side.
Try and find out who made that call.
Yeah.
Tory:
This is street-cam video of the pay phone.
11:04 yesterday morning... this is the man who called Paul Reeves.
Tory ran the image and got a match on his face.
Jared Stone...
misdemeanor computer trespassing?
Otherwise known as hacking.
Stone was an occupy Wall Street activist who hacked into a major bank, releasing their e-mails, which reflected poorly on their business practices.
So why would a hacker like Jared Stone kill a G.A.O. investigator?
He wouldn't.
That story doesn't make any sense.
But this one does.
Using his vaunted hacking skills,
Jared Stone is the one who uncovered the nefarious scandal.
So we're back to a nefarious scandal?
Yes, see, he wants to blow the lid off a scandal, so who better to call than intrepid investigator Paul Reeves?
Because... wait for it...
Jared Stone is a whistle-blower.
And Paul Reeves was murdered because of what Jared Stone told him, which... which actually means he could be in danger now.
You have to admit, Castle's theory is... surprisingly logical.
Yes, and it's conveniently unburdened by evidence.
Nevertheless, let's bring Jared Stone in for questioning, and let's take a look at the video footage of that pay phone for the past two weeks.
If Jared Stone talked to anyone, I want to know who it was.
Yo, we may have an address on Jared Stone.
I ran his e-mails.
He rented a place on the lower west off Craigslist.
- Go.
- Yeah, okay.
Esposito:
So, what's going on with married life, huh?
How is that... the whole family thing?
Sarah Grace, she's...
she's growing up, changing so fast.
Just trying to hold on to every second.
Hey, what kind of dad do you think I'd be?
You'd be great.
Even growing up with no role model?
Well, you know, the thing of it is, is that you know what it's like not having a father.
You'd make sure your kid never felt that way.
You and Lanie...
Hmm?
No.
She likes things how they are.
But, you know, maybe I'm ready for more than that, you know what I'm saying?
Move forward.
Huh.
Hey, you hear that?
That sound?
No.
What sound?
It's my biological clock ticking.
Tick, tock, tick.
[Laughs] [Sighs]
We were having a genuine, honest moment here, and you had to ruin it by being a jackass.
Hold on, hold on.
Slow down, slow down.
That's Jared Stone.
Hang tight here.
I'll follow him on foot, make sure we don't lose him.
[Car door opens, closes]
[Indistinct talking over P.A.]
[Cellphone rings]
[Beep] Hey, bro.
Yeah, I followed him down to the subway.
I'm looking for him now.
What, you lost him?
No, I didn't lose him.
I just don't have visual contact.
That's kind of splitting hairs, isn't it?
Look, I-I'll head down there, and...
No, no, no.
You stay there.
I'll... wait, I see him.
He's at my 12.
Yeah, he's moving fast.
He's scared, like someone's after him.
If someone is, you'd better get to him before they do.
Whoever killed Reeves may be gunning for Stone.
He's boarding the 7th Ave.
Express.
[Train beeps]
All right, I'm on the train with Stone.
You're holding an uncapped marker, and you're telling me you were not about to tag this subway car?
Yes.
I-I mean no.
I need to see some identification.
I'm gonna have to write you up for this.
Jared Stone?
Hey.
You're not in trouble, bro, but, uh...
Look, I'm just here to talk to you.
Don't!
[Gun cocks]
[People gasp]
Put your gun on the ground!
Now!
[Brakes squealing]
[Electricity crackles]
[People scream]
[Air hisses]
Put your gun on the ground now.
Do it.
Kick it over to me.
Step back.
Nobody else move.
Nobody's moving, man.
All right, I just came here to talk to you.
I'm on your side.
No, you're a blunt instrument, a tool of the one percent.
Look, nobody's hurt yet, so this is just a big misunderstanding.
So why don't you lower that weapon, and we can walk right out of here?
- Oh, is that really possible?
- It is, yeah.
You just have to put the gun down, Jared.
What the hell is that?
Are you on the phone?
Everybody, shut off your phones and get the ground now!
[Beep] Javi!
Javi!
S07E08 Kill Switch
Stay down, don't move, and nobody gets hurt.
This cannot be happening.
Please, look, don't do this.
- Okay?
don't hurt my wife.
- Or the rest of us.
Let's be inclusive.
Hey, everybody just stay calm, all right?
We're all gonna be fine.
Look, you're not in charge.
I am.
[Breathing heavily]
Hey, I pulled the emergency brake.
Why hasn't the conductor come over the intercom yet?
Well, maybe he... shh!
You feel that?
That's movement.
Like people are getting off the train, e-evacuating.
How do they know?
- Who were you on the phone with?
- Just a friend, man.
Oh, what kind of friend?
Was it another cop?
Was it a cop, huh?
I can hit redial if I want.
Yeah, he was a... he was NYPD, but that doesn't mean anything.
Okay, shut up.
Okay, everybody just stop talking, okay?
I got to... think.
He took my service weapon.
How did I let him do that?
Hey, it could happen to anybody, okay?
I'm Javier, Javier Esposito.
Marisa Aragon.
[Clears throat] Jared?
May I call you Jared?
Grant Gerber, salesman by trade, which means I'm a listener.
I listen and learn what people want so I can give it to them.
Let me do that for you, Jared.
I want to help you get what you want.
I think you'll get your chance.
I've just been informed that Jared Stone, a person of interest in the Paul Reeves case, drew a gun on a subway and took hostages, including Detective Esposito.
At this point, it's not clear why...
Hey, if anybody can handle it, Espo can.
Or what his agenda is...
But why would Stone take hostages?
Right now our sole priority is to gather any and all information on Jared Stone so the hostage-rescue team will know who we're dealing with.
All intel comes to me so that I can forward it directly to HRT.
[Siren walls] They should be on the scene right now.
- Detective Ryan?
- Yes, sir.
Captain Bigelow, HRT.
What's your intel on your suspect?
Sir, he's a hacker, an occupy Wall Street activist.
It's all sketchy.
What about your boy Esposito?
Is he someone we can count on?
- He's solid?
- He's as solid as they get.
Roger that.
[Cellphone rings]
[Beep]
Hey, Beckett.
I'm sorry.
Kevin, no one could have seen this coming.
No, no, he's my partner.
I should have never let him go in there alone.
We got to focus on getting Javi out of there, so once you brief HRT, just head over to Stone's apartment.
Leave the scene?
There's nothing that you can do that HRT isn't already doing.
And if we want to help Javi out, then the best thing that we can do is find out who Jared Stone is and why he is doing this, and some of those answers might be at his apartment.
Okay.
I'll check it out and let you know.
Kate, is it true... what they're saying?
Listen, he has been in worse scrapes than this, and we're gonna get him out of there, I promise you.
Detective Beckett, Dr. Parish, we've got eyes on Esposito.
Beckett:
Where's this coming from?
I didn't think the MTA had cameras in the subway cars.
They don't.
The train is part of a pilot program for video security.
This is on a separate feed, so it took me a while to find it.
Wait, if this is on a separate feed...
That means that we can see Stone, but he doesn't know that.
Which gives us a tactical edge.
I'll make sure HRT knows about this.
At least Javi's not down there alone.
There's another cop with him.
Beckett:
Yeah, between the two of them, they might be able to diffuse the situation.
[Classical music plays]
Kind of a weird time for him to be hitting his playlist.
He's trying to calm himself down.
Because he's about to do what?
I might need you to back me up.
Can you do that?
What's your play?
Talk to him, try to get him to see the light, then disarm him if I get the chance.
I should talk to him.
I'm the one wearing the kevlar.
Yeah, but I've already got a rapport with the guy, so...
A bad rapport.
I know what this is.
I'm just a transit cop.
You gold-shield guys, always acting like you're better than us.
We are better than you.
Mr. Stone?
!
[Breathing heavily]
Permission to speak?
Go ahead.
That is far enough.
Look, whatever went down between you and Paul Reeves, this is only gonna make it worse.
This wasn't supposed to happen... not here.
This wasn't part of the plan.
Then we can come up with a new plan... one where you walk out of here.
You can still do that.
It's too late.
Police are already involved.
It...
I know there's no turning back.
You have to turn back, Jared, 'cause if you don't, here's what's gonna happen.
HRT... that's the hostage rescue team... will wait for you to get weak and tired, then a dozen highly trained guys armed to the teeth will breach this car.
And trust me when I tell you...
they will not play.
You'll be lucky to get off one shot before they drop you.
HRT won't come near me... not once they know I have this.
[All gasping]
[Beeping]
Oh, my God, a suicide vest.
His left hand.
That's a dead man's switch.
If he lets go of that...
Clearly, Jared Stone is not a whistle-blower.
Beckett:
He's a terrorist wearing an explosive vest.
This was a planned attack.
I'll contact homeland, see what they have on him.
Keep working intel on Jared Stone.
Obviously, the man is not at all who we thought he was.
Jared, what are you doing, man?
It's kind of self-explanatory, isn't it?
Look, I know you're an activist and you're all about taking on the one percent, but do you see anybody like that here?
Grant:
Look, I may be a salesman, but just so you know, I'm not a big earner.
Okay, I am barely scraping by.
Jared, these are working people... your people.
You don't want to hurt them.
You're right.
I don't.
But I will if I have to.
Take a picture.
Text it to HRT.
Ryan:
I need you to tell me everything you know about Jared Stone.
Just that he wanted the apartment for two weeks, so I rented it to him.
Did you meet the guy, talk to him?
Just when I gave him the key and told him I did not permit wild parties.
What's this about?
All right, comb through every inch of this place.
Look through all his papers, personal items, anything that can tell us who Jared Stone is or what he's up to.
E-excuse me, gentlemen, but could I ask you to remove your shoes?
The carpet is brand-new.
Just a thought.
Thank you.
Homeland doesn't have a file on Jared Stone.
Neither does NYPD counter-terrorism.
Why would Stone blow up the subway?
I-I-I've been reading his posts on income inequality.
He's a little pedantic, but he's an armchair revolutionary.
He's not a man of action.
Maybe he became radicalized somehow.
"The taking of pelham 123" could not have been his plan.
He must have been headed someplace else when Esposito stopped him.
Beckett:
He was. [Receiver clicks]
Stone was set to attend a wealth-management seminar with 1,500 people at the Tremaine Hotel.
That's where he was going when Esposito came along.
Gates:
The 7th Avenue express would have taken him right there.
And if he was after one-percenters, this seminar would be a target-rich environment.
Sir, he also had a backup target.
He had seats to an opera at the biggest theater on Broadway...
1,900 seats.
He was going for maximum casualties, and he's willing to kill himself in the process.
I'll pass this on to HRT.
Oh, uh, one more thing.
Tory ran video on that pay phone.
Stone did use it before.
He called the Maldives last week twice.
The Maldives?
Who was he talking to?
The cellphone he has is no longer active.
Can't track it down.
[Cellphone rings] Oh.
[Beep] Gates.
HRT is asking,
"what kind of pizza does Detective Esposito like?"
Uh, uh, pineapple, olives, and, uh, double jalapeno, sir.
I'll pass it along.
Uh... pineapple...
Since when does a hacker, who by his very nature tends to live his life virtually, morph into a suicide bomber?
Stone has no history of violence.
You think something happened to trigger him?
I don't know, but there's a piece missing here somewhere.
H-how does a G.A.O. investigator fit into this?
The calls to the Maldives?
- Has Ryan turned anything up?
- No, so far, no word.
Excuse me.
This receipt from two days ago for the shredder...
- did you buy it?
- No.
I don't even know where that came from.
It really doesn't fit.
Then Stone bought it.
Excuse me.
Could you...
He's shredding documents.
Okay, we need to bag this up and take it back to the precinct, put it back together, find out what Stone was trying to hide.
Jared:
So, how did you find me?
How did you track me down?
Do you know about White Knight?
What's White Knight?
[Cellphone ringing]
[Rattling]
[Inhales deeply]
That'll be the negotiator.
[Coughs]
[Ringing continues]
You want something, right?
Now would be the time to ask for it.
[Beep] Hello?
Yes, I-it is.
Hello, Bob.
You're the negotiator?
I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, th-th-they're all fine, too.
Uh, let me ask.
Is, uh, anybody hungry?
- I'm always hungry.
- So am I.
Yeah, um [Sniffs] e-everybody could use some food right about now. [Sniffs] Um...
Well, you do that, Bob.
Demands.
Do I have demands?
Yeah.
I got one.
[Sniffs] You listening?
I want Aaron Wilson released from prison.
You call me back when you have a plan to make that happen.
[Beep]
That's all he said?
Who the hell is Aaron Wilson?
Well, if we want to save these people, we need to find out.
Beckett:
Okay, let's find who this Aaron Wilson is.
[Keyboard clacking]
Wait a minute.
Castle, it's a woman...
E-r-i-n.
She's serving seven years in federal prison for felony computer trespassing.
So she's a hacker, too.
Court records show that she hacked a database at the New York federal reserve, looking for proof that the fed colluded with the big banks.
What's her connection to Stone?
It looks like Jared Stone was an accomplice, but the U.S. attorney didn't have enough to charge him.
So they were partners in crime.
Erin went to prison, Stone didn't.
That's why he wants to get her out.
He feels guilty.
That would also explain the Maldives.
- What do you mean?
- It's a non-extradition country.
Hey, guys, you need to see this.
What was in that shredder was about two pages of text.
So far, we've been able to assemble a few random words, like "monitor" and "surveillance."
Okay, what do you think it is?
It's some kind of letter, but I don't think that Stone was the one who wrote it.
Take a look at this phrase that we assembled just now.
"Read, memorize, and then destroy"?
It's not like he would write that to himself.
So they're instructions.
Now we know Stone is working with other people.
Maybe this is all about Erin Wilson.
Maybe she's the one behind all this.
Castle and I will look into Erin Wilson and dig deeper, and we'll also see if we can identify any associates that Jared might have had.
Ryan:
We'll keep piecing this together here.
Guys, everyone down there is counting on us.
Esposito:
Hey.
Who's Erin Wilson?
[Sniffs]
She's my soul mate.
[Coughs] Well, why not give Bob more to go on so he knew who you were talking about?
I want to keep him off-balance, maintain control.
You get that tip off the Internet?
'Cause it's not a very good one.
[Inhales deeply]
What's White Knight?
[Cellphone ringing] [Inhales deeply]
[Beep]
Tell me your plan for Erin.
What the hell is taking so long, Bob?
Getting her in prison didn't seem to take any time at all!
D...
Bob, shut up!
Shut up!
Listen to me.
I want her flown to the Maldives.
Yeah, well, I'm telling you now, Bob.
[Sniffs] Okay.
I want her flown to the Maldives, and in half an hour, I want your plan on how to make that happen.
Are we clear?
[Sniffs, breathing shakily]
Yeah, Bob, food would be great right about now.
No. don't send any cops.
I don't care if they're unarmed, Bob!
I don't want any police near this car!
Just drop the food!
Then set it on the edge of the platform!
I'll send somebody to get it.
[Beep]
You, the husband, go.
Get the food.
I know you'll come back.
I just got bad news.
I called the prison and spoke to Erin Wilson.
And?
She's Stone's girlfriend, but she didn't seem to know about his plan to break her out until just now.
What about you?
Anything on Stone's known associates?
Stone may have lived online, but he wasn't very social.
He started a "Free Erin Wilson" website but didn't seem to interact with any other users.
He had to have interacted with somebody.
Tech scrubbed his computer and found a hidden directory that they think contained private correspondence.
- From whom?
- The contents were thoroughly erased.
The only thing that was left was the name of the directory...
"White Knight."
Ty:
Okay, who's next?
We got double cheese, pepperoni, mushroom.
Uh, right here.
Thanks.
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.
Veggie with eggplant and garlic.
Pineapple, olives, double jalapeno.
- That's for me.
- Really?
We're trapped in a subway car.
I'm not sure you should eat that.
[Coughs]
Marisa:
You gonna eat that thing, or just gaze at it in wonder?
I don't understand.
Why does HRT want to breach?
In their assessment, Stone is trapped, with no good options and no way to carry out his original plan.
They believe the longer this goes, the more likely he will do the unthinkable.
Well, why not see how things play out with Erin Wilson?
HRT thinks the Erin Wilson demand is a ruse,
Stone is playing this card to buy time, work up his nerve.
If they bust in, what'll keep Stone from blowing that vest?
Esposito will.
He's in on it.
Won't Stone see HRT coming?
Yes, if they approach via the tunnel, but they're dropping onto the train from above, through the subway grates.
When?
Soon.
Any moment now.
You sure we shouldn't tell the others?
No.
They'll get nervous, and Stone will pick up on it.
Hey, why did you become a cop?
I got out of the army.
It's what made the most sense.
Me too.
You miss the service?
Some parts.
Not others.
Married?
Kids?
No. don't do this, okay?
Don't try to take my mind off of what's coming.
I don't need anyone holding my hand.
You know, you got a chip on your shoulder the size of Stonehenge.
I was just trying to get to know you a little bit.
Oh.
[Electricity buzzes]
- You see that?
- Sure did.
The next flicker is go time.
- You clear on the plan?
- Don't worry about me.
[Inhales deeply]
I can feel vibrations.
They're on the train.
[Electricity buzzes]
[Dialing]
[Beep]
You pull your people back now or everybody dies.
Now!
I know they're here!
Don't screw with me, Bob, or I will pull my hand off this trigger right now!
How am I supposed to trust they're gone, huh?
You just tried to send storm troopers into a subway car full of people, not knowing where they are or where I am...
[Beep]
Wait a second.
Beckett:
Don't worry.
He's gonna be okay.
I know.
I know.
How is she?
[Sighs]
Well, at least when she could see Javi, she knew he was okay.
We'll get Espo back.
The key is finding out who Stone was working with.
The answer's probably in that White Knight directory.
But so far, but tech hasn't been able to recover any of the data.
Well, then, we'll revisit the victim.
Looking into Paul reeve's investigations is what led us to Stone.
Perhaps it'll lead us to the others, as well.
Yeah.
Tory, let me ask you something.
Uh, t-the video from the subway... before it cut out, did you record it?
Of course.
All streaming video is archived automatically.
Why?
Could you show it to me?
There's something I'd like to see.
[Keyboard clacking]
These are all 20 of the case files Paul Reeves was working on.
Here's just a summary of those cases.
I figure we just go through these until something points to Stone or to Erin Wilson or anything else we're dealing with.
Okay.
I'll start.
Uh, the first one is that pharmaceutical lab cited for losing samples of a flu virus.
Not ringing any bells.
Moving on to a medical chain that knowingly implanted defective artificial hips.
Hey, guys, that document...
I think it's a playbook.
Stone's following it to the letter.
Take a look at this sentence fragment.
"Demand Erin Wilson's release from prison, then hang up."
More instructions?
I mean, how is that telling us anything we don't already know?
You'll see.
[Beep] Now take a look at this one.
"And demand Erin be flown to a non-extradition country."
But that instruction comes later on in the document, which is exactly how Stone played it.
First, he demanded her release, and then he brought up the Maldives.
That doesn't make any sense.
If Stone wanted Erin Wilson freed from prison, then why would he wait to mention the Maldives until later?
For the same reason he asked about Erin Wilson's release without explaining who she was.
Stone is stalling.
He's playing for time.
Something else is going on here, something big.
Kate, I need to show you something.
I noticed something when I was watching earlier, so I went to watch this whole video.
We have a problem... a new problem.
[Beep]
[Sighs] This is Stone back when he was just holding them all hostage.
This is him later... and later.
Castle:
His asthma's getting worse.
It's not just his asthma.
It looks like he has fever and chills.
It's only a matter of time before he's not able to think clearly.
The man is sick, and he's getting sicker with flu-like symptoms.
Flu-like symptoms?
Uh, Castle, that case.
Paul Reeves was investigating a missing flu virus.
This is all connected somehow.
It has to be.
Once I hear that she's in international airspace,
I'll surrender.
[Coughs]
[Sniffs, inhales deeply]
[Inhales deeply]
[Sighs]
Because I'm giving you my word.
Stone's not looking too good.
Hey, exactly how long is that gonna take, huh?
If he passes out and releases that switch, we're all dead.
- We got to make a move.
- Bob, Bob, Bob, that's...
- The same plan as before?
- That's not acceptable.
Yeah.
[Sighs] When?
He gets distracted when he puffs on his inhaler.
Next puff, we go.
Look, those are my conditions.
Once I hear from Erin that she's free,
I swear, I'll let everybody go.
[Beep]
[Sighs] Don't worry, everyone.
It's almost over. [Inhales deeply]
[All gasping]
No, stop!
- Please!
- Secure the switch.
I'm not done yet!
I'm not done yet!
Go, go, go, go.
Good job.
[All sigh]
[Dialing]
[Beep] Hey, Javi.
Esposito:
What's up?
We took down Stone.
Nobody's hurt.
Everybody's fine.
It's over.
It's not over, man.
What?
What do you mean, it's not over?
I don't want a ticker-tape parade or anything like that, but did you not just hear what I said?
Listen, Javi.
This is about more than a suicide vest.
The CDC turned up a lethal variant of the H5N1 virus in Stone's apartment.
It's a hot zone.
Stone's infected... and everyone around him might be, too.
I got the door open!
I got it!
Close that door!
I said close it now!
Nobody leaves the train!
Sir, how is Esposito?
Well, he and the others were transported to the hospital,
- but they're in isolation.
- What's the prognosis?
Well, this particular strain of H5N1 is lethal and can be spread through airborne contact.
But there is a vaccine.
It's been given to the passengers, and it can knock down the virus even after exposure.
So he's gonna be okay?
Doctors are optimistic.
And the CDC is retracing Stone's steps to identify who else he was in contact with.
This guy's like an evil version of typhoid Mary.
The suicide vest, the demands... all about exposing people long enough to get them infected so they'd spread the virus.
Well, it could have been far worse if he had made it to that seminar or the opera.
In proximity to all those people, he could have caused an epidemic.
But I-I-I'm still not clear.
How does our shooting victim fit into all this?
Paul Reeves was investigating the lab where a sample of H5N1 went missing.
We think he figured out that Stone had stolen the virus, which is why Stone lured him into the park and killed him.
Beckett:
But, sir, there are still questions, like who Stone was working with and why he did this in the first place, so we need to go and talk to him.
Well, you better hurry up because I hear he's not in good shape.
Yes, sir.
[Monitor beeping]
[Coughing]
You're not the priest.
No, but I can take your confession.
We know you had help, Mr. Stone.
White Knight... who is he?
[Sighs]
Someone I met through the "Free Erin" site a few months back.
What was his real name?
I don't know.
We bonded over Erin...
Over how to get her out.
He was a strategic thinker.
I wasn't, so he helped me with the plan.
I never would have detonated that vest.
I just...
I just needed some leverage.
I love Erin.
All I wanted was to see her free.
More like you wanted to get people sick.
What do you mean?
You tried to start an epidemic by spreading your deadly virus.
Erin was just a sideshow.
- What are you talking about?
- The opera, the seminar... hundreds of one-percenters in close proximity.
That was the perfect environment to spread your disease.
It... disease?
No, I...
I was trying to find the best spot to take my stand for Erin.
Then why did you call Paul Reeves?
White Knight s-said that it was part of the plan.
I-I... called Reeves to tell him about some meeting at the park.
I didn't even know who he was.
The seminar and the opera... were those White Knight's ideas, too?
So I was set up.
Somebody used me.
This thing I have...
I may have given it to other people, too?
Okay, that is not how I imagined that conversation would go.
If Stone's telling the truth, then he's a fall guy.
He was groomed, turned into a vector for the virus, and manipulated into spreading it.
Which means this all connects to Paul Reeves' investigation of the lab where the virus came from.
[Receiver clicks] Stone was deliberately infected.
The CDC confirmed that someone turned his asthma inhaler into a virus-delivery system.
The question is, who came up with that idea?
The answer has got to be connected to this lab that Paul was investigating.
I think it is.
Beckett, take a look at this.
The, uh, lab from which the virus went missing... uh, Latham Pharmaceuticals...
they're the same company that makes the vaccine that Espo and the others got.
Which is why they had samples of H5N1 in the first place.
Right, but as part of his investigation,
Paul was looking into production orders of the vaccine... specifically, this one for 10 million units of the vaccine.
Castle, there were only 1,000 reported cases of H5N1 worldwide.
So why would Latham suddenly order up 10 million vaccines?
Unless they knew that there was gonna be an outbreak.
I think Paul was asking the same question.
Ms. Jarvis, thank you for taking the time.
O-of course.
Yeah, d... have you found whoever, uh, did this to Paul?
No, not yet, but we do have a few questions.
Now, do you know why he was investigating Latham Pharmaceuticals?
It was his job.
Companies that produce vaccines with federal money are tracked by G.A.O.
And Latham developed a vaccine for a rare but deadly flu virus, didn't they?
I mean, a flu so rare that the vaccine just sits on the shelf.
Yeah, we see that a lot.
Preventive vaccines are created, but not all flu strains become widespread.
- Well, they do with a little help.
- Excuse me?
You recently converted all of your assets to Latham stock.
Why is that?
How I invest is none of your concern.
It became my concern when you tried to start an H5N1 epidemic.
Castle:
With the help of someone gullible, someone you could easily manipulate, like Jared Stone.
What on earth are you talking about?
I d...
I don't know any Jared Stone.
Your husband was one of the prosecutors who put away his girlfriend, Erin Wilson.
So when you needed a patsy, you knew just where to look.
And then your colleague Paul, when he saw that huge vaccine order, he started digging.
And when you saw that he was getting closer to the truth, you eliminated him.
That is absurd.
You can't prove any of this.
Castle:
Actually, we can.
We found the e-mails you wrote in your cloud account, under the username "White Knight."
We also arrested a Latham executive with whom you were colluding.
He admitted to his role, and he cut a deal.
And he threw you under the bus.
You could have infected and killed millions of people, Ms. Jarvis.
And for what, so you could drive a nicer car, buy a bigger house?
Was this all just because of money?
- I want a lawyer.
- You better find a good one.
Hey.
Hey.
So, I, uh...
I hear everybody's good to go.
Clean bills of health.
This time yesterday, catching the flu was the least of our problems.
You did all right down there.
I don't care what they say about transit cops.
Mm.
What they say about gold shields is even worse... mostly 'cause it's true.
We make a tight team.
Bonds forged in the heat of battle...
you know how it is.
Yeah.
I wasn't straight with you.
I have a 5-year-old son.
Uh, you said that you didn't have a family.
Why hide that?
I didn't want you worried about me being a mom down there.
[Scoffs]
You are a piece of work, Marisa.
Who's Lenny?
Or is it Lanie?
How do you know about her?
On my last tour, an I.E.D. blew out my eardrum.
Got pretty good at reading lips.
You were saying her name before you took down Stone.
Yeah, I don't...
I don't remember that.
Who you think of in that moment...
it has weight.
Don't trade what's real for something that isn't.
I'll see you around, Javi.
Well, it's not every day you come across someone who makes a suicide bomber look like the good guy.
So, I talked to the hospital.
Jared Stone will make a full recovery, though clearly his troubles aren't over yet.
Yeah, unless he goes to the same prison as Erin Wilson, because in the end, Jared Stone was driven by the most primal of emotions...
love.
Except he could have picked a better way to express it.
Hey, look who's here.
What's up?
- Beckett:
Hey!
- Hail the conquering hero!
Man, you gave me a scare.
- That's because you're a wimp.
- Oh.
Okay.
Yeah, well, I guess that makes me a wimp, too.
Oh.
Got any of that left over for me?
Javi, I was worried sick.
I thought...
I know what you thought, but I'm here.
I'm back.
I'm all right.
I hate to interrupt, but I have a brilliant idea.
How about we all go to the old haunt, huh?
Drinks on me.
Yeah.
Come on, we'll take the subway.
- Too soon?
- Too soon.
Please accept this as a token of my apology.
[Laughs] Am I on the wrong track, here?
Castle:
So, what do you think?
This feels different, doesn't it?
What does?
Rolling up to a crime scene as a married couple.
We're like nick and nora charles.
Ooh, like "mcmillan wife."
"hart to hart." "turner hooch."
Turner and hooch aren't even married.
Yeah, but you still remind me a little of hooch.
[ camera shutter clicks ]
So, uh, morning blend?
Did this just happen?
Ryan:
Yeah.
Jogger found him about an hour ago.
Lanie:
Which was about the time he died.
Needless to say, pretty obvious what killed him.
Gunshot wound to the head.
"him" being paul reeves out of queens.
We're running down next of kin.
Anyone hear the shot?
No, and there's no video coverage
In this area of the park.
The killer probably knew that.
Took reeves' phone, cash from his wallet,
And probably waltzed right out of here.
Looks like a mugging gone wrong.
Well, there's no signs of struggle.
If this was a mugging and he didn't put up a fight,
Why risk shooting him, especially in broad daylight?
Singed fabric.
Nobody heard anything because the killer used a backpack
Or cloth to muffle the shot.
And then took the victim's phone and cash
To throw us off track.
This wasn't a mugging.
This was a deliberate murder.
That just doesn't make sense.
Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Well, how much do you know about your brother's life?
Were you close?
Very close.
In fact, paul had been staying at my place
For the past month.
He was waiting to close escrow on a condo.
Was having coffee in the park something he did often?
He never went to the park.
He hardly ever left the office.
Paul was a complete workaholic.
And what did he do, exactly?
He was an investigator for the government, the g.A.O.
I don't know much more than that.
He really couldn't discuss his job.
Was he having any troubles at work that you're aware of?
Not trouble exactly, but...
Last night, we had a beer.
Paul said a crucial meeting came up
That he was worried about.
What kind of a meeting?
I mean w-with whom?
He didn't say, but he'd got a disturbing call
From someone involved in one of his cases.
And he said...
That meeting --
I think that was supposed to happen this morning.
I-i'm sorry, but if he had a meeting,
He never mentioned anything to me,
Though i suppose that wasn't unusual.
I gave him a lot of latitude.
Paul was my top investigator.
What exactly did paul investigate?
We're a federal agency.
G.A.O. Evaluates government programs and contracts
To root out waste, fraud, and abuse.
Like defense contractors billing 500 bucks for a hammer.
Yes, though paul was in the healthcare division.
He oversaw hospitals and medical services
With government contracts -- that sort of thing.
So if someone was fleecing uncle sam,
He could cancel their contracts?
He wrote reports that could produce that result, yes.
Did anyone ever pressure paul
To back off a report or investigation?
It doesn't work that way.
We're an independent body, so...
Be that as it may,
We need the files of all his active investigations.
Beckett:
Paul reeves had over 20 open cases,
And he was taking on some major players --
A hospital chain that defrauded medicare,
A-a lab at latham pharmaceuticals
Cited for lax storage practices,
And a company that sold the v.A. Defective medical equipment.
I feel the heavy hand of conspiracy.
Yeah, well, what else is new?
Consider this -- paul uncovers a nefarious scandal
Rife with corruption and financial skullduggery
In connection with a federal contract,
But with millions of dollars at stake, the greedy contractor,
Determined to stay latched onto the federal teat,
Lures paul into a meeting in the park
Where he has an assassin silence him.
Thus, paul's findings never come to light.
And i don't suppose that you have
A particular case of paul's in mind, do you?
Or proof?
Or suspects?
No, but i will once you identify who met paul at the park.
I might be a step closer to that.
Do you remember how paul's brother mentioned
That a "meeting" had just come up?
Well, i looked into paul's phone calls for the last 48 hours.
One of them stood out --
An incoming call to his office at 11:04 yesterday morning.
Call lasted less than a minute,
And i traced it to a pay phone on the lower east side.
Try and find out who made that call.
Yeah.
Tory:
This is street-cam video of the pay phone.
11:04 yesterday morning --
This is the man who called paul reeves.
Tory ran the image and got a match on his face.
Jared stone -- misdemeanor computer trespassing?
Otherwise known as hacking.
Stone was an occupy wall street activist
Who hacked into a major bank, releasing their e-mails,
Which reflected poorly on their business practices.
So why would a hacker like jared stone
Kill a g.A.O. Investigator?
He wouldn't.
That story doesn't make any sense.
But this one does.
Using his vaunted hacking skills,
Jared stone is the one who uncovered the nefarious scandal.
So we're back to a nefarious scandal?
Yes, see, he wants to blow the lid off a scandal,
So who better to call
Than intrepid investigator paul reeves?
Because -- wait for it -- jared stone is a whistle-blower.
And paul reeves was murdered
Because of what jared stone told him,
Which...
Which actually means he could be in danger now.
You have to admit, castle's theory is...
Surprisingly logical.
Yes, and it's conveniently unburdened by evidence.
Nevertheless, let's bring jared stone in for questioning,
And let's take a look at the video footage of that pay phone
For the past two weeks.
If jared stone talked to anyone, i want to know who it was.
Yo, we may have an address on jared stone.
I ran his e-mails.
He rented a place on the lower west off craigslist.
Go.
Yeah, okay.
Esposito:
So, what's going on with married life, huh?
How is that -- the whole family thing?
Sarah grace, she's -- she's growing up, changing so fast.
Just trying to hold on to every second.
Hey, what kind of dad do you think i'd be?
You'd be great.
Even growing up with no role model?
Well, you know, the thing of it is,
Is that you know what it's like not having a father.
You'd make sure your kid never felt that way.
You and lanie...
Hmm?
No.
She likes things how they are.
But, you know, maybe i'm ready for more than that,
You know what i'm saying?
Move forward.
Huh.
Hey, you hear that?
That sound?
No.
What sound?
It's my biological clock ticking.
Tick, tock, tick.
[ laughs ] [ sighs ]
We were having a genuine, honest moment here,
And you had to ruin it by being a jackass.
Hold on, hold on.
Slow down, slow down.
That's jared stone.
Hang tight here.
I'll follow him on foot, make sure we don't lose him.
[ car door opens, closes ] [ indistinct talking over p.A. ]
[ cellphone rings ] [ beep ] hey, bro.
Yeah, i followed him down to the subway.
I'm looking for him now.
What, you lost him?
No, i didn't lose him.
I just don't have visual contact.
That's kind of splitting hairs, isn't it?
Look, i-i'll head down there, and --
No, no, no.
You stay there.
I'll -- wait, i see him.
He's at my 12.
Yeah, he's moving fast.
He's scared, like someone's after him.
If someone is, you'd better get to him before they do.
Whoever killed reeves may be gunning for stone.
He's boarding the 7th ave.
Express.
[ train beeps ]
All right, i'm on the train with stone.
You're holding an uncapped marker,
And you're telling me you were not about
To tag this subway car?
Yes.
I-i mean no.
I need to see some identification.
I'm gonna have to write you up for this.
Jared stone?
Hey.
You're not in trouble, bro, but, uh...
Look, i'm just here to talk to you.
Don't!
[ gun cocks ] [ people gasp ]
Put your gun on the ground!
Now!
[ brakes squealing ] [ electricity crackles ] [ people scream ] [ air hisses ]
Put your gun on the ground now.
Do it.
Kick it over to me.
Step back.
Nobody else move.
Nobody's moving, man.
All right, i just came here to talk to you.
I'm on your side.
No, you're a blunt instrument, a tool of the one percent.
Look, nobody's hurt yet,
So this is just a big misunderstanding.
So why don't you lower that weapon,
And we can walk right out of here?
Oh, is that really possible?
It is, yeah.
You just have to put the gun down, jared.
What the hell is that?
Are you on the phone?
Everybody, shut off your phones and get the ground now!
[ beep ] javi!
Javi!
Stay down, don't move, and nobody gets hurt.
This cannot be happening.
Please, look, don't do this.
Okay?
Don't hurt my wife.
Or the rest of us.
Let's be inclusive.
Hey, everybody just stay calm, all right?
We're all gonna be fine.
Look, you're not in charge.
I am.
[ breathing heavily ]
Hey, i pulled the emergency brake.
Why hasn't the conductor come over the intercom yet?
Well, maybe he -- shh!
You feel that?
That's movement.
Like people are getting off the train, e-evacuating.
How do they know?
Who were you on the phone with?
Just a friend, man.
Oh, what kind of friend?
Was it another cop?
Was it a cop, huh?
I can hit redial if i want.
Yeah, he was a -- he was nypd, but that doesn't mean anything.
Okay, shut up.
Okay, everybody just stop talking, okay?
I got to...
Think.
He took my service weapon.
How did i let him do that?
Hey, it could happen to anybody, okay?
I'm javier, javier esposito.
Marisa aragon.
[ clears throat ] jared?
May i call you jared?
Grant gerber, salesman by trade, which means i'm a listener.
I listen and learn what people want so i can give it to them.
Let me do that for you, jared.
I want to help you get what you want.
I think you'll get your chance.
I've just been informed that jared stone,
A person of interest in the paul reeves case,
Drew a gun on a subway and took hostages,
Including detective esposito.
At this point, it's not clear why...
Hey, if anybody can handle it, espo can.
...Or what his agenda is...
But why would stone take hostages?
Right now our sole priority is to gather any
And all information on jared stone
So the hostage-rescue team
Will know who we're dealing with.
All intel comes to me so that i can forward it directly to hrt.
[ siren wails ] they should be on the scene right now.
Detective ryan?
Yes, sir.
Captain bigelow, hrt.
What's your intel on your suspect?
Sir, he's a hacker, an occupy wall street activist.
It's all sketchy.
What about your boy esposito?
Is he someone we can count on?
He's solid?
He's as solid as they get.
Roger that.
[ cellphone rings ] [ beep ]
Hey, beckett.
I'm sorry.
Kevin, no one could have seen this coming.
No, no, he's my partner.
I should have never let him go in there alone.
We got to focus on getting javi out of there,
So once you brief hrt, just head over to stone's apartment.
Leave the scene?
There's nothing that you can do that hrt isn't already doing.
And if we want to help javi out,
Then the best thing that we can do
Is find out who jared stone is and why he is doing this,
And some of those answers might be at his apartment.
Okay.
I'll check it out and let you know.
Kate, is it true -- what they're saying?
Listen, he has been in worse scrapes than this,
And we're gonna get him out of there, i promise you.
Detective beckett, dr.
Parish, we've got eyes on esposito.
Beckett:
Where's this coming from?
I didn't think the mta had cameras in the subway cars.
They don't.
The train is part of a pilot program for video security.
This is on a separate feed,
So it took me awhile to find it.
Wait, if this is on a separate feed --
That means that we can see stone, but he doesn't know that.
Which gives us a tactical edge.
I'll make sure hrt knows about this.
At least javi's not down there alone.
There's another cop with him.
Beckett:
Yeah, between the two of them,
They might be able to diffuse the situation.
[ classical music plays ]
Kind of a weird time for him to be hitting his playlist.
He's trying to calm himself down.
Because he's about to do what?
I might need you to back me up.
Can you do that?
What's your play?
Talk to him, try to get him to see the light,
Then disarm him if i get the chance.
I should talk to him.
I'm the one wearing the kevlar.
Yeah, but i've already got a rapport with the guy, so...
A bad rapport.
I know what this is.
I'm just a transit cop.
You gold-shield guys,
Always acting like you're better than us.
We are better than you.
Mr. Stone?
!
[ breathing heavily ]
Permission to speak?
Go ahead.
That is far enough.
Look, whatever went down between you and paul reeves,
This is only gonna make it worse.
This wasn't supposed to happen -- not here.
This wasn't part of the plan.
Then we can come up with a new plan --
One where you walk out of here.
You can still do that.
It's too late.
Police are already involved.
It -- i know there's no turning back.
You have to turn back, jared, 'cause if you don't, here's what's gonna happen.
Hrt -- that's the hostage rescue team --
Will wait for you to get weak and tired,
Then a dozen highly trained guys armed to the teeth
Will breach this car.
And trust me when i tell you...
They will not play.
You'll be lucky to get off one shot before they drop you.
Hrt won't come near me Not once they know i have this.
[ all gasping ]
[ beeping ]
Oh, my god, a suicide vest.
His left hand.
That's a dead man's switch.
If he lets go of that...
Clearly, jared stone is not a whistle-blower.
Beckett:
He's a terrorist wearing an explosive vest.
This was a planned attack.
I'll contact homeland, see what they have on him.
Keep working intel on jared stone.
Obviously, the man is not at all who we thought he was.
Jared, what are you doing, man?
It's kind of self-explanatory, isn't it?
Look, i know you're an activist
And you're all about taking on the one percent,
But do you see anybody like that here?
Grant:
Look, i may be a salesman,
But just so you know, i'm not a big earner.
Okay, i am barely scraping by.
Jared, these are working people -- your people.
You don't want to hurt them.
You're right.
I don't.
But i will if i have to.
Take a picture.
Text it to hrt.
Ryan:
I need you to tell me everything you know about jared stone.
Just that he wanted the apartment for two weeks,
So i rented it to him.
Did you meet the guy, talk to him?
Just when i gave him the key
And told him i did not permit wild parties.
What's this about?
All right, comb through every inch of this place.
Look through all his papers, personal items,
Anything that can tell us who jared stone is or what he's up to.
E-excuse me, gentlemen,
But could i ask you to remove your shoes?
The carpet is brand-new.
Just a thought.
Thank you.
Homeland doesn't have a file on jared stone.
Neither does nypd counter-terrorism.
Why would stone blow up the subway?
I-i-i've been reading his posts on income inequality.
He's a little pedantic, but he's an armchair revolutionary.
He's not a man of action.
Maybe he became radicalized somehow.
"the taking of pelham 123" could not have been his plan.
He must have been headed someplace else
When esposito stopped him.
Beckett:
He was.
[ receiver clicks ]
Stone was set to attend a wealth-management seminar
With 1,500 people at the tremaine hotel.
That's where he was going when esposito came along.
Gates:
The 7th avenue express
Would have taken him right there.
And if he was after one-percenters,
This seminar would be a target-rich environment.
Sir, he also had a backup target.
He had seats to an opera
At the biggest theater on broadway -- 1,900 seats.
He was going for maximum casualties,
And he's willing to kill himself in the process.
I'll pass this on to hrt.
Oh, uh, one more thing.
Tory ran video on that pay phone.
Stone did use it before.
He called the maldives last week twice.
The maldives?
Who was he talking to?
The cellphone he has is no longer active.
Can't track it down.
[ cellphone rings ] oh.
[ beep ] gates.
Hrt is asking,
"what kind of pizza does detective esposito like?"
Uh, uh, pineapple, olives, and, uh, double jalapeño, sir.
I'll pass it along.
Uh...
Pineapple...
Since when does a hacker,
Who by his very nature tends to live his life virtually,
Morph into a suicide bomber?
Stone has no history of violence.
You think something happened to trigger him?
I don't know, but there's a piece missing here somewhere.
H-how does a g.A.O. Investigator fit into this?
The calls to the maldives?
Has ryan turned anything up?
No, so far, no word.
Excuse me.
This receipt from two days ago for the shredder --
Did you buy it?
No.
I don't even know where that came from.
It really doesn't fit.
Then stone bought it.
Excuse me.
Could you...
He's shredding documents.
Okay, we need to bag this up
And take it back to the precinct,
Put it back together, find out what stone was trying to hide.
Jared:
So, how did you find me?
How did you track me down?
Do you know about white knight?
What's white knight?
[ cellphone ringing ]
[ rattling ] [ inhales deeply ]
That'll be the negotiator.
[ coughs ] [ ringing continues ]
You want something, right?
Now would be the time to ask for it.
[ beep ] hello?
Yes, i-it is.
Hello, bob.
You're the negotiator?
I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, th-th-they're all fine, too.
Uh, let me ask.
Is, uh, anybody hungry?
I'm always hungry.
So am i.
Yeah, um [sniffs] e-everybody could use
Some food right about now.
[ sniffs ] um...
Well, you do that, bob.
Demands.
Do i have demands?
Yeah.
I got one.
[ sniffs ] you listening?
I want aaron wilson released from prison.
You call me back when you have a plan to make that happen.
[ beep ]
That's all he said?
Who the hell is aaron wilson?
Well, if we want to save these people, we need to find out.
Beckett:
Okay, let's find who this aaron wilson is.
[ keyboard clacking ]
Wait a minute.
Castle, it's a woman -- e-r-i-n.
She's serving seven years in federal prison
For felony computer trespassing.
So she's a hacker, too.
Court records show that she hacked a database
At the new york federal reserve,
Looking for proof that the fed colluded with the big banks.
What's her connection to stone?
It looks like jared stone was an accomplice,
But the u.S. Attorney didn't have enough to charge him.
So they were partners in crime.
Erin went to prison, stone didn't.
That's why he wants to get her out.
He feels guilty.
That would also explain the maldives.
What do you mean?
It's a non-extradition country.
Hey, guys, you need to see this.
What was in that shredder was about two pages of text.
So far, we've been able to assemble a few random words,
Like "monitor" and "surveillance."
Okay, what do you think it is?
It's some kind of letter,
But i don't think that stone was the one who wrote it.
Take a look at this phrase that we assembled just now.
"read, memorize, and then destroy"?
It's not like he would write that to himself.
So they're instructions.
Now we know stone is working with other people.
Maybe this is all about erin wilson.
Maybe she's the one behind all this.
Castle and i will look into erin wilson and dig deeper,
And we'll also see if we can identify any associates
That jared might have had.
Ryan:
We'll keep piecing this together here.
Guys, everyone down there is counting on us.
Esposito:
Hey.
Who's erin wilson?
[ sniffs ]
She's my soul mate.
[ coughs ] well, why not give bob more to go on
So he knew who you were talking about?
I want to keep him off-balance, maintain control.
You get that tip off the internet?
'cause it's not a very good one.
[ inhales deeply ]
What's white knight?
[ cellphone ringing ] [ inhales deeply ]
[ beep ]
Tell me your plan for erin.
What the hell is taking so long, bob?
Getting her in prison didn't seem to take any time at all!
D-- bob, shut up!
Shut up!
Listen to me.
I want her flown to the maldives.
Yeah, well, i'm telling you now, bob.
[ sniffs ] okay.
I want her flown to the maldives,
And in half an hour, i want your plan on how to make that happen.
Are we clear?
[ sniffs, breathing shakily ]
Yeah, bob, food would be great right about now.
No.
Don't send any cops.
I don't care if they're unarmed, bob!
I don't want any police near this car!
Just drop the food!
Then set it on the edge of the platform!
I'll send somebody to get it.
[ beep ]
You, the husband, go.
Get the food.
I know you'll come back.
I just got bad news.
I called the prison and spoke to erin wilson.
And?
She's stone's girlfriend, but she didn't seem to know
About his plan to break her out until just now.
What about you?
Anything on stone's known associates?
Stone may have lived online, but he wasn't very social.
He started a "free erin wilson" website
But didn't seem to interact with any other users.
He had to have interacted with somebody.
Tech scrubbed his computer and found a hidden directory
That they think contained private correspondence.
From whom?
The contents were thoroughly erased.
The only thing that was left
Was the name of the directory -- "white knight."
Ty:
Okay, who's next?
We got double cheese, pepperoni, mushroom.
Uh, right here.
Thanks.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Veggie with eggplant and garlic.
Pineapple, olives, double jalapeño.
That's for me.
Really?
We're trapped in a subway car.
I'm not sure you should eat that.
[ coughs ]
Marisa:
You gonna eat that thing, or just gaze at it in wonder?
I don't understand.
Why does hrt want to breach?
In their assessment, stone is trapped,
With no good options and no way to carry out his original plan.
They believe the longer this goes,
The more likely he will do the unthinkable.
Well, why not see how things play out with erin wilson?
Hrt thinks the erin wilson demand is a ruse,
Stone is playing this card to buy time, work up his nerve.
If they bust in, what'll keep stone from blowing that vest?
Esposito will.
He's in on it.
Won't stone see hrt coming?
Yes, if they approach via the tunnel,
But they're dropping onto the train from above,
Through the subway grates.
When?
Soon.
Any moment now.
You sure we shouldn't tell the others?
No.
They'll get nervous, and stone will pick up on it.
Hey, why did you become a cop?
I got out of the army.
It's what made the most sense.
Me too.
You miss the service?
Some parts.
Not others.
Married?
Kids?
No.
Don't do this, okay?
Don't try to take my mind off of what's coming.
I don't need anyone holding my hand.
You know, you got a chip on your shoulder
The size of stonehenge.
I was just trying to get to know you a little bit.
Oh.
[ electricity buzzes ]
You see that?
Sure did.
The next flicker is go time.
You clear on the plan?
Don't worry about me.
[ inhales deeply ]
I can feel vibrations.
They're on the train.
[ electricity buzzes ]
[ dialing ] [ beep ]
You pull your people back now or everybody dies.
Now!
I know they're here!
Don't screw with me, bob,
Or i will pull my hand off this trigger right now!
How am i supposed to trust they're gone, huh?
You just tried to send storm troopers
Into a subway car full of people,
Not knowing where they are or where i am... [ beep ]
Wait a second.
Beckett:
Don't worry.
He's gonna be okay.
I know.
I know.
How is she?
[ sighs ]
Well, at least when she could see javi, she knew he was okay.
We'll get espo back.
The key is finding out who stone was working with.
The answer's probably in that white knight directory.
But so far, but tech hasn't been able to recover any of the data.
Well, then, we'll revisit the victim.
Looking into paul reeve's investigations
Is what led us to stone.
Perhaps it'll lead us to the others, as well.
Yeah.
Tory, let me ask you something.
Uh, t-the video from the subway --
Before it cut out, did you record it?
Of course.
All streaming video is archived automatically.
Why?
Could you show it to me?
There's something i'd like to see.
[ keyboard clacking ]
These are all 20 of the case files
Paul reeves was working on.
Here's just a summary of those cases.
I figure we just go through these
Until something points to stone or to erin wilson
Or anything else we're dealing with.
Okay.
I'll start.
Uh, the first one is that pharmaceutical lab
Cited for losing samples of a flu virus.
Not ringing any bells.
Moving on to a medical chain
That knowingly implanted defective artificial hips.
Hey, guys, that document -- i think it's a playbook.
Stone's following it to the letter.
Take a look at this sentence fragment.
"demand erin wilson's release from prison, then hang up."
More instructions?
I mean, how is that telling us anything we don't already know?
You'll see.
[ beep ] now take a look at this one.
"and demand erin be flown to a non-extradition country."
But that instruction comes later on in the document,
Which is exactly how stone played it.
First, he demanded her release,
And then he brought up the maldives.
That doesn't make any sense.
If stone wanted erin wilson freed from prison,
Then why would he wait to mention the maldives until later?
For the same reason he asked about erin wilson's release
Without explaining who she was.
Stone is stalling.
He's playing for time.
Something else is going on here, something big.
Kate, i need to show you something.
I noticed something when i was watching earlier,
So i went to watch this whole video.
We have a problem -- a new problem.
[ beep ] [ sighs ] this is stone
Back when he was just holding them all hostage.
This is him later...
And later.
Castle:
His asthma's getting worse.
It's not just his asthma.
It looks like he has fever and chills.
It's only a matter of time before he's not able to think clearly.
The man is sick,
And he's getting sicker with flu-like symptoms.
Flu-like symptoms?
Uh, castle, that case.
Paul reeves was investigating a missing flu virus.
This is all connected somehow.
It has to be.
Once i hear that she's in international airspace,
I'll surrender.
[ coughs ] [ sniffs, inhales deeply ] [ inhales deeply ] [ sighs ]
Because i'm giving you my word.
Stone's not looking too good.
Hey, exactly how long is that gonna take, huh?
If he passes out and releases that switch, we're all dead.
We got to make a move.
Bob, bob, bob, that's...
The same plan as before?
That's not acceptable.
Yeah.
[ sighs ] when?
He gets distracted when he puffs on his inhaler.
Next puff, we go.
Look, those are my conditions.
Once i hear from erin that she's free,
I swear, i'll let everybody go.
[ beep ] [ sighs ] don't worry, everyone.
It's almost over.
[ inhales deeply ] [ all gasping ]
No, stop!
Please!
Secure the switch.
I'm not done yet!
I'm not done yet!
Go, go, go, go.
Good job.
[ all sigh ]
[ dialing ] [ beep ] hey, javi.
Esposito:
What's up?
We took down stone.
Nobody's hurt.
Everybody's fine.
It's over.
It's not over, man.
What?
What do you mean, it's not over?
I don't want a ticker-tape parade or anything like that,
But did you not just hear what i said?
Listen, javi.
This is about more than a suicide vest.
The cdc turned up a lethal variant of the h5n1 virus
In stone's apartment.
It's a hot zone.
Stone's infected And everyone around him might be, too.
I got the door open!
I got it!
Close that door!
I said close it now!
Nobody leaves the train!
Sir, how is esposito?
Well, he and the others were transported to the hospital,
But they're in isolation.
What's the prognosis?
Well, this particular strain of h5n1 is lethal
And can be spread through airborne contact.
But there is a vaccine.
It's been given to the passengers,
And it can knock down the virus even after exposure.
So he's gonna be okay?
Doctors are optimistic.
And the cdc is retracing stone's steps
To identify who else he was in contact with.
This guy's like an evil version of typhoid mary.
The suicide vest, the demands --
All about exposing people
Long enough to get them infected so they'd spread the virus.
Well, it could have been far worse
If he had made it to that seminar or the opera.
In proximity to all those people,
He could have caused an epidemic.
But i-i-i'm still not clear.
How does our shooting victim fit into all this?
Paul reeves was investigating the lab
Where a sample of h5n1 went missing.
We think he figured out that stone had stolen the virus,
Which is why stone lured him into the park and killed him.
Beckett:
But, sir, there are still questions,
Like who stone was working with
And why he did this in the first place,
So we need to go and talk to him.
Well, you better hurry up
Because i hear he's not in good shape.
Yes, sir.
[ monitor beeping ] [ coughing ]
You're not the priest.
No, but i can take your confession.
We know you had help, mr.
Stone.
White knight -- who is he?
[ sighs ]
Someone i met through the "free erin" site
A few months back.
What was his real name?
I don't know.
We bonded over erin...
Over how to get her out.
He was a strategic thinker.
I wasn't, so he helped me with the plan.
I never would have detonated that vest.
I just -- i just needed some leverage.
I love erin.
All i wanted was to see her free.
More like you wanted to get people sick.
What do you mean?
You tried to start an epidemic
By spreading your deadly virus.
Erin was just a sideshow.
What are you talking about?
The opera, the seminar --
Hundreds of one-percenters in close proximity.
That was the perfect environment to spread your disease.
It -- disease?
No, i -- i was trying to find the best spot
To take my stand for erin.
Then why did you call paul reeves?
White knight s-said that it was part of the plan.
I-i...
Called reeves to tell him about some meeting at the park.
I didn't even know who he was.
The seminar and the opera --
Were those white knight's ideas, too?
So i was set up.
Somebody used me.
This thing i have --
I may have given it to other people, too?
Okay, that is not how i imagined that conversation would go.
If stone's telling the truth, then he's a fall guy.
He was groomed, turned into a vector for the virus,
And manipulated into spreading it.
Which means this all connects to paul reeves' investigation
Of the lab where the virus came from.
[ receiver clicks ] stone was deliberately infected.
The cdc confirmed that someone turned his asthma inhaler
Into a virus-delivery system.
The question is, who came up with that idea?
The answer has got to be connected
To this lab that paul was investigating.
I think it is.
Beckett, take a look at this.
The, uh, lab from which the virus went missing --
Uh, latham pharmaceuticals -- they're the same company
That makes the vaccine that espo and the others got.
Which is why they had samples of h5n1 in the first place.
Right, but as part of his investigation,
Paul was looking into production orders of the vaccine --
Specifically, this one for 10 million units of the vaccine.
Castle, there were only 1,000 reported cases
Of h5n1 worldwide.
So why would latham suddenly order up 10 million vaccines?
Unless they knew that there was gonna be an outbreak.
I think paul was asking the same question.
Ms. Jarvis, thank you for taking the time.
O-of course.
Yeah, d-- have you found whoever, uh, did this to paul?
No, not yet, but we do have a few questions.
Now, do you know
Why he was investigating latham pharmaceuticals?
It was his job.
Companies that produce vaccines with federal money
Are tracked by g.A.O.
And latham developed a vaccine
For a rare but deadly flu virus, didn't they?
I mean, a flu so rare
That the vaccine just sits on the shelf.
Yeah, we see that a lot.
Preventive vaccines are created,
But not all flu strains become widespread.
Well, they do with a little help.
Excuse me?
You recently converted all of your assets to latham stock.
Why is that?
How i invest is none of your concern.
It became my concern when you tried to start an h5n1 epidemic.
Castle:
With the help of someone gullible,
Someone you could easily manipulate, like jared stone.
What on earth are you talking about?
I d-- i don't know any jared stone.
Your husband was one of the prosecutors
Who put away his girlfriend, erin wilson.
So when you needed a patsy, you knew just where to look.
And then your colleague paul,
When he saw that huge vaccine order, he started digging.
And when you saw that he was getting closer to the truth,
You eliminated him.
That is absurd.
You can't prove any of this.
Castle:
Actually, we can.
We found the e-mails you wrote in your cloud account,
Under the username "white knight."
We also arrested a latham executive
With whom you were colluding.
He admitted to his role, and he cut a deal.
And he threw you under the bus.
You could have infected
And killed millions of people, ms.
Jarvis.
And for what,
So you could drive a nicer car, buy a bigger house?
Was this all just because of money?
I want a lawyer.
You better find a good one.
Hey.
Hey.
So, i, uh -- i hear everybody's good to go.
Clean bills of health.
This time yesterday,
Catching the flu was the least of our problems.
You did all right down there.
I don't care what they say about transit cops.
Mm.
What they say about gold shields is even worse --
Mostly 'cause it's true.
We make a tight team.
Bonds forged in the heat of battle -- you know how it is.
Yeah.
I wasn't straight with you.
I have a 5-year-old son.
Uh, you said that you didn't have a family.
Why hide that?
I didn't want you worried about me being a mom down there.
[ scoffs ]
You are a piece of work, marisa.
Who's lenny?
Or is it lanie?
How do you know about her?
On my last tour, an i.E.D. Blew out my eardrum.
Got pretty good at reading lips.
You were saying her name before you took down stone.
Yeah, i don't -- i don't remember that.
Who you think of in that moment -- it has weight.
Don't trade what's real for something that isn't.
I'll see you around, javi.
Well, it's not every day you come across someone
Who makes a suicide bomber look like the good guy.
So, i talked to the hospital.
Jared stone will make a full recovery,
Though clearly his troubles aren't over yet.
Yeah, unless he goes to the same prison as erin wilson,
Because in the end, jared stone was driven
By the most primal of emotions -- love.
Except he could have picked a better way to express it.
Hey, look who's here.
What's up?
Beckett:
Hey!
Hail the conquering hero!
Man, you gave me a scare.
That's because you're a wimp.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah, well, i guess that makes me a wimp, too.
Oh.
Got any of that left over for me?
Javi, i was worried sick.
I thought --
I know what you thought, but i'm here.
I'm back.
I'm all right.
I hate to interrupt, but i have a brilliant idea.
How about we all go to the old haunt, huh?
Drinks on me.
Yeah.
Come on, we'll take the subway.
Too soon?
Too soon.
Please accept this as a token of my apology.
[ laughs ] am i on the wrong track, here?
Episode 12
Episode 11
Brutus.
My liege.
Are you certain you do not need me by your side?
You are the only one I can trust.
would we?
A report has come in from Admiral Magellan.
It seems you intend to start a war without me.
Why do you think that?
How many years have I served you?
My liege would think now is the most opportune time to strike the Oda.
I cannot deceive you.
It is just as you said.
Nobunaga's page was the girl Sir da Vinci took from Domrémy village.
Domrémy?
Then it's that...
That's right.
known for hearing the voice of Heaven.
One wonders what exactly she's heard...
Sir da Vinci planned this from the start.
we cannot let the Oda do as they please.
I must teach them what happens to those who anger me.
few nations have so many Giant War Armors.
they all bear Regalia.
We could say that they are an exceptional war asset.
The surrounding nations will tremble just from hearing Oda's name!
Hideyoshi.
What?
Why not?
Fear also invites caution.
Expecting peace is naïve.
But because of these nations are seeking to become allies with us in droves.
but...
As Nobunaga said the addition of Goku had grown Oda's military might to rival that of a large nation.
Regalia-enhanced Giant War Armors can match a thousand enemies.
normal Giant War Armors are powerless.
For that reason
Owari's neighboring nations were faced with a decision:
enter an alliance with Nobunaga or go to war while they still could.
My concern is Caesar.
I find it implausible that he would step aside for long.
He will come soon enough.
If I were him
I would come to crush us before we gain experience in using Giant War Armors in battle.
And I would use all my power.
are we making good progress on the evacuation of our people?
it is nearly complete.
They took a lot of persuading.
But even if the city burns the nation will survive.
I will welcome them onto my ship.
That would be a great help.
I'm counting on you.
Your will is my command!
That will not be necessary.
Orléans' Regalia of protection is an impenetrable defense.
I will not let them lay a finger on the people.
Oh?
Ranmaru.
In any case
I am not so certain about relying on your Orléans alone...
What?
!
Then perhaps we can seek guidance from the cards?
What an ominous card.
All things have a beginning and an end a life... and a death.
Death...
There is a time limit to the Giant War Armor's operation.
if you activate the Regalia beyond its capacity you will cause the Giant War Armor to overheat.
That would be like inviting Death himself to your doorstep.
though.
No... the heavier the controls feel.
Is that what you called over... over... over-what?
Overheating.
Overheating.
I see.
You cannot protect people through rash action.
In the current circumstance the failure of one may destroy the strategy of all involved.
I will not be defeated by death!
even if it costs me my life!
Your resolve is commendable.
is that you?
Everything flows without cease carried as if by a river's flow.
there will be unrest on the Star of the East.
What manner of man will come sit with us at the Round Table?
I can hardly wait.
{Your Majesty the }Savior-King.
Arthur's words soon came to pass.
Caesar's forces invaded Nobunaga's Owari.
A...
Alas...
Retreat!
Retreat!
Nobuhide-sama!
Hayashi-dono and Shibata-dono have both died in battle.
They died with honor as warriors.
The enemy has currently stationed two War Armor battalions on the mountains to the north two War Armor battalions and one Giant War Armor unit in the forests to the west and three War Armor battalions with three Giant War Armors
which we believe to be their main encampment.
they have twelve ships along the lakeshore before us.
Mitsu?
We are completely surrounded.
Caesar must intend to exterminate the Oda.
I thought that fop was only good at cheap tricks and underestimated him but this is a pretty grand strategy for storming a castle.
all of your men are in position.
All right.
Seek Nobunaga's head!
attack!
The die has been cast!
A clash of the titans.
Are our people safe?
They are fine.
Ichihime-sama directed the evacuation herself.
Caesar's main force have begun their advance!
The enemy has us outnumbered.
with no exit path.
Nobu?
Ranmaru!
Monkey!
We're going out there with our Giant War Armors!
ruler of Owari!
Do not let cannon fire cease!
Engulf the Oda with a sea of fire!
I will protect this nation!
who gave you permission to disembark?
!
Toyotomi Hideyoshi!
Here I come!
Tea's ready!
as well?
Oda's Giant War Armors may be blowing steam right about now.
Make sure Orléans cools down!
You!
Don't throw water on the heat dispersal unit!
You'll get a vapor explosion!
Wow.
It's like a sauna.
How's maintenance on the Armors going?
Please wait a while.
We are having some difficulty dispersing the internal heat buildup.
Please eat your fill.
Don't rush.
Line up.
There's still a lot left!
Here.
Thank you.
What's this?
wouldn't you say?
We're broadcasting live from the Amenotorifune.
It was Mitsuhide-dono's idea.
This allows us to accurately track what's happening on the battlefield.
you could charge people for this view!
Caesar might make his move soon.
Yeah.
He'd wait until our units overheated then deploy his Quo Vadis.
After the afternoon battle our Giant War Armors' operational time limit has decreased considerably.
We'll have to end it quickly.
His spear of light's a problem.
Da Vinci-dono and I made a discovery about it during our analysis.
His spear of light is indeed powerful.
he cannot fire it in succession at full strength.
Once he uses the weapon he'll need time to recharge it.
So he's vulnerable then.
Right.
So we'll first lure Caesar in and have him fire his spear of light.
Ranmaru's Orléans will deflect it.
Before Caesar can fire a second time
Nobu and Hideyoshi will attack.
But will it go as we've planned?
as well.
Me?
Nobunaga... it is time to end this.
let us begin this delightful banquet.
Here he comes.
Nobu!
Caesar's on the move!
Ranmaru!
Monkey!
Let's go!
Understood!
Okay!
The general himself has finally come.
Nobunaga!
Caesar!
It's time to pay you back for my humiliation at Takamagahara!
He took the bait!
I will be victorious!
Hideyoshi!
All right!
We were waiting for this!
Not yet.
dragons.
What?
!
It's recharging so slowly...
Maintain altitude while staying out of enemy fire range.
Understood.
Draw as much ley line energy into the condenser as it can handle!
Don't let it flow to Caesar's Giant War Armor!
Your Highness.
It worked.
You interfered with the ley lines?
!
Caesar!
What?
Monkey!
Got it!
Apologize to Dad and Lord Shingen in the afterlife!
Defeated?
Me?
Here?
Nay!
This cannot be!
What's this?
This is the end!
Power!
Gaius Julius Caesar!
What?
!
Goddess!
Quo Vadis!
The dragon responded to Caesar's wish!
the quantum condenser's readings are at abnormally high levels!
What is about to happen?
!
My betrothed...
Star of the East!
I see you will lend me your power!
My power...?
!
Damn!
Veni vidi
vici!
Condemnation!
Nobu?
!
What is this?
!
My betrothed?
!
Don't!
No!
Ranmaru!
Nobu-sama!
No!
Die!
Die!
Die lots!
Die even more!
Die and die again!
are you hurt?
No...
What about you all?
We are fine.
please.
But I tried to protect them!
It's... just like that card...
I am Death!
I was supposed to be the one to draw the card.
You are not Death.
I am.
Nobunaga!
You were already skilled at stabbing others in the back.
You could kill two with one blow right now.
I do not find it shameful to attack from behind.
But
I dislike killing women.
Mademoiselle Jeanne Kaguya d'Arc of Domrémy.
Oda Nobunaga.
Further strife would be meaningless.
Submit to me.
What is your response?
Do Western warlords drink tea?
What?
Tea... you say?
come along.
I'll invite you to a tea party.
What?
!
And I'll settle the score with you
Caesar!
Yet another flower has fallen.
Time continues on and the flower remains adrift in the flow.
Next time:
The Fool.
May this song reach him.
So, uh, we have, uh, been together for, um, three years.
Four.
See, this is, uh, specifically what I am talking about.
I'm just correcting you.
Okay.
Uh, four years.
It was three years, 11 months, two days-- exactly.
You done?
Detective Williams asked you a question.
When?
He asked if you were going to allow him to finish his thought.
I'm-I'm...
Whose side are you on?
I don't take sides, Commander.
I'm an objective observer.
As you know, the governor asked me to oversee the annual psychological audit of personnel, and I was concerned by what Detective Williams had to say.
Thank you.
Okay.
Yeah, fine.
So, we, uh, we don't...
we don't agree on a few things, but I don't see why that's such a big deal.
Um, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go ahead and stop.
"A few things." What?
A few things?
We don't agree on anything.
Okay, name one.
Okay.
Um, I never get to drive my own automobile.
And I don't understand why you're angry about that.
I mean, I'd think you'd be grateful for being driven around.
He gets driven around all day, every day.
Who am I?
Miss Daisy?
Sometimes I like to drive my own car.
Sometimes you do drive.
Sometimes?
Are you saying that with a straight face in front of this woman?
I...
Do I...
Do you never drive your own car?
I don't always drive your car.
No.
I get to drive my own car when you're not in it.
When I'm alone, I get to drive my own car.
Yeah.
That's sometimes.
Okay, you know what?
Okay, fine.
You want to know why you spend so much time in the passenger seat?
Do you want to know?
This should be fanta...
Yes, of course I want to know.
I get carsick if I don't drive.
And he laughs.
And he laughs-- first time I've told him that.
'Cause it's ridiculous.
'Cause it's ridiculous, okay?
He's a control freak.
He's a gigantic control freak.
It has nothing to do with motion, trust me, please.
Well, Detective Williams.
Yeah.
Commander McGarrett is sharing something very personal with you.
Perhaps you could show him a little respect.
But he's lying.
I'm not lying.
He's a Navy SEAL.
So what?
What does that got to do with it?
Okay, okay.
What does that got to do with it?
Please stop.
I don't really want to be here, respectfully.
I'm sure he doesn't either.
But if you're not gonna be honest,
I'm gonna leave.
I'm being honest.
- Gentlemen.
- Yes.
This is a mandated review.
Mm-hmm.
So let's continue, shall we?
Fine with me.
Yeah.
It's good.
Why don't we shift gears a bit.
All right.
Describe how you two first met.
Hands up!
Don't move!
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am Detective Danny Williams.
Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett.
This my father's house.
Put your weapon down right now.
No, you put your weapon down and show me your I.D.!
You show me your I.D., right now!
I'm not putting my gun down.
Neither am I.
Four years ago...
Governor Jameson asked me to start a, uh, major crimes task force.
And Danno...
I'm gonna stop...
You see, he knows that I don't like that.
You're right.
Excuse me, Sir Daniel.
Th-This... is going right off the rails...
Okay, okay.
Come on, come on.
I'm teasing, all right?
Right after I started the task force,
Detective Danny Williams was my first hire.
You got no choice, Detective.
Governor gave me jurisdiction on making you my partner.
We're gonna get along great.
Right.
I personally wouldn't call it, um, a "hire."
It was more like a kidnapping.
A ransom.
It's the kind of thing, I didn't have a choice.
I liked his sense of humor.
You know, his personality.
You're right.
I don't like you.
When you're getting shot at, it is nice to reflect on what a nut job this guy is.
Tell me about the others.
Well, after Danny signed on, we recruited Chin Ho Kelly.
I can't be a cop anymore.
I'm the last person the department wants to see wearing a badge.
He was fired from the HPD at the time.
That's right, but we straightened that out.
Yeah, and then, uh, Kono Kalakaua-- that's Chin's cousin-- she was next.
I'mtoldshewasn'teven a police officer at the time.
So your cousin tells us you're graduating from the police academy next week.
How'd you like to earn a little extra credit before you do?
Yeah, she was a few weeks away from graduating from the academy.
But, uh, we needed a female, you see?
And she fit the bill.
And just recently, we recruited a former HPD SWAT commander named Lou Grover, from Chicago.
We want you to join Five-O.
So five people make up the Five-O task force?
Yeah, but we're, uh... we're more than a task force, you see.
W-We're 'ohana.
Why the look, Detective Williams?
Oh, no, n-no look.
Um, I guess I was just, uh, agreeing with him... for the first time.
I think we're good.
You're doing great, honey.
Keep going.
Keep going.
I can't.
Come on, just a few more steps.
The view...
it's fantastic.
Hey, now.
You haven't turned around once.
Well, what can I say?
I've got the best scenery right here.
Well, this "scenery" is gonna need an afternoon at the spa after this.
Deal.
Now hustle;
we're almost there.
Trust me, you're gonna love what you see.
Race ya?
You're on.
What is that?

Aren't you gonna rinse off?
I'd rather watch you.
Get over here.
You take such good care of me.
Have you thought any more about what we talked about?
Ugh, I'm sorry.
Hey, it's okay.
You got to take it, right?
Yeah.
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm on my way.
Adam...
Hey... don't ever apologize for doing your job, okay?
Go.
I'll take the boards home.
Okay.
All right.
I'll see you later.
I'm heading to a crime scene.
Diamond Head trail.
In case you lose me.
What do we got, Lou?
Two dead.
Name of Todd Sands and Tracy Powell.
Both schoolteachers on the mainland.
I found this on the male Vic.
Apparently, he was looking for a romantic spot to pop the question.
Any witnesses?
Just the birds.
These are 7.62 rounds.
This is military issue.
Mahalo, Commander McGarrett.
You saved me a trip to ballistics.
You're welcome, Max.
What do we got on the victims?
They appear to have been shot in close proximity.
How close?
Dr. Shaw, care to opine?
Well, based on several identifiers, including multiple through-and-throughs,
I'd estimate ten to 15 feet, with a trajectory of approximately 45 degrees.
All right, who's your friend, Max?
This is Dr. Shaw.
She's a recent graduate of Johns Hopkins University.
I will be mentoring her in the medical arts.
Oh.
Well, lucky you.
You must be Detective Williams.
Yeah.
I have given her the full heads up.
You gave her the heads up on what?
It's all true.
I'm Steve McGarrett.
Welcome aboard, Dr. Shaw.
Nice to be aboard.
Okay, I don't get it.
So, if they were attacked at close range, what are we looking at here?
Very fit mugger with a serious automatic weapon?
Well, that would be a sound theory, except for I found both wallets, rental car keys and jewelry in their backpacks.
Maybe it was personal.
Perp knew they were climbing, was waiting for them at the top.
What do you got there, Danny?
Think we found our shooter.
You ever see anything like that before?
It's a UCAV.
A combat drone.
So what are you saying?
A machine did this?
Not on its own.
Someone, somewhere, pulled the trigger.
What are you guys doing here?
You first.
I'm on surveillance.
How'd you find me?
Your mother's car has an anti-theft device.
Technology's not my friend.
Get in before you blow my cover.
No, no.
Wait.
I got it.
That's very 1988.
Okay, Jerry, I know I'm gonna regret asking this, but what is it that you are surveilling?
What you two should be keeping an eye on.
Ah, good point.
Girls in spandex.
Next door over.
Vintage books.
What about it?
Two weeks ago, the owner came back from a trip to Dusseldorf, where he purchased the entire inventory of a library that was closing down.
Get out of here.
Well, let's go arrest this guy.
What are we doing?
Not so fast, McGruff.
He hasn't committed a crime yet, but he's gonna-- trust me.
Okay, how do you know that?
That library in Dusseldorf was ancient.
And the books inside it were period.
The paper in those books-- 75% cotton, 25% ultrafine linen.
You know what that means?
I do.
It makes for good counterfeiting stock.
You, sir, are going to the head of the class.
Just 'cause he bought the books, it doesn't mean he's gonna recycle the paper and start printing bills, all right?
What else is he gonna do with them?
I don't know, maybe the vintage bookshop owner is-is gonna sell them.
No one reads hard-copy books anymore-- even I know that.
Jerry, you might be onto something here, okay?
But you can't be doing this.
You're a civilian.
I'm a seeker of truth.
You are also a, uh, conspiracy theorist, who still lives with his mother and has yet to file a tax return.
Listen to me, call the HPD;
they can handle this.
I did call the HPD.
They treated me like I was some sort of nut job.
That's... shocking.
Jerry, I'll help you dig into this,
I promise, all right?
But right now, we need your help.
Take a look at this.
Whoa, not here.
We're too exposed.
What is that?
Where was this taken?
Here, on Oahu.
This thing was used in an attack this morning.
Left two people dead.
I've seen drones before, but I've never seen anything like that.
I reached out to my military contacts, but they wouldn't disclose much information due to operational security.
So I figured maybe you could help.
Okay, I'm pretty sure what we're looking at is a prototype domestic surveillance drone.
Minus the evil aftermarket weaponized payload, of course.
The government has been denying use of domestic drones for a very long time, all right?
That's why you hit a brick wall with the military.
Think they're gonna admit to violating your right to privacy?
Better chance of getting a backstage pass at Area 51.
Okay, what about a manufacturer?
Any ideas?
I seem to recall some chatter about a drone coming out of a super-secret advanced development program-- a branch of a local military contractor named VenPax Systems.
It could be your manufacturer.
Obviously, you didn't get that from me.
Obviously.
I'd like to help you guys out, but the truth is I can neither confirm nor deny that this particular UAV belongs to us.
You can't?
No.
Okay, well, maybe you can, uh, "confirm or deny"
that these people are dead.
Did you know them?
No.
Todd Sands and Tracy Powell-- they were here on vacation.
They got here on Monday, they went to a luau, and they did a tour of Waimea Falls Park.
And now they're dead, and I want to know why.
Look, you have to understand that this project is a matter of national security, so I can't just answer your questions without compromising what we're doing here.
And you have to understand, if you don't answer our questions, the only thing you're gonna be compromising is your freedom.
Commander, we're under contract by the military.
That means that we operate under their level of security.
So threatening me isn't gonna work.
Book him, Danno.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you hear what I just said?
Yeah, loud and clear.
Put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest for obstruction, withholding information, and impeding a murder investigation.
None of that's gonna stick, and you know it.
True.
But how many more government contracts do you think you're gonna get after a background check shows an arrest on your record?
Let's go.
Okay.
Okay.
All right, this is QV-901.
It's a surveillance drone with no other payload, which means it flies unarmed.
Three weeks ago, while it was on a routine test flight, it was hijacked, never recovered.
How do you hijack a drone?
GPS spoofing.
Somebody jammed VenPax's control signal to the UAV, fed it false GPS data, and made it land wherever the hijacker wanted it.
Okay, so what are we looking at here?
Inside job?
Security breach?
We don't know yet.
Uh, VenPax gave us a list of all their current and ex-employees that had clearance on the project, so we should run their names against the victims, see if we come up with a connection.
Right, and if we find one, that might explain motive.
I'll tell you something, takes a special kind of brilliance to hijack a drone, arm it and reprogram it.
We are dealing with one very smart, very sick son of a bitch.
Same drone that attacked our hikers this morning.
Witnesses say that it flew in, hovered, gathering a crowd, and then bang, opens fire.
Ten seconds later, we got five dead, 19 wounded.
Chin Ho and Kono are running I.D.'s right now to see if they can make any connection between the victims of both attacks.
One of my guys got a few shots off at the drone, trying to bring it down.
Bystander caught it on video.
That's good shooting.
If he had missed, more people would've been dead.
We can't find any correlation between the Kuhio Beach and the Diamond Head victims.
Which means the targets could be random.
All right, we need to start looking at this as an act of terrorism.
Except for the fact that no group or individual has claimed responsibility.
Well, maybe they're not done yet.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you're all here.
I got some more Intel on that drone you're looking for.
But first, a disclaimer.
Whatever I share with you today is in no way connected to me, my family or anyone I know.
I'm strictly here on a tour of the palace, nothing more.
Any attempt to associate me with the information I'm about to share will be vehemently denied by myself and the attorney I will retain.
Are we understood?
D-Do we...
Should we sign something, everybody?
Or just, "Get on with it,"
will that suffice, Jerry?
You're so naive about how this world really works.
Jerry, we get it.
Get on with it.
What do you got?
As far as drones go, they may be state-of-the-art, but the technology is still incredibly immature.
They are severely limited by a whole heap of engineering issues, such as an unprotected frequency band.
There's just not enough spectrum to go around.
Okay.
What does that mean in the language the rest of us speak?
It means that you can buy all the equipment you need to hijack a drone at your local hardware store.
You can?
Oh, good.
Well, then, um...
Go ahead.
That should cover it.
Go ahead.
Okay, not so fast, Donald Trump.
I can jack this thing from your shooter.
Only problem is, got to be within 200 yards from the drone to tap into the frequency.
Okay, so what you're saying is there's nothing we can do until it attacks again.
we have to be there when it attacks again.
Sarge, some guy just called claiming he's responsible for the drone attacks.
How do we know it's real?
He knew details we haven't released to the public.
Said he's gonna call back in ten minutes and wants to speak to someone in charge.
Patch him through to McGarrett.
Chin, run a trace.
We're on it.
Almost there.
Come on, Chin.
Come on, come on, Chin.
Come on, come on.
Almost there, almost there.
Almost there, almost there.
All right, go.
This is Steve McGarrett.
Who am I talking to?
You're going to have to do much better than that, Steve.
Oh, you think this is funny?
Seven people are dead, and there's a lot more in the hospital.
On the contrary, I think it's a tragedy.
But it's nothing compared to the hundreds killed by your drone attacks in the Middle East.
You're comparing sworn enemies of the United States to innocent civilians.
There were plenty of innocents killed in those attacks, too,
Commander McGarrett.
You of all people should know that.
So that's what this is about for you?
Revenge?
Is that right?
Justice.
Justice?
You want our government to apologize for keeping us safe?
No.
We are way past apologies.
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
So you're saying this isn't over?
Not by a long shot.
Okay, hold on.
Just hold on a second.
Wait.
Expect more blood in two hours.
Tell me you got that.
No.
He must have bounced that call off a dozen different relay stations and satellites.
Lou, call the HPD.
Tell them the island is under siege.
We need to get everybody off the streets right now.
The governor is asking everyone to remain indoors, away from windows and do not venture outside until further notice.
Now let's go through what we know right now.
A weaponized drone opened attack in Waikiki...
Let's go, let's go, everyone!
Let's go!
We got to get indoors!
Keep your keikis close!
Everyone get indoors!
Let's go, let's go, everyone!
Keep your keikis close!
Danno, what's going on?
Doesn't matter what's going on, all right?
Go inside, listen to your coaches, do as they say, and I will call you as soon as I can, all right?
All right, I love you.
Love you, too.
We need everyone off the beach right now.
...evacuate.
We need everyone inside.
Guys, check this out.
I broke down the drone pilot's call with a wave modulator and I unscrambled his voice.
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
Our mystery voice belongs to a Jonathan Redmond, an ex-VenPax employee.
He was fired three years ago for stealing company hardware.
VenPax had his voice print on file after Redmond made numerous harassing phone calls.
All right, did VenPax ever press charges?
No, they were worried that the company secrets would get out during a trial.
Yeah, well, no wonder they didn't mention Redmond to us.
A cancer like that could kill a billion-dollar contract.
But, lucky for us, Redmond continued his thieving ways and was arrested by HPD two years ago for several burglaries.
He served 18 months, then was paroled a few weeks ago.
All right, where do we find this punk?
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
Maybe he's operating it from a remote location.
Danny, call Chin;
have him run background on Redmond's family, friends, anybody who might know where he is.
Kono.
Hey.
You find Redmond?
No, he's keeping a low profile.
Okay.
Well, I ran his financials.
I found four wire transfers, totaling $500,000, deposited to an offshore account.
Who sent the money?
I traced it back to a textile company here in town.
The CIA thinks it's a front for the SRS.
SRS is an international terrorist group made of the best former Soviet Union intelligence agents.
Redmond told us he's on a rampage for revenge and ideological reasons, but this half-a-million bucks makes me think that's just to throw us off.
Maybe this is really about money.
All right, so if these SRS guys are paying Redmond to terrorize the island, the question is: why?
I mean, it makes no sense, right?
I mean, if they wanted to hit us bad, they'd have far more impact on the mainland.
Guys, I don't think we're looking at the whole picture.
I think it's about something bigger.
I dug a little deeper, and I found more wire transfers to a systems analyst named Lawrence Turner.
Up until a month ago,
Turner was working for a local military contractor.
The CIA discovered he'd been using his security clearance to download thousands of classified documents.
And he started selling them, piece by piece.
Let me guess-- they were bought, paid for by the same textile company that slid Redmond the 500 racks.
Exactly.
Where's Turner now?
Well, that's what the CIA wants to know.
When they went to arrest him last month, he disappeared.
CIA thinks that Turner's still on the island.
They have their eyes on the ports and the airstrips.
And they've been monitoring the chatter ever since he fell off the radar.
They think he's never left.
Whoa, Sarah Connor, I come in peace.
Jerry, what the hell is that?
It's how we're gonna stop our shooter.
Oh!
Easy, boy.
Check it out-- this thing creates an electromagnetic field which will disrupt our pilot's signal.
All you got to do is get me close enough to the drone, and this puppy will do the rest.
Oh, that's all.
Okay.
Well, how we gonna do that?
We give our shooter a little bait.
Bait?
Like, uh...
Oh, we're the, uh... the bait?
Where are you guys?
Kalakaua and Saratoga.
All right, just keep circling the block.
If our guy bites, we're two minutes away.
So stupid.
This is so stupid.
Okay?
It's stupid.
What?
What, what?
I'm chum, okay?
My life has been reduced to a piece of chum.
Thank you.
It's a solid plan.
It's a solid plan?
Now it's...
It's a solid plan hatched by a guy who believes that aliens are living amongst us.
You got a better plan?
I'd like to hear it.
What, like, right this second?
No, next week.
After we've enjoyed the traffic-free roads and the no wait for a table at BLT next week.
Hey, hey!
I don't need the sarcasm, okay?
I'm already risking my life.
I don't need the added sarcasm.
Okay, you don't like it, you can get out and walk.
How about that?
What is this, high school?
No, look.
Sir.
Sir.
Wake up.
Get up.
Wake up.
We got to get you inside, okay?
You got to get indoors, all right?
Go.
Steve!
Get down!
Get down!
Hey, hey!
We're taking fire on Koa and Ocean!
Hang on.
Steve, you all right?
Take cover.
Go.
Take cover.
Come on, get up, come on.
That thing's coming back.
We got to get out of here.
Come on.
I can't drive, Danny.
Oh, really?
There's a silver lining in the face of death.
Fantastic.
My leg will heal.
Don't get used to it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Faster, Danny.
Come on.
It's going fa...
This is as fast as it goes.
You know this.
You're not even redlining, okay?
Look, shut up, okay?
I don't know what's worse, your driving or your backseat driving.
Zip it.
Kono, go ahead.
We're a little busy.
Guys, air traffic control is reporting a small aircraft on approach.
No, no, no, no, no.
I thought we shut down the airport.
We did.
But this thing isn't landing at the airport.
It's headed for town.
Wait a minute.
We got this all wrong.
This is a...
this is an aircraft extraction.
The drone attack was just a diversion.
Right, they paid Redmond to clear the streets so they can land a plane and pick up Lawrence Turner.
If he gets on that plane, he'll compromise national security.
Steve.
I see it.
Lou, where are you?
Right behind you!
All right, come on, Jerry.
It's your turn.
This thing is gonna work, isn't it?
Theoretically.
No, no.
Wrong answer, Jerry.
Wrong answer.
Okay, okay.
It's gonna work.
I think.
I got a lock on its signal!
She's mine.
You got it.
All right!
One nasty killing machine down for the count!
Nice one.
Go, go!
Stop that plane.
I got this.
Jerry, check the transmission log.
It'll tell us where the pilot's operating from.
Copy, copy.
One will suffice.
Copy.
Okay, got it.
The operator's GPS coordinates are North two-one, dot, 288824, West 157 dot 852056...
Steve, the plane's starting to move.
It's taking off!
No way we're gonna stop that now.
Relax, partners.
I got this.
Jerry, what are you doing?
Feeling the Force.
Just like Skywalker on the trench run.
Hang on.
Yeah!
Son of a bitch.
He did it.
He really did it.
We got movement!
I got Turner!
On your knees!
Get your hands on your head!
Seven people are dead, even more injured.
For what?
A payday?
Isn't that why we get up in the morning?
That's what I get up for.
And this.
Turner!
It's over.
Lawrence Turner you're under arrest for espionage.
You know, you ought to look into whether they got some kind of a loyalty program.
Like, they'll give you a card, and every fifth bullet extraction is free.
Well, I'm certain such a program doesn't exist, Captain.
I believe he was joking, Max.
Ah.
I can see how that was an attempt at humor.
Oh, keep it up, wise guy.
You might see an attempt at murder.
Lou, he wasn't being rude.
He's-he's just Max, and you'll learn that.
You know, that reminds me, Max.
It's been killing me all day.
What did you tell your new protégé about me?
I beg your pardon?
Well, you said you gave her a heads up.
Heads up about what?
What did you say?
Oh, yes.
I just explained to Dr. Shaw that Commander McGarrett is the leader of Five-O, and that you're his deeply cynical, misanthropic, short-tempered partner.
What?
You know, I think I see what you mean about him.
Now, Dr. Shaw agreed with my assessment.
However, she did think you were cute.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Well, she got a point, right?
I can live with that.
What?
Brother, I thought you were shot.
I was.
In my thigh.
Thigh?
That don't count.
For you?
No, for you, it would not.
Thought you was down for the count.
I brought you some garlic shrimp and some balloons.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Maybe next time, they can hit a vital organ.
We be back.
Your chariot awaits, brave warrior.
All right.
Thanks, Jerry.
All right.
I'll see youse.
Hey, thanks.
Yup.
You're not coming?
No, no, no, I'm gonna take, uh, this opportunity to... have a nice drive in my car in private.
I thought your car was shot up.
Yeah, I'm gonna take the long way to the body shop.
See you guys.
Hey, Commander, you want to make a stop?
You can help me out with my surveillance.
Wow.
That's, uh...
that's tempting, Jerry.
But you know what?
I think I'd like to go home.
I've had enough excitement for one day.
Okay?
No, I got it.
Hi.
Hi.
Now... where were we?
Adam, there is nothing I'd like more than to be your wife.
So what's stopping you?
It's just everything that we've been through.
I just want to know that we're gonna be safe.
I can't go through that again.
Thinking I'm gonna lose you.
Hey.
Hey, you're not gonna lose me.
I promise.
You promise?
I promise.
When I heard you were coming to see me, I asked myself why.
And then I realized, it's the two-year anniversary of my sister's murder, which means you must be here to apologize for letting it happen.
You remember the $25 million in an offshore account you tried to bribe me with?
Internal Affairs has been watching me ever since you were arrested.
They think I have that money.
It's not my problem.
I want you to sign an affidavit saying that the money never changed hands.
Why would I do that?
Because maybe for once in your miserable life, you'll want to do something decent.
Let me think about it.
I'll get back to you.
Thank you, sir.
Who is he?
That's what we have to find out.
Because if he knows, we're gonna have to deal with that.
Grace?
Grace?
I believe Grace isn't due back from school for another half hour.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop.
What are you doing in my house?
Who are you?
I'm Marco Reyes.
Oh.
That supposed to mean something to me?
Your brother never mentioned me to you?
My brother...
No.
No, he didn't.
Well, I'm hurt.
Matt and I were so close.
What is it that I can do for you?
Your brother took something from me, and you're gonna help me get it back.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
So, uh, we have, uh, been together for three years.
Four.
See, this is, uh, specifically what I am talking about.
I'm just correcting you.
Okay.
Uh, four years.
It was three years, eleven months, two days, exactly.
You done?
Detective Williams asked you a question.
When?
He asked if you were going to allow him to finish his thought.
I'm-
- I'm sorry, whose side are you on?
I don't take sides, commander.
I'm an objective observer.
As you know, the governor asked me to oversee the annual psychological audit of personnel, and I was concerned by what Detective Williams had to say.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Yeah, fine.
So we, uh, don't-- We don't agree on a few things.
But I don't see why that's such a big deal.
I'm gonna go ahead and stop you.
A few things?
We don't agree on anything.
Okay, name one.
Okay.
Um, I never get to drive my own automobile.
And I don't understand why you're angry about that.
I mean, I'd think you'd be grateful for being driven around.
Who am I?
Ms. Daisy?
- Sometimes I like to drive my own car.
- Sometimes you do drive.
Sometimes?
Are you saying that with a straight face in front of this woman?
Do you never drive your car?
I don't always drive your car.
I get to drive my car when you're not in it.
When I'm alone, I get to drive my own car.
Yeah.
That's sometimes.
Okay, you know what?
Fine.
You wanna know why you spend so much time in the passenger seat?
- Wanna know?
- This should be fanta-
- Yes.
- I get carsick if I don't drive.
- Ha, ha.
And he laughs.
And he laughs.
First time I've told him that.
Because it's ridiculous, okay?
He's a control freak.
He's a gigantic control freak.
It has nothing to do with motion, trust me, please.
- Detective Williams.
- Yeah?
Commander McGarrett is sharing something very personal with you.
Perhaps you could show him a little respect.
- But he's lying.
- I'm not lying.
He's a Navy SEAL.
- What has that got to do with it?
- Okay, okay.
- What has it got to do with it?
- Please stop.
I don't really wanna be here, respectfully.
I'm sure he doesn't either.
If you're not gonna be honest,
- I'm gonna leave.
- I'm being honest.
- Gentlemen.
- Yes?
This is a mandated review.
So let's continue, shall we?
- Fine with me.
- Yeah.
It's good.
- Why don't we shift gears a bit?
- All right.
Describe how you two first met.
- Hands up!
- Who are you?
Who are you?
I am Detective Danny Williams.
Lieutenant Commander McGarrett.
- This is my father's house.
- Put your weapon down.
You put your weapon down and show me your ID.
- You show me your ID.
- I'm not putting my gun down.
Neither am I.
Four years ago,
Governor Jameson asked me to start a, uh, major-crimes task force.
And Danno--
I'm gonna stop-- See, he knows that I don't like that.
You're right.
Excuse me.
Sir Daniel.
This... is going right off the rails.
This right here--
Come on.
I'm teasing, all right?
Right after I started the task force, Detective Williams was my first hire.
You got no choice, detective.
Governor gave me jurisdiction on making you my partner.
We're gonna get along great.
Right.
I personally wouldn't call it, um, a hire.
It was more like a kidnapping.
A ransom.
It was the kind of thing-- I didn't have a choice.
I liked his sense of humor, you know, his personality.
You're right.
I don't like you.
When you're getting shot at, it is nice to reflect on what a nutjob this guy is.
Tell me about the others.
Well, after Danny signed on,
- we recruited Chin Ho Kelly.
- I can't be a cop anymore.
I'm the last person the department wants to see wearing a badge.
He was fired from the H.P.D. at the time.
That's right.
But we straightened that out.
Yeah, and then, uh, Kono Kalakaua-- That's Chin's cousin. --she was next.
I'm told she wasn't even a police officer at the time.
Your cousin tells us you're graduating from the police academy next week.
How'd you like to earn extra credit?
Yeah, she was a few weeks away from graduating from the academy.
But, uh, we needed a female, you see, and she fit the bill.
And just recently, we recruited a former H.P.D. SWAT commander named Lou Grover from Chicago.
We want you to join Five-0.
So five people make up the Five-0 task force?
Yeah, but we're, uh, more than a task force, you see.
We're 'ohana.
Why the look, Detective Williams?
Oh, no look.
Um...
I guess I was just, uh, agreeing with him for the first time.
I think we're good.
You're doing great, honey.
Keep going.
- Keep going.
- I can't.
Come on, just a few more steps.
The view, it's fantastic.
Hey, now.
You haven't turned around once.
What can I say?
I've got the best scenery right here.
Well, this scenery is gonna need an afternoon at the spa after this.
Deal.
Now hustle.
We're almost there.
You're gonna love what you see.
- Race you?
- You're on.
What is that?
Think you're gonna get a few of those waves next time?
- Aren't you gonna rinse off?
- I'd rather watch you.
Get over here.
You take such good care of me.
Have you thought any more about what we talked about?
Ah.
- Sorry.
- Hey, it's okay.
- You gotta take it, right?
- Yeah.
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm on my way.
- Adam...
- Hey.
Don't ever apologize for doing your job, okay?
Go.
I'll take the boards home, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
I'll see you later.
I'm heading to a crime scene.
Diamond Head Trail.
In case you lose me.
Here you go.
What do we got, Lou?
Two dead, name of Todd Sands and Tracy Powell.
Both schoolteachers on the mainland.
I found this on the male vic.
Apparently, he was looking for a romantic spot to pop the question.
- Any witnesses?
- Just the birds.
These are 7.62 rounds.
This is military-issue.
Mahalo, Commander McGarrett.
You saved me a trip to Ballistics.
You're welcome, Max.
What do we got on the victims?
They appear to have been shot in close proximity.
- How close?
- Dr. Shaw, care to opine?
Well, based on several identifiers, including multiple through-and-throughs,
I'd estimate ten to 15 feet, with a trajectory of approximately 45 degrees.
- All right, who's your friend, Max?
- This is Dr. Shaw.
She's a recent graduate of Johns Hopkins University.
I will be mentoring her in the medical arts.
Oh.
Well, lucky you.
- You must be Detective Williams.
- Yeah.
I have given her the full heads-up.
- You gave her the heads-up on what?
- It's all true.
- Heh.
- I'm Steve McGarrett.
- Welcome aboard, Dr. Shaw.
- Nice to be aboard.
Okay, I don't get it.
So if they were attacked at close range, what are we looking at here?
Very fit mugger with a serious automatic weapon?
That'd be a sound theory except for I found both wallets, rental-car keys and jewelry in their backpacks.
Maybe it was personal.
Perp knew they were climbing, was waiting for them at the top.
What do you got there, Danny?
Think we found our shooter.
You ever see anything like that before?
It's a UCAV.
A combat drone.
So, what are you saying?
A machine did this?
Not on its own.
Someone somewhere pulled the trigger.
- What are you guys doing here?
- You first.
I'm on surveillance.
How'd you find me?
Your mother's car has an antitheft device.
Technology's not my friend.
Well, get in before you blow my cover.
No, no.
Wait.
I got it.
That's very 1988.
Okay, Jerry, I know I'm gonna regret asking this, but what is it that you are surveilling?
What you two should be keeping an eye on.
Ah.
Good point.
Girls in spandex.
Next door over.
Vintage books.
What about it?
Two weeks ago, the owner came back from a trip to Düsseldorf, where he purchased the entire inventory of a library that was closing down.
Get out of here.
Well, let's go arrest this guy.
- What are we doing?
- Not so fast, McGruff.
He hasn't committed a crime yet, but he's gonna, trust me.
Okay, how do you know that?
That library in Düsseldorf was ancient.
And the books inside it were period.
The paper in those books, 75 percent cotton, 25 percent ultrafine linen.
You know what that means?
I do.
It makes for good counterfeiting stock.
You are going to the head of the class.
Just because he bought the books, doesn't mean he's gonna recycle the paper and start printing bills.
- What else is he gonna do with them?
- I don't know.
Maybe the vintage bookshop owner is gonna sell them.
No one reads hard-copy books anymore.
Even I know that.
You might be onto something here, okay, but you can't be doing this.
- You're a civilian.
- I'm a seeker of truth.
You are also a conspiracy theorist who still lives with his mother and has yet to file a tax return.
Listen to me.
Call the H.P.D. They can handle this.
I did call the H.P.D.
They treated me like I was some sort of nutjob.
That's, heh, shocking.
Jerry, I'll help you dig into this, I promise, all right?
But we need your help.
Take a look at this.
Ooh.
Not here.
We're too exposed.
What is that?
- Where was this taken?
- Here on Oahu.
This thing was used in an attack this morning that left two people dead.
I've seen drones before, but I've never seen anything like that.
I reached out to my military contacts, but they wouldn't disclose much, due to operational security.
So I figured maybe you could help.
Okay, I'm pretty sure what we're looking at is a prototype domestic surveillance drone.
Minus the evil aftermarket weaponized payload, of course.
The government has been denying use of domestic drones for a very long time.
That's why you hit a brick wall with the military.
Think they're gonna admit to violating your right to privacy?
Better chance of getting a backstage pass at Area 51.
Okay, what about a manufacturer?
Any ideas?
I seem to recall some chatter about a drone coming out of a super-secret advanced development program, a branch of a local military contractor named VenPax Systems.
It could be your manufacturer.
Obviously, you didn't get that from me.
Obviously.
I'd like to help you out, but I can neither confirm nor deny that this particular UAV belongs to us.
- You can't?
- No.
Okay, well, maybe you can, uh, confirm or deny that these people are dead.
- Did you know them?
- No.
Todd Sands and Tracy Powell.
They were here on vacation.
They got here on Monday.
They went to a luau, and they did a tour of Waimea Falls Park.
And now they're dead, and I wanna know why.
Look, you have to understand that this project is a matter of national security, so I can't just answer your questions without compromising what we're doing.
You have to understand if you don't answer our questions, the only thing you're gonna be compromising is your freedom.
Commander, we're under contract by the military.
That means that we operate under their level of security.
So threatening me isn't gonna work.
Book him, Danno.
- Whoa.
Did you hear what I just said?
- Yeah, loud and clear.
Put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest for obstruction, withholding information and impeding a murder investigation.
None of that's gonna stick, and you know it.
True.
But how many more government contracts do you think you're gonna get after a background check shows an arrest on your record?
- Let's go.
- Okay.
Okay.
All right, this is QV-901.
It's a surveillance drone with no other payload, which means it flies unarmed.
Three weeks ago, while it was on a routine test flight, it was hijacked, never recovered.
- How do you hijack a drone?
- GPS spoofing.
Somebody jammed VenPax's control signal to the UAV, fed it false GPS data and made it land wherever the hijacker wanted it.
Okay, so, what are we looking at here?
Inside job?
Security breach?
We don't know yet.
Uh, VenPax gave us a list of their current and ex-employees that had clearance on the project.
We should run their names against the victims', see if we come up with a connection.
Right, and if we find one, that might explain motive.
I'll tell you something.
Takes a special kind of brilliance to hijack a drone, arm it and reprogram it.
We are dealing with one very smart, very sick son of a bitch.
Same drone that attacked our hikers this morning.
Witnesses say that it flew in, hovered, gathering a crowd, and then, bang, opened fire.
Ten seconds later, we got five dead, 19 wounded.
Chin Ho and Kono are running IDs right now to see if they can make any connection between the victims of both attacks.
One of my guys got a few shots at the drone, trying to bring it down.
Bystander caught it on video.
That's good shooting.
If he had missed, more people would've been dead.
We can't find any correlation between the Kuhio Beach and the Diamond Head victims.
Which means the targets could be random.
All right, we need to start looking at this as an act of terrorism.
Except for the fact that no group or individual has claimed responsibility.
- Maybe they're not done yet.
- Good.
I'm glad you're all here.
I got some more intel on that drone you're looking for.
But first a disclaimer.
Whatever I share with you today is in no way connected to me, my family or anyone I know.
I'm strictly here on a tour of the palace, nothing more.
Any attempt to associate me with the information I'm about to share will be vehemently denied by myself and the attorney I will retain.
Are we understood?
Do we--?
Should we sign something, everybody?
Or is "Get on with it--?" Will that suffice, Jerry?
You're so naive about how this world really works.
We get it.
Get on with it.
What do you got?
As far as drones go, they may be state-of-the-art, but the technology is still incredibly immature.
They are severely limited by a whole heap of engineering issues, such as an unprotected frequency band.
There's just not enough spectrum to go around.
Okay.
What does that mean in the language the rest of us speak?
It means that you can buy all the equipment you need to hijack a drone at your local hardware store.
You can?
Oh, good.
Well, then, um, go ahead.
That should cover it.
Go ahead.
Okay, not so fast, Donald Trump.
I can jack this thing from your shooter.
The problem is, you gotta be within 200 yards from the drone to tap into the frequency.
Okay, so, what you're saying is there's nothing we can do until it attacks again.
We have to be there when it attacks again.
Sarge, some guy just called claiming he's responsible for the drone attacks.
How do we know it's real?
He knew details we haven't released to the public.
Said he's gonna call back in ten minutes and wants to speak to someone in charge.
Patch him through to McGarrett.
- Chin, run a trace.
- We're on it.
- Almost there.
- Come on, Chin.
- Come on.
Come on, Chin.
Come on.
- Almost there, almost there.
All right, go.
This is Steve McGarrett.
Who am I talking to?
You're going to have to do much better than that, Steve.
Oh, you think this is funny?
Seven people are dead, and there's a lot more in the hospital.
On the contrary, I think it's a tragedy.
But it's nothing compared to the hundreds killed by your drone attacks in the Middle East.
You're comparing sworn enemies of the United States to innocent civilians.
There were plenty of innocents killed in those attacks too, McGarrett.
You of all people should know that.
So that's what this is about for you?
Revenge?
ls that right?
- Justice.
- Justice?
You want our government to apologize for keeping us safe?
No.
We are way past apologies.
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
So you're saying this isn't over?
- Not by a long shot.
- Okay, hold on.
- Just hold on a second.
Wait.
- Expect more blood in two hours.
- Tell me you got that.
- No.
He must have bounced that call off a dozen different relay stations and satellites.
Lou, call the H.P.D. Tell them the island is under siege.
We need to get everybody off the streets right now.
The governor is asking everyone to remain indoors away from windows, and do not venture outside until further notice.
Let's go through what we know right now.
A weaponized drone opened attack in Waikiki...
Let's go, let's go, everyone.
Let's go.
We gotta get indoors.
Keep your keikis close.
Everyone get indoors.
Let's go, let's go, everyone.
Keep your keikis close.
Danno, what's going on?
Doesn't matter what's going on, all right?
Go inside, listen to your coaches, do as they say, and I will call you as soon as I can, all right?
- All right.
I love you.
- Love you too.
Off the beach.
We need everyone off the beach right now.
Governor has declared an evacuation.
We need everyone inside.
Guys, check this out.
I broke down the drone pilot's call with a wave modulator, and I unscrambled his voice.
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
Our mystery voice belongs to a Jonathan Redmond, an ex-VenPax employee.
He was fired three years ago for stealing company hardware.
VenPax had his voice print on file after Redmond made numerous harassing phone calls.
All right, did VenPax ever press charges?
They were worried that the company secrets would get out during a trial.
No wonder they didn't mention Redmond to us.
A cancer like that could kill a billion-dollar contract.
But lucky for us, Redmond continued his thieving ways and was arrested by H.P.D. two years ago for several burglaries.
He served 18 months, then was paroled a few weeks ago.
All right, where do we find this punk?
Clear.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Maybe he's operating it from a remote location.
Call Chin, have him run background on Redmond's family, friends, anybody who might know where he is.
- Kono.
- Hey.
You find Redmond?
No, he's keeping a low profile.
Okay.
Well, I ran his financials.
I found four wire transfers totaling $500,000 deposited to an offshore account.
Who sent the money?
I traced it back to a textile company here in town.
The CIA thinks it's a front for the SRS.
SRS is an international terrorist group made of the best former Soviet Union intelligence agents.
Redmond told us he's on a rampage for revenge and ideological reasons, but this half a million bucks makes me think that's just to throw us off.
Maybe this is really about money.
All right, so if these SRS guys are paying Redmond to terrorize the island, the question is, why?
I mean, it makes no sense, right?
I mean, if they wanted to hit us bad, they'd have far more impact on the mainland.
I don't think we're looking at the whole picture.
It's about something bigger.
I dug a little deeper, and I found more wire transfers to a systems analyst named Lawrence Turner.
Up until a month ago,
Turner was working for a local military contractor.
The CIA discovered he'd been using his security clearance to download thousands of classified documents.
He started selling them, piece by piece.
Let me guess.
They were bought and paid for by the same textile company that slid Redmond the 500 racks.
- Exactly.
- Where's Turner now?
That's what the CIA wants to know.
When they went to arrest him last month, he disappeared.
CIA thinks that Turner's still on the island.
They have their eyes on ports and airstrips.
They've been monitoring the chatter since he fell off the radar.
They think he's never left.
Whoa, Sarah Connor, I come in peace.
Jerry, what the hell is that?
It's how we're gonna stop our shooter.
Oh, easy, boy.
Check it out.
This thing creates an electromagnetic field, which will disrupt our pilot's signal.
All you gotta do is get me close to the drone.
- This puppy will do the rest.
- That's all.
Okay.
How we gonna do that?
- We give our shooter a little bait.
- Bait?
Like, uh...?
Oh, we're the, uh-
- The bait?
- Where are you guys?
- Kalakaua and Saratoga.
Just keep circling the block.
If our guy bites, we're two minutes away.
So stupid.
This is so stupid.
- Okay?
It's stupid.
- What?
What, what?
I'm chum, okay?
My life has been reduced to a piece of chum.
- Thank you.
- It's a solid plan.
It's a solid plan?
Now it's--?
It's a solid plan hatched by a guy who believes that aliens are living amongst us.
You got a better plan?
I'd like to hear it.
- What, right this second?
- No, next week.
After we've enjoyed the traffic-free roads and the no wait for a table at BLT next week.
Hey, I don't need the sarcasm, okay?
I'm already risking my life.
I don't need the added sarcasm.
Okay, you don't like it, you can get out and walk.
- What is this, high school?
- No, look.
Sir.
Sir.
Wake up.
Get up.
Wake up.
We gotta get you inside, okay?
- You gotta get indoors, all right?
Go.
- Steve!
Get down!
Hey, hey.
We're taking fire on Koa and Ocean.
Hang on.
- Steve, you all right?
- Take cover.
Go.
Take cover.
Get up, come on.
That thing's coming back.
We gotta get out of here.
Come on.
- I can't drive, Danny.
- Oh, really?
There's a silver lining in the face of death.
Fantastic.
- My leg will heal.
Don't get used to it.
- Come on.
Let's go.
Come on.
Faster, Danny.
Come on.
- It's going-
- This is as fast as it goes.
- You're not even redlining, okay?
Shut up, okay?
I don't know what's worse, your driving or your backseat driving.
Zip it.
Kono, go ahead.
We're a little busy.
Guys, air traffic control is reporting a small aircraft on approach.
No, no, no.
I thought we shut down the airport.
We did.
But this thing isn't landing at the airport.
It's headed for town.
Wait, we got this all wrong.
This is an aircraft extraction.
The drone attack was just a diversion.
Right, they paid Redmond to clear the streets so they could land a plane and pick up Lawrence Turner.
If he gets on that plane, he'll compromise national security.
- Steve.
- I see it.
Lou, where are you?
Right behind you.
All right, come on, Jerry.
It's your turn.
- This thing is gonna work, isn't it?
- Theoretically.
No, no, no.
Wrong answer, Jerry.
Wrong answer.
Okay, okay.
It's gonna work.
I think.
I got a lock on its signal.
- She's mine.
- You got it.
All right!
One nasty killing machine down for the count.
Nice one.
Go, go.
Stop that plane.
I got this.
Check the transmission log.
It'll tell us where the pilot's operating from.
- Copy, copy.
- One will suffice.
Copy.
Okay, got it.
The operator's GPS coordinates are north 21.288824, west 157.852.
Steve, the plane's starting to move.
It's taking off.
No way we're gonna stop that now.
Relax, partners.
I got this.
- Jerry, what are you doing?
- Feeling the force.
Just like Skywalker on the trench run.
Hang on.
Yeah!
Son of a bitch.
He really did it.
We got movement.
I got Turner.
On your knees!
Get your hands on your head!
Seven people are dead, even more injured.
For what?
A payday?
Isn't that why we get up in the morning?
That's what I get up for.
And this.
Turner!
It's over.
Lawrence Turner, you're under arrest for espionage.
You ought to look into whether they got some kind of a loyalty program.
Like they'll give you a card, and every fifth bullet extraction is free.
Well, I'm certain such a program doesn't exist, captain.
I believe he was joking, Max.
Ah.
I can see how that was an attempt at humor.
Oh, keep it up, wise guy.
You might see an attempted murder.
Lou, he wasn't being rude.
He's just Max.
And you'll learn that.
That reminds me, Max.
It's been killing me all day.
What did you tell your new protégé about me?
- I beg your pardon?
- You said you gave her a heads-up.
Heads-up about what?
What did you say?
Oh, yes.
I just explained to Dr. Shaw that Commander McGarrett is the leader of Five-0 and that you're his deeply cynical, misanthropic, short-tempered partner.
What?
I think I see what you mean about him.
Now, Dr. Shaw agreed with my assessment.
However, she did think you were cute.
- Hey.
- Aha.
Well, she's got a point, right?
I can live with that.
What?
Brother, I thought you were shot.
- I was.
In my thigh.
- Thigh?
That don't count.
- For you?
No, for you, it would not.
- Thought you was down for the count.
I brought you some garlic shrimp and some balloons.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Maybe next time, they can hit a vital organ.
We be back.
Your chariot awaits, brave warrior.
- All right.
- Thanks, Jerry.
- All right.
I'll see youse.
- Hey, thanks.
- Yup.
- You're not coming?
No, no, no, I'm gonna take, uh, this opportunity to have a nice drive in my car in private.
I thought your car was shot up.
Yeah, I'm gonna take the long way to the body shop.
See you guys.
Hey, commander, you wanna make a stop?
You can help me out with my surveillance.
Wow, that's, uh...
That's tempting, Jerry, but you know what?
I think I'd like to go home.
I've had enough excitement for one day.
Okay?
No, I got it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Now, where were we?
Adam, there is nothing I'd like more than to be your wife.
So, what's stopping you?
It's just everything that we've been through.
I just wanna know that we're gonna be safe.
I can't go through that again.
Thinking I'm gonna lose you.
Hey.
Hey.
You're not gonna lose me.
I promise.
You promise?
I promise.
When I heard you were coming to see me, I asked myself why.
And then I realized it's the two-year anniversary of my sister's murder, which means you must be here to apologize for letting it happen.
You remember the 25 million in an offshore account you tried to bribe me with?
Internal Affairs has been watching me ever since you were arrested.
They think I have that money.
It's not my problem.
I want you to sign an affidavit saying that the money never changed hands.
Why would I do that?
Because maybe for once in your miserable life, you wanna do something decent.
Let me think about it.
I'll get back to you.
Thank you, sir.
Who is he?
That's what we have to find out.
Because if he knows, we're gonna have to deal with that.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Well, after Danny signed on, we recruited Chin Ho Kelly.
I can't be a cop anymore.
I'm the last person the department wants to see wearing a badge.
CARLIN:
He was fired from the HPD at the time.
That's right, but we straightened that out.
Yeah, and then, uh, Kono Kalakaua-- that's Chin's cousin-- she was next.
CARLIN:
I'm told she wasn't even a police officer at the time.
STEVE:
So your cousin tells us you're graduating from the police academy next week.
How'd you like to earn a little extra credit before you do?
Yeah, she was a few weeks away from graduating from the academy.
But, uh, we needed a female, you see?
And she fit the bill.
And just recently, we recruited a former HPD SWAT commander named Lou Grover, from Chicago.
We want you to join Five-O.

How close?

Well, based on several identifiers, including multiple through-and-throughs,
I'd estimate ten to 15 feet, with a trajectory of approximately 45 degrees.

Not so fast, McGruff.
He hasn't committed a crime yet, but he's gonna-- trust me.

That library in Dusseldorf was ancient.
And the books inside it were period.

I do.
It makes for good counterfeiting stock.
You, sir, are going to the head of the class.

I've seen drones before, but I've never seen anything like that.
I reached out to my military contacts, but they wouldn't disclose much information due to operational security.
So I figured maybe you could help.
JERRY:
Okay, I'm pretty sure what we're looking at is a prototype domestic surveillance drone.
Minus the evil aftermarket weaponized payload, of course.
The government has been denying use of domestic drones for a very long time, all right?
That's why you hit a brick wall with the military.
(laughs)
Think they're gonna admit to violating your right to privacy?
Better chance of getting a backstage pass at Area 51.
Okay, what about a manufacturer?
Any ideas?
I seem to recall some chatter about a drone coming out of a super-secret advanced development program-- a branch of a local military contractor named VenPax Systems.
It could be your manufacturer.
Obviously, you didn't get that from me.
Obviously.
VENIT:
I'd like to help you guys out, but the truth is I can neither confirm nor deny that this particular UAV belongs to us.
You can't?
No.
Okay, well, maybe you can, uh, "confirm or deny"
that these people are dead.
STEVE:
Did you know them?
No.
Todd Sands and Tracy Powell-- they were here on vacation.
They got here on Monday, they went to a luau, and they did a tour of Waimea Falls Park.
And now they're dead, and I want to know why.
Look, you have to understand that this project is a matter of national security, so I can't just answer your questions without compromising what we're doing here.
And you have to understand, if you don't answer our questions, the only thing you're gonna be compromising is your freedom.
Commander, we're under contract by the military.
That means that we operate under their level of security.
So threatening me isn't gonna work.
Book him, Danno.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you hear what I just said?
Yeah, loud and clear.
Put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest for obstruction, withholding information, and impeding a murder investigation.
None of that's gonna stick, and you know it.
STEVE:
True.
But how many more government contracts do you think you're gonna get after a background check shows an arrest on your record?
Let's go.
Okay.
Okay.
All right, this is QV-901.
It's a surveillance drone with no other payload, which means it flies unarmed.
Three weeks ago, while it was on a routine test flight, it was hijacked, never recovered.
How do you hijack a drone?
GPS spoofing.
Somebody jammed VenPax's control signal to the UAV, fed it false GPS data, and made it land wherever the hijacker wanted it.
KONO:
Okay, so what are we looking at here?
Inside job?
Security breach?
We don't know yet.
Uh, VenPax gave us a list of all their current and ex-employees that had clearance on the project, so we should run their names against the victims, see if we come up with a connection.
Right, and if we find one, that might explain motive.
I'll tell you something, takes a special kind of brilliance to hijack a drone, arm it and reprogram it.
We are dealing with one very smart, very sick son of a bitch.

Any attempt to associate me with the information I'm about to share will be vehemently denied by myself and the attorney I will retain.
Are we understood?
D-Do we...
Should we sign something, everybody?
Or just, "Get on with it,"
will that suffice, Jerry?
You're so naive about how this world really works.
Jerry, we get it.
Get on with it.
What do you got?
As far as drones go, they may be state-of-the-art, but the technology is still incredibly immature.
They are severely limited by a whole heap of engineering issues, such as an unprotected frequency band.
There's just not enough spectrum to go around.
Okay.
What does that mean in the language the rest of us speak?
It means that you can buy all the equipment you need to hijack a drone at your local hardware store.
DANNY:
You can?
Oh, good.
Well, then, um...
Go ahead.
That should cover it.
Go ahead.
Okay, not so fast, Donald Trump.
I can jack this thing from your shooter.
Only problem is, got to be within 200 yards from the drone to tap into the frequency.
KONO:
Okay, so what you're saying is there's nothing we can do until it attacks again.
Correction: we have to be there when it attacks again.
Sarge, some guy just called claiming he's responsible for the drone attacks.
How do we know it's real?
He knew details we haven't released to the public.
Said he's gonna call back in ten minutes and wants to speak to someone in charge.
Patch him through to McGarrett.
Chin, run a trace.
We're on it.
Almost there.
Come on, Chin.
Come on, come on, Chin.
Come on, come on.
Almost there, almost there.
Almost there, almost there.
All right, go.
This is Steve McGarrett.
Who am I talking to?
(laughing)
(voice scrambled):
You're going to have to do much better than that, Steve.
Oh, you think this is funny?
Seven people are dead, and there's a lot more in the hospital.
On the contrary, I think it's a tragedy.
But it's nothing compared to the hundreds killed by your drone attacks in the Middle East.
You're comparing sworn enemies of the United States to innocent civilians.
There were plenty of innocents killed in those attacks, too,
Commander McGarrett.
You of all people should know that.
So that's what this is about for you?
Revenge?
Is that right?
Justice.
Justice?
You want our government to apologize for keeping us safe?
No.
We are way past apologies.
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
So you're saying this isn't over?
Not by a long shot.
Okay, hold on.
Just hold on a second.
Wait.
Expect more blood in two hours.
(line clicks)
Tell me you got that.
No.
He must have bounced that call off a dozen different relay stations and satellites.
Lou, call the HPD.
Tell them the island is under siege.
We need to get everybody off the streets right now.
(sirens blaring)
(sirens continue blaring)
WOMAN (over TV):
The governor is asking everyone to remain indoors, away from windows and do not venture outside until further notice.
Now let's go through what we know right now.
A weaponized drone opened attack in Waikiki...
Let's go, let's go, everyone!
Let's go!
We got to get indoors!
Keep your keikis close!
Everyone get indoors!
Let's go, let's go, everyone!
Keep your keikis close!
Danno, what's going on?
DANNY:
Doesn't matter what's going on, all right?
Go inside, listen to your coaches, do as they say, and I will call you as soon as I can, all right?
All right, I love you.
Love you, too.
MAN (over P.A.):
We need everyone off the beach right now.
(sirens whooping) ...evacuate.
We need everyone inside.
(phone ringing)
KONO:
Guys, check this out.
I broke down the drone pilot's call with a wave modulator and I unscrambled his voice.
MAN:
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
Our mystery voice belongs to a Jonathan Redmond, an ex-VenPax employee.
He was fired three years ago for stealing company hardware.
VenPax had his voice print on file after Redmond made numerous harassing phone calls.
All right, did VenPax ever press charges?
No, they were worried that the company secrets would get out during a trial.
Yeah, well, no wonder they didn't mention Redmond to us.
A cancer like that could kill a billion-dollar contract.
But, lucky for us, Redmond continued his thieving ways and was arrested by HPD two years ago for several burglaries.
He served 18 months, then was paroled a few weeks ago.
All right, where do we find this punk?
DANNY:
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
Maybe he's operating it from a remote location.
Danny, call Chin;
have him run background on Redmond's family, friends, anybody who might know where he is.
(cell phone ringing)
Kono.
Hey.
You find Redmond?
No, he's keeping a low profile.
Okay.
Well, I ran his financials.
I found four wire transfers, totaling $500,000, deposited to an offshore account.
Who sent the money?
I traced it back to a textile company here in town.
The CIA thinks it's a front for the SRS.
SRS is an international terrorist group made of the best former Soviet Union intelligence agents.
Redmond told us he's on a rampage for revenge and ideological reasons, but this half-a-million bucks makes me think that's just to throw us off.
Maybe this is really about money.
All right, so if these SRS guys are paying Redmond to terrorize the island, the question is: why?
I mean, it makes no sense, right?
I mean, if they wanted to hit us bad, they'd have far more impact on the mainland.
Guys, I don't think we're looking at the whole picture.
I think it's about something bigger.
I dug a little deeper, and I found more wire transfers to a systems analyst named Lawrence Turner.
Up until a month ago,
Turner was working for a local military contractor.
The CIA discovered he'd been using his security clearance to download thousands of classified documents.
And he started selling them, piece by piece.
Let me guess-- they were bought, paid for by the same textile company that slid Redmond the 500 racks.
Exactly.
Where's Turner now?
Well, that's what the CIA wants to know.
When they went to arrest him last month, he disappeared.
CIA thinks that Turner's still on the island.
They have their eyes on the ports and the airstrips.
And they've been monitoring the chatter ever since he fell off the radar.
They think he's never left.
(mechanical humming)
Whoa, Sarah Connor, I come in peace.
Jerry, what the hell is that?
It's how we're gonna stop our shooter.
Oh!
Easy, boy.
Check it out-- this thing creates an electromagnetic field which will disrupt our pilot's signal.
All you got to do is get me close enough to the drone, and this puppy will do the rest.
Oh, that's all.
Okay.
Well, how we gonna do that?
We give our shooter a little bait.
DANNY:
Bait?
Like, uh...
Oh, we're the, uh... the bait?

You got a better plan?

No, next week.

KONO:
Guys, air traffic control is reporting a small aircraft on approach.
No, no, no, no, no.
I thought we shut down the airport.
We did.
But this thing isn't landing at the airport.
It's headed for town.
Wait a minute.
We got this all wrong.
This is a...
this is an aircraft extraction.
The drone attack was just a diversion.
Right, they paid Redmond to clear the streets so they can land a plane and pick up Lawrence Turner.
If he gets on that plane, he'll compromise national security.
Steve.

Okay, okay.

Right after I started the task force,
Detective Danny Williams was my first hire.
You got no choice, Detective.
Governor gave me jurisdiction on making you my partner.
We're gonna get along great.
Right.
I personally wouldn't call it, um, a "hire."
It was more like a kidnapping.
A ransom.
It's the kind of thing, I didn't have a choice.
I liked his sense of humor.
You know, his personality.
You're right.
I don't like you.
When you're getting shot at, it is nice to reflect on what a nut job this guy is.
Tell me about the others.
Well, after Danny signed on, we recruited Chin Ho Kelly.
I can't be a cop anymore.
I'm the last person the department wants to see wearing a badge.
He was fired from the HPD at the time.
That's right, but we straightened that out.
Yeah, and then, uh, Kono Kalakaua-- that's Chin's cousin-- she was next.
I'mtoldshewasn'teven a police officer at the time.
So your cousin tells us you're graduating from the police academy next week.
How'd you like to earn a little extra credit before you do?
Yeah, she was a few weeks away from graduating from the academy.
But, uh, we needed a female, you see?
And she fit the bill.
And just recently, we recruited a former HPD SWAT commander named Lou Grover, from Chicago.
We want you to join Five-O.
So five people make up the Five-O task force?
Yeah, but we're, uh... we're more than a task force, you see.

You saved me a trip to ballistics.
You're welcome, Max.
What do we got on the victims?
They appear to have been shot in close proximity.
How close?
Dr. Shaw, care to opine?
Well, based on several identifiers, including multiple through-and-throughs,
I'd estimate ten to 15 feet, with a trajectory of approximately 45 degrees.
All right, who's your friend, Max?
This is Dr. Shaw.
She's a recent graduate of Johns Hopkins University.
I will be mentoring her in the medical arts.
Oh.
Well, lucky you.
You must be Detective Williams.
Yeah.
I have given her the full heads up.
You gave her the heads up on what?
It's all true.
I'm Steve McGarrett.
Welcome aboard, Dr. Shaw.
Nice to be aboard.
Okay, I don't get it.
So, if they were attacked at close range, what are we looking at here?
Very fit mugger with a serious automatic weapon?
Well, that would be a sound theory, except for I found both wallets, rental car keys and jewelry in their backpacks.
Maybe it was personal.
Perp knew they were climbing, was waiting for them at the top.
What do you got there, Danny?
Think we found our shooter.
You ever see anything like that before?
It's a UCAV.

So what are you saying?

Not on its own.

What you two should be keeping an eye on.
Ah, good point.
Girls in spandex.

Vintage books.
What about it?
Two weeks ago, the owner came back from a trip to Dusseldorf, where he purchased the entire inventory of a library that was closing down.
Get out of here.
Well, let's go arrest this guy.
What are we doing?
Not so fast, McGruff.
He hasn't committed a crime yet, but he's gonna-- trust me.
Okay, how do you know that?
That library in Dusseldorf was ancient.
And the books inside it were period.
The paper in those books-- 75% cotton, 25% ultrafine linen.
You know what that means?
I do.
It makes for good counterfeiting stock.
You, sir, are going to the head of the class.
Just 'cause he bought the books, it doesn't mean he's gonna recycle the paper and start printing bills, all right?
What else is he gonna do with them?
I don't know, maybe the vintage bookshop owner is-is gonna sell them.
No one reads hard-copy books anymore-- even I know that.
Jerry, you might be onto something here, okay?
But you can't be doing this.
You're a civilian.
I'm a seeker of truth.
You are also a, uh, conspiracy theorist, who still lives with his mother and has yet to file a tax return.

They treated me like I was some sort of nut job.
That's... shocking.
Jerry, I'll help you dig into this,
I promise, all right?
But right now, we need your help.
Take a look at this.
Whoa, not here.
We're too exposed.
What is that?
Where was this taken?
Here, on Oahu.
This thing was used in an attack this morning.
Left two people dead.
I've seen drones before, but I've never seen anything like that.
I reached out to my military contacts, but they wouldn't disclose much information due to operational security.
So I figured maybe you could help.
Okay, I'm pretty sure what we're looking at is a prototype domestic surveillance drone.
Minus the evil aftermarket weaponized payload, of course.
The government has been denying use of domestic drones for a very long time, all right?
That's why you hit a brick wall with the military.
Think they're gonna admit to violating your right to privacy?
Better chance of getting a backstage pass at Area 51.
Okay, what about a manufacturer?
Any ideas?
I seem to recall some chatter about a drone coming out of a super-secret advanced development program-- a branch of a local military contractor named VenPax Systems.
It could be your manufacturer.
Obviously, you didn't get that from me.
Obviously.
I'd like to help you guys out, but the truth is I can neither confirm nor deny that this particular UAV belongs to us.
You can't?
No.
Okay, well, maybe you can, uh, "confirm or deny"
that these people are dead.
Did you know them?
No.
Todd Sands and Tracy Powell-- they were here on vacation.
They got here on Monday, they went to a luau, and they did a tour of Waimea Falls Park.
And now they're dead, and I want to know why.
Look, you have to understand that this project is a matter of national security, so I can't just answer your questions without compromising what we're doing here.
And you have to understand, if you don't answer our questions, the only thing you're gonna be compromising is your freedom.
Commander, we're under contract by the military.
That means that we operate under their level of security.
So threatening me isn't gonna work.
Book him, Danno.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you hear what I just said?
Yeah, loud and clear.
Put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest for obstruction, withholding information, and impeding a murder investigation.
None of that's gonna stick, and you know it.
True.
But how many more government contracts do you think you're gonna get after a background check shows an arrest on your record?
Let's go.
Okay.
Okay.
All right, this is QV-901.
It's a surveillance drone with no other payload, which means it flies unarmed.
Three weeks ago, while it was on a routine test flight, it was hijacked, never recovered.
How do you hijack a drone?
GPS spoofing.
Somebody jammed VenPax's control signal to the UAV, fed it false GPS data, and made it land wherever the hijacker wanted it.
Okay, so what are we looking at here?
Inside job?
Security breach?
We don't know yet.
Uh, VenPax gave us a list of all their current and ex-employees that had clearance on the project, so we should run their names against the victims, see if we come up with a connection.
Right, and if we find one, that might explain motive.
I'll tell you something, takes a special kind of brilliance to hijack a drone, arm it and reprogram it.
We are dealing with one very smart, very sick son of a bitch.
Same drone that attacked our hikers this morning.
Witnesses say that it flew in, hovered, gathering a crowd, and then bang, opens fire.
Ten seconds later, we got five dead, 19 wounded.
Chin Ho and Kono are running I.D.'s right now to see if they can make any connection between the victims of both attacks.
One of my guys got a few shots off at the drone, trying to bring it down.
Bystander caught it on video.
That's good shooting.
If he had missed, more people would've been dead.
We can't find any correlation between the Kuhio Beach and the Diamond Head victims.
Which means the targets could be random.
All right, we need to start looking at this as an act of terrorism.
Except for the fact that no group or individual has claimed responsibility.
Well, maybe they're not done yet.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you're all here.
I got some more Intel on that drone you're looking for.
But first, a disclaimer.
Whatever I share with you today is in no way connected to me, my family or anyone I know.
I'm strictly here on a tour of the palace, nothing more.
Any attempt to associate me with the information I'm about to share will be vehemently denied by myself and the attorney I will retain.
Are we understood?
D-Do we...
Should we sign something, everybody?
Or just, "Get on with it,"
will that suffice, Jerry?
You're so naive about how this world really works.
Jerry, we get it.
Get on with it.
What do you got?
As far as drones go, they may be state-of-the-art, but the technology is still incredibly immature.
They are severely limited by a whole heap of engineering issues, such as an unprotected frequency band.
There's just not enough spectrum to go around.
Okay.
What does that mean in the language the rest of us speak?
It means that you can buy all the equipment you need to hijack a drone at your local hardware store.
You can?
Oh, good.
Well, then, um...
Go ahead.
That should cover it.
Go ahead.
Okay, not so fast, Donald Trump.
I can jack this thing from your shooter.
Only problem is, got to be within 200 yards from the drone to tap into the frequency.
Okay, so what you're saying is there's nothing we can do until it attacks again.
we have to be there when it attacks again.
Sarge, some guy just called claiming he's responsible for the drone attacks.
How do we know it's real?
He knew details we haven't released to the public.
Said he's gonna call back in ten minutes and wants to speak to someone in charge.
Patch him through to McGarrett.
Chin, run a trace.
We're on it.
Almost there.
Come on, Chin.
Come on, come on, Chin.
Come on, come on.
Almost there, almost there.
Almost there, almost there.
All right, go.
This is Steve McGarrett.
Who am I talking to?
You're going to have to do much better than that, Steve.
Oh, you think this is funny?
Seven people are dead, and there's a lot more in the hospital.
On the contrary, I think it's a tragedy.
But it's nothing compared to the hundreds killed by your drone attacks in the Middle East.
You're comparing sworn enemies of the United States to innocent civilians.
There were plenty of innocents killed in those attacks, too,
Commander McGarrett.
You of all people should know that.
So that's what this is about for you?
Revenge?
Is that right?
Justice.
Justice?
You want our government to apologize for keeping us safe?
No.
We are way past apologies.
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
So you're saying this isn't over?
Not by a long shot.
Okay, hold on.
Just hold on a second.
Wait.
Expect more blood in two hours.
Tell me you got that.
No.
He must have bounced that call off a dozen different relay stations and satellites.
Lou, call the HPD.
Tell them the island is under siege.
We need to get everybody off the streets right now.
The governor is asking everyone to remain indoors, away from windows and do not venture outside until further notice.
Now let's go through what we know right now.
A weaponized drone opened attack in Waikiki...
Let's go, let's go, everyone!
Let's go!
We got to get indoors!
Keep your keikis close!
Everyone get indoors!
Let's go, let's go, everyone!
Keep your keikis close!
Danno, what's going on?
Doesn't matter what's going on, all right?
Go inside, listen to your coaches, do as they say, and I will call you as soon as I can, all right?
All right, I love you.
Love you, too.
We need everyone off the beach right now.
...evacuate.
We need everyone inside.
Guys, check this out.
I broke down the drone pilot's call with a wave modulator and I unscrambled his voice.
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
Our mystery voice belongs to a Jonathan Redmond, an ex-VenPax employee.
He was fired three years ago for stealing company hardware.
VenPax had his voice print on file after Redmond made numerous harassing phone calls.
All right, did VenPax ever press charges?
No, they were worried that the company secrets would get out during a trial.
Yeah, well, no wonder they didn't mention Redmond to us.
A cancer like that could kill a billion-dollar contract.
But, lucky for us, Redmond continued his thieving ways and was arrested by HPD two years ago for several burglaries.
He served 18 months, then was paroled a few weeks ago.
All right, where do we find this punk?
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
Maybe he's operating it from a remote location.
Danny, call Chin;
have him run background on Redmond's family, friends, anybody who might know where he is.
Kono.
Hey.
You find Redmond?
No, he's keeping a low profile.
Okay.
Well, I ran his financials.
I found four wire transfers, totaling $500,000, deposited to an offshore account.
Who sent the money?
I traced it back to a textile company here in town.
The CIA thinks it's a front for the SRS.
SRS is an international terrorist group made of the best former Soviet Union intelligence agents.
Redmond told us he's on a rampage for revenge and ideological reasons, but this half-a-million bucks makes me think that's just to throw us off.
Maybe this is really about money.
All right, so if these SRS guys are paying Redmond to terrorize the island, the question is: why?
I mean, it makes no sense, right?
I mean, if they wanted to hit us bad, they'd have far more impact on the mainland.
Guys, I don't think we're looking at the whole picture.
I think it's about something bigger.
I dug a little deeper, and I found more wire transfers to a systems analyst named Lawrence Turner.
Up until a month ago,
Turner was working for a local military contractor.
The CIA discovered he'd been using his security clearance to download thousands of classified documents.
And he started selling them, piece by piece.
Let me guess-- they were bought, paid for by the same textile company that slid Redmond the 500 racks.
Exactly.
Where's Turner now?
Well, that's what the CIA wants to know.
When they went to arrest him last month, he disappeared.
CIA thinks that Turner's still on the island.
They have their eyes on the ports and the airstrips.
And they've been monitoring the chatter ever since he fell off the radar.
They think he's never left.
Whoa, Sarah Connor, I come in peace.
Jerry, what the hell is that?
It's how we're gonna stop our shooter.
Oh!
Easy, boy.
Check it out-- this thing creates an electromagnetic field which will disrupt our pilot's signal.
All you got to do is get me close enough to the drone, and this puppy will do the rest.
Oh, that's all.
Okay.
Well, how we gonna do that?
We give our shooter a little bait.
Bait?
Like, uh...
Oh, we're the, uh... the bait?
Where are you guys?
Kalakaua and Saratoga.
All right, just keep circling the block.
If our guy bites, we're two minutes away.
So stupid.
This is so stupid.
Okay?
It's stupid.
What?
What, what?
I'm chum, okay?
My life has been reduced to a piece of chum.
Thank you.
It's a solid plan.
It's a solid plan?
Now it's...
It's a solid plan hatched by a guy who believes that aliens are living amongst us.
You got a better plan?
I'd like to hear it.
What, like, right this second?
No, next week.
After we've enjoyed the traffic-free roads and the no wait for a table at BLT next week.
Hey, hey!
I don't need the sarcasm, okay?
I'm already risking my life.
I don't need the added sarcasm.
Okay, you don't like it, you can get out and walk.
How about that?
What is this, high school?
No, look.
Sir.
Sir.
Wake up.
Get up.
Wake up.
We got to get you inside, okay?
You got to get indoors, all right?
Go.
Steve!
Get down!
Get down!
Hey, hey!
We're taking fire on Koa and Ocean!
Hang on.
Steve, you all right?
Take cover.
Go.
Take cover.
Come on, get up, come on.
That thing's coming back.
We got to get out of here.
Come on.
I can't drive, Danny.
Oh, really?
There's a silver lining in the face of death.
Fantastic.
My leg will heal.
Don't get used to it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Faster, Danny.
Come on.
It's going fa...
This is as fast as it goes.
You know this.
You're not even redlining, okay?
Look, shut up, okay?
I don't know what's worse, your driving or your backseat driving.
Zip it.
Kono, go ahead.
We're a little busy.
Guys, air traffic control is reporting a small aircraft on approach.
No, no, no, no, no.
I thought we shut down the airport.
We did.
But this thing isn't landing at the airport.
It's headed for town.
Wait a minute.
We got this all wrong.
This is a...
this is an aircraft extraction.
The drone attack was just a diversion.
Right, they paid Redmond to clear the streets so they can land a plane and pick up Lawrence Turner.
If he gets on that plane, he'll compromise national security.
Steve.
I see it.
Lou, where are you?
Right behind you!
All right, come on, Jerry.
It's your turn.
This thing is gonna work, isn't it?
Theoretically.
No, no.
Wrong answer, Jerry.
Wrong answer.
Okay, okay.
It's gonna work.
I think.
I got a lock on its signal!
She's mine.
You got it.
All right!
One nasty killing machine down for the count!
Nice one.
Go, go!
Stop that plane.
I got this.
Jerry, check the transmission log.
It'll tell us where the pilot's operating from.
Copy, copy.
One will suffice.
Copy.
Okay, got it.
The operator's GPS coordinates are North two-one, dot, 288824, West 157 dot 852056...
Steve, the plane's starting to move.
It's taking off!
No way we're gonna stop that now.
Relax, partners.
I got this.
Jerry, what are you doing?
Feeling the Force.
Just like Skywalker on the trench run.
Hang on.
Yeah!
Son of a bitch.
He did it.
He really did it.
We got movement!
I got Turner!
On your knees!
Get your hands on your head!
Seven people are dead, even more injured.
For what?
A payday?
Isn't that why we get up in the morning?
That's what I get up for.
And this.
Turner!
It's over.
Lawrence Turner you're under arrest for espionage.
You know, you ought to look into whether they got some kind of a loyalty program.
Like, they'll give you a card, and every fifth bullet extraction is free.
Well, I'm certain such a program doesn't exist, Captain.
I believe he was joking, Max.
Ah.
I can see how that was an attempt at humor.
Oh, keep it up, wise guy.
You might see an attempt at murder.
Lou, he wasn't being rude.
He's-he's just Max, and you'll learn that.
You know, that reminds me, Max.
It's been killing me all day.
What did you tell your new protégé about me?
I beg your pardon?
Well, you said you gave her a heads up.
Heads up about what?
What did you say?
Oh, yes.
I just explained to Dr. Shaw that Commander McGarrett is the leader of Five-O, and that you're his deeply cynical, misanthropic, short-tempered partner.
What?
You know, I think I see what you mean about him.
Now, Dr. Shaw agreed with my assessment.
However, she did think you were cute.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Well, she got a point, right?
I can live with that.
What?
Brother, I thought you were shot.
I was.
In my thigh.
Thigh?
That don't count.
For you?
No, for you, it would not.
Thought you was down for the count.
I brought you some garlic shrimp and some balloons.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Maybe next time, they can hit a vital organ.
We be back.
Your chariot awaits, brave warrior.
All right.
Thanks, Jerry.
All right.
I'll see youse.
Hey, thanks.
Yup.
You're not coming?
No, no, no, I'm gonna take, uh, this opportunity to... have a nice drive in my car in private.
I thought your car was shot up.
Yeah, I'm gonna take the long way to the body shop.
See you guys.
Hey, Commander, you want to make a stop?
You can help me out with my surveillance.
Wow.
That's, uh...
that's tempting, Jerry.
But you know what?
I think I'd like to go home.
I've had enough excitement for one day.
Okay?
No, I got it.
Hi.
Hi.
Now... where were we?
Adam, there is nothing I'd like more than to be your wife.
So what's stopping you?
It's just everything that we've been through.
I just want to know that we're gonna be safe.
I can't go through that again.
Thinking I'm gonna lose you.
Hey.
Hey, you're not gonna lose me.
I promise.
You promise?
I promise.
When I heard you were coming to see me, I asked myself why.
And then I realized, it's the two-year anniversary of my sister's murder, which means you must be here to apologize for letting it happen.
You remember the $25 million in an offshore account you tried to bribe me with?
Internal Affairs has been watching me ever since you were arrested.
They think I have that money.
It's not my problem.
I want you to sign an affidavit saying that the money never changed hands.
Why would I do that?
Because maybe for once in your miserable life, you'll want to do something decent.
Let me think about it.
I'll get back to you.
Thank you, sir.
Who is he?
That's what we have to find out.
Because if he knows, we're gonna have to deal with that.
Grace?
Grace?
I believe Grace isn't due back from school for another half hour.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop.
What are you doing in my house?
Who are you?
I'm Marco Reyes.
Oh.
That supposed to mean something to me?
Your brother never mentioned me to you?
My brother...
No.
No, he didn't.
Well, I'm hurt.
Matt and I were so close.
What is it that I can do for you?
Your brother took something from me, and you're gonna help me get it back.

[PHONE RINGING]
So, uh, we have, uh, been together for three years.
Four.
See, this is, uh, specifically what I am talking about.
I'm just correcting you.
Okay.
Uh, four years.
It was three years, eleven months, two days, exactly.
You done?
CARLIN:
Detective Williams asked you a question.
When'?
He asked if you were going to allow him to finish his thought.
I'm-
- I'm sorry, whose side are you on?
CARLIN:
I don't take sides, commander.
I'm an objective observer.
As you know, the governor asked me to oversee the annual psychological audit of personnel, and I was concerned by what Detective Williams had to say.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Yeah, fine.
So we, uh, don't-- We don't agree on a few things.
But I don't see why that's such a big deal.
I'm gonna go ahead and stop you.
A few things?
We don't agree on anything.
Okay, name one.
Okay.
Um, I never get to drive my own automobile.
And I don't understand why you're angry about that.
I mean, I'd think you'd be grateful for being driven around.
Who am I?
Ms. Daisy?
- Sometimes I like to drive my own car.
- Sometimes you do drive.
Sometimes?
Are you saying that with a straight face in front of this woman?
Do you never drive your car?
I don't always drive your car.
I get to drive my car when you're not in it.
When I'm alone, I get to drive my own car.
Yeah.
That's sometimes.
Okay, you know what?
Fine.
You wanna know why you spend so much time in the passenger seat?
- Wanna know?
- This should be fanta-
- Yes.
- I get carsick if I don't drive.
- Ha, ha.
And he laughs.
And he laughs.
First time I've told him that.
Because it's ridiculous, okay?
He's a control freak.
He's a gigantic control freak.
It has nothing to do with motion, trust me, please.
CARLIN:
Detective Williams.
- Yeah?
Commander McGarrett is sharing something very personal with you.
Perhaps you could show him a little respect.
- But he's lying.
- I'm not lying.
He's a Navy SEAL.
- What has that got to do with it?
- Okay, okay.
- What has it got to do with it?
DANNY:
Please stop.
I don't really wanna be here, respectfully.
I'm sure he doesn't either.
If you're not gonna be honest,
- I'm gonna leave.
- I'm being honest.
CARLIN:
Gentlemen.
BOTH:
Yes?
This is a mandated review.
So let's continue, shall we?
- Fine with me.
- Yeah.
It's good.
- Why don't we shift gears a bit?
- All right.
Describe how you two first met.
[DANNY CHUCKLES]
DANNY:
Hands up!
- Who are you?
Who are you?
I am Detective Danny Williams.
Lieutenant Commander McGarrett.
- This is my father's house.
- Put your weapon down.
You put your weapon down and show me your ID.
- You show me your ID.
- I'm not putting my gun down.
Neither am I.
Four years ago,
Governor Jameson asked me to start a, uh, major-crimes task force.
And Dame--
I'm gonna stop-- See, he knows that I don't like that.
You're right.
Excuse me.
Sir Daniel.
This...is going right off the rails.
This right here--
Come on.
I'm teasing, all right?
Right after I started the task force, Detective Williams was my first hire.
You got no choice, detective.
Governor gave me jurisdiction on making you my partner.
We're gonna get along great.
Right.
I personally wouldn't call it, um, a hire.
It was more like a kidnapping.
A ransom.
It was the kind of thing-- I didn't have a choice.
I liked his sense of humor, you know, his personality.
You're right.
I don't like you.
DANNY:
When you're getting shot at, it is nice to reflect on what a nutjob this guy is.
CARLIN:
Tell me about the others.
Well, after Danny signed on,
- we recruited Chin Ho Kelly.
- I can't be a cop anymore.
I'm the last person the department wants to see wearing a badge.
CARLIN:
He was fired from the H.P.D. at the time.
That's right.
But we straightened that out.
Yeah, and then, uh, Kono Kalakaua-- That's Chin's cousin. --she was next.
CARLIN:
I'm told she wasn't even a police officer at the time.
Your cousin tells us you're graduating from the police academy next week.
How'd you like to earn extra credit?
Yeah, she was a few weeks away from graduating from the academy.
But, uh, we needed a female, you see, and she fit the bill.
And just recently, we recruited a former H.P.D. SWAT commander named Lou Grover from Chicago.
We want you to join Five-O.
CARLIN:
So five people make up the Five-O task force?
Yeah, but we're, uh, more than a task force, you see.
We're 'ohana.
Why the look, Detective Williams?
Oh, no look.
Um...
I guess I was just, uh, agreeing with him for the first time.
I think we're good.
MAN:
You're doing great, honey.
Keep going.
- Keep going.
- I can't.
Come on, just a few more steps.
The view, it's fantastic.
Hey, now.
You haven't turned around once.
What can I say?
I've got the best scenery right here.
Well, this scenery is gonna need an afternoon at the spa after this.
Deal.
Now hustle.
We're almost there.
You're gonna love what you see.
- Race you?
- You're on.
[WOMAN LAUGHS]
What is that?
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
[GUNFIRE]
Think you're gonna get a few of those waves next time?
[KONO LAUGHS]
- Aren't you gonna rinse off?
- I'd rather watch you.
Get over here.
[ADAM CHUCKLES]
You take such good care of me.
Have you thought any more about what we talked about?
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
KONO:
Ah.
- Sorry.
- Hey, it's okay.
- You gotta take it, right?
- Yeah.
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm on my way.
- Adam...
- Hey.
Don't ever apologize for doing your job, okay?
Go.
I'll take the boards home, okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
I'll see you later.
I'm heading to a crime scene.
Diamond Head Trail.
In case you lose me.
WOMAN:
Here you go.
McGARRETT:
What do we got, Lou?
Two dead, name of Todd Sands and Tracy Powell.
Both schoolteachers on the mainland.
I found this on the male vic.
Apparently, he was looking for a romantic spot to pop the question.
- Any witnesses?
- Just the birds.
These are 7.62 rounds.
This is military-issue.
Mahala, Commander McGarrett.
You saved me a trip to Ballistics.
You're welcome, Max.
What do we got on the victims?
They appear to have been shot in close proximity.
- How close?
- Dr. Shaw, care to opine?
Well, based on several identifiers, including multiple through-and-throughs,
I'd estimate ten to 15 feet, with a trajectory of approximately 45 degrees.
- All right, who's your friend, Max?
- This is Dr. Shaw.
She's a recent graduate of Johns Hopkins University.
I will be mentoring her in the medical arts.
Oh.
Well, lucky you.
- You must be Detective Williams.
- Yeah.
I have given her the full heads-up.
- You gave her the heads-up on what?
- It's all true.
- Heh.
- I'm Steve McGarrett.
- Welcome aboard, Dr. Shaw.
- Nice to be aboard.
Okay, I don't get it.
So if they were attacked at close range, what are we looking at here?
Very fit mugger with a serious automatic weapon?
That'd be a sound theory except for I found both wallets, rental-car keys and jewelry in their backpacks.
CHIN HO:
Maybe it was personal.
Perp knew they were climbing, was waiting for them at the top.
[GUNFIRE ON RECORDING]
McGARRETT:
What do you got there, Danny?
Think we found our shooter.
You ever see anything like that before?
It's a UCAV.
A combat drone.
So, what are you saying?
A machine did this?
Not on its own.
Someone somewhere pulled the trigger.
- What are you guys doing here?
- You first.
I'm on surveillance.
How'd you find me?
Your mother's car has an antitheft device.
Technology's not my friend.
Well, get in before you blow my cover.
No, no.
Wait.
I got it.
That's very 1988.
Okay, Jerry, I know I'm gonna regret asking this, but what is it that you are surveilling?
What you two should be keeping an eye on.
Ah.
Good point.
Girls in spandex.
Next door over.
Vintage books.
McGARRETT:
What about it?
Two weeks ago, the owner came back from a trip to Dusseldorf, where he purchased the entire inventory of a library that was closing down.
Get out of here.
Well, let's go arrest this guy.
- What are we doing?
- Not so fast, McGruff.
He hasn't committed a crime yet, but he's gonna, trust me.
Okay, how do you know that?
That library in Dusseldorf was ancient.
And the books inside it were period.
The paper in those books, 75 percent cotton, 25 percent ultrafine linen.
You know what that means?
I do.
It makes for good counterfeiting stock.
You are going to the head of the class.
Just because he bought the books, doesn't mean he's gonna recycle the paper and start printing bills.
- What else is he gonna do with them?
McGARRETT:
I don't know.
Maybe the vintage bookshop owner is gonna sell them.
No one reads hard-copy books anymore.
Even I know that.
You might be onto something here, okay, but you can't be doing this.
- You're a civilian.
- I'm a seeker of truth.
You are also a conspiracy theorist who still lives with his mother and has yet to file a tax return.
Listen to me.
Call the H.P.D. They can handle this.
I did call the H.P.D.
They treated me like I was some sort of nutjob.
That's, heh, shocking.
Jerry, I'll help you dig into this, I promise, all right?
But we need your help.
Take a look at this.
Ooh.
Not here.
We're too exposed.
WOMAN [ON VIDEO]:
What is that?
- Where was this taken?
- Here on Oahu.
This thing was used in an attack this morning that left two people dead.
I've seen drones before, but I've never seen anything like that.
I reached out to my military contacts, but they wouldn't disclose much, due to operational security.
So I figured maybe you could help.
JERRY:
Okay, I'm pretty sure what we're looking at is a prototype domestic surveillance drone.
Minus the evil aftermarket weaponized payload, of course.
The government has been denying use of domestic drones for a very long time.
That's why you hit a brick wall with the military.
[JERRY CHUCKLES]
Think they're gonna admit to violating your right to privacy?
Better chance of getting a backstage pass at Area 51.
Okay, what about a manufacturer?
Any ideas?
I seem to recall some chatter about a drone coming out of a super-secret advanced development program, a branch of a local military contractor named VenPax Systems.
It could be your manufacturer.
Obviously, you didn't get that from me.
Obviously.
I'd like to help you out, but I can neither confirm nor deny that this particular UAV belongs to us.
- You can't?
- No.
Okay, well, maybe you can, uh, confirm or deny that these people are dead.
McGARRETT:
Did you know them?
- No.
Todd Sands and Tracy Powell.
They were here on vacation.
They got here on Monday.
They went to a luau, and they did a tour of Waimea Falls Park.
And now they're dead, and I wanna know why.
Look, you have to understand that this project is a matter of national security, so I can't just answer your questions without compromising what we're doing.
You have to understand if you don't answer our questions, the only thing you're gonna be compromising is your freedom.
Commander, we're under contract by the military.
That means that we operate under their level of security.
So threatening me isn't gonna work.
Book him, Danno.
- Whoa.
Did you hear what I just said?
- Yeah, loud and clear.
Put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest for obstruction, withholding information and impeding a murder investigation.
None of that's gonna stick, and you know it.
True.
But how many more government contracts do you think you're gonna get after a background check shows an arrest on your record?
- Let's go.
- Okay.
Okay.
All right, this is QV-901.
It's a surveillance drone with no other payload, which means it flies unarmed.
Three weeks ago, while it was on a routine test flight, it was hijacked, never recovered.
- How do you hijack a drone?
- GPS spoofing.
Somebody jammed VenPax's control signal to the UAV, fed it false GPS data and made it land wherever the hijacker wanted it.
Okay, so, what are we looking at here?
Inside job?
Security breach?
We don't know yet.
Uh, VenPax gave us a list of their current and ex-employees that had clearance on the project.
We should run their names against the victims', see if we come up with a connection.
Right, and if we find one, that might explain motive.
I'll tell you something.
Takes a special kind of brilliance to hijack a drone, arm it and reprogram it.
We are dealing with one very smart, very sick son of a bitch.
[CHATTERING]
[PEOPLE SCREAMING]
[PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
[SIRENS WAILING]
Same drone that attacked our hikers this morning.
Witnesses say that it flew in, hovered, gathering a crowd, and then, bang, opened fire.
Ten seconds later, we got five dead, 19 wounded.
Chin Ho and Kono are running IDs right now to see if they can make any connection between the victims of both attacks.
One of my guys got a few shots at the drone, trying to bring it down.
Bystander caught it on video.
That's good shooting.
If he had missed, more people would've been dead.
We can't find any correlation between the Kuhio Beach and the Diamond Head victims.
Which means the targets could be random.
All right, we need to start looking at this as an act of terrorism.
Except for the fact that no group or individual has claimed responsibility.
- Maybe they're not done yet.
- Good.
I'm glad you're all here.
I got some more intel on that drone you're looking for.
But first a disclaimer.
Whatever I share with you today is in no way connected to me, my family or anyone I know.
I'm strictly here on a tour of the palace, nothing more.
Any attempt to associate me with the information I'm about to share will be vehemently denied by myself and the attorney I will retain.
Are we understood?
Do we--?
Should we sign something, everybody?
Or is "Get on with it--?" Will that suffice, Jerry?
You're so naive about how this world really works.
We get it.
Get on with it.
What do you got?
As far as drones go, they may be state-of-the-art, but the technology is still incredibly immature.
They are severely limited by a whole heap of engineering issues, such as an unprotected frequency band.
There's just not enough spectrum to go around.
Okay.
What does that mean in the language the rest of us speak?
It means that you can buy all the equipment you need to hijack a drone at your local hardware store.
You can?
Oh, good.
Well, then, um, go ahead.
That should cover it.
Go ahead.
Okay, not so fast, Donald Trump.
I can jack this thing from your shooter.
The problem is, you gotta be within 200 yards from the drone to tap into the frequency.
Okay, so, what you're saying is there's nothing we can do until it attacks again.
Correction:
We have to be there when it attacks again.
Sarge, some guy just called claiming he's responsible for the drone attacks.
How do we know it's real?
He knew details we haven't released to the public.
Said he's gonna call back in ten minutes and wants to speak to someone in charge.
Patch him through to McGarrett.
- Chin, run a trace.
- We're on it.
- Almost there.
- Come on, Chin.
- Come on.
Come on, Chin.
Come on.
CHIN HO:
Almost there, almost there.
All right, go.
This is Steve McGarrett.
Who am I talking to?
[CHUCKLES]
[DISTORTED] You're going to have to do much better than that, Steve.
Oh, you think this is funny?
Seven people are dead, and there's a lot more in the hospital.
DRONE PILOT:
On the contrary, I think it's a tragedy.
But it's nothing compared to the hundreds killed by your drone attacks in the Middle East.
You're comparing sworn enemies of the United States to innocent civilians.
There were plenty of innocents killed in those attacks too, McGarrett.
You of all people should know that.
So that's what this is about for you?
Revenge?
ls that right?
- Justice.
McGARRETT:
Justice?
You want our government to apologize for keeping us safe?
No.
We are way past apologies.
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
So you're saying this isn't over?
- Not by a long shot.
McGARRETT:
Okay, hold on.
- Just hold on a second.
Wait.
- Expect more blood in two hours.
- Tell me you got that.
- No.
He must have bounced that call off a dozen different relay stations and satellites.
Lou, call the H.P.D. Tell them the island is under siege.
We need to get everybody off the streets right now.

[PHONE RINGING]
[IGNITION BEEPING]
KONO:
Guys, check this out.
I broke down the drone pilot's call with a wave modulator, and I unscrambled his voice.
DRONE PILOT:
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
Our mystery voice belongs to a Jonathan Redmond, an ex-VenPax employee.
He was fired three years ago for stealing company hardware.
VenPax had his voice print on file after Redmond made numerous harassing phone calls.
All right, did VenPax ever press charges?
They were worried that the company secrets would get out during a trial.
No wonder they didn't mention Redmond to us.
A cancer like that could kill a billion-dollar contract.
But lucky for us, Redmond continued his thieving ways and was arrested by H.P.D. two years ago for several burglaries.
He served 18 months, then was paroled a few weeks ago.
All right, where do we find this punk?
DANNY:
Clear.
- Clear.
- Clear.
Maybe he's operating it from a remote location.
Call Chin, have him run background on Redmond's family, friends, anybody who might know where he is.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
- Kono.
- Hey.
You find Redmond?
No, he's keeping a low profile.
Okay.
Well, I ran his financials.
I found four wire transfers totaling $500,000 deposited to an offshore account.
Who sent the money?
KONO:
I traced it back to a textile company here in town.
The CIA thinks it's a front for the SRS.
SRS is an international terrorist group made of the best former Soviet Union intelligence agents.
Redmond told us he's on a rampage for revenge and ideological reasons, but this half a million bucks makes me think that's just to throw us off.
Maybe this is really about money.
All right, so if these SRS guys are paying Redmond to terrorize the island, the question is, why?
I mean, it makes no sense, right?
I mean, if they wanted to hit us bad, they'd have far more impact on the mainland.
I don't think we're looking at the whole picture.
It's about something bigger.
I dug a little deeper, and I found more wire transfers to a systems analyst named Lawrence Turner.
Up until a month ago,
Turner was working for a local military contractor.
The CIA discovered he'd been using his security clearance to download thousands of classified documents.
He started selling them, piece by piece.
Let me guess.
They were bought and paid for by the same textile company that slid Redmond the 500 racks.
- Exactly.
- Where's Turner now?
That's what the CIA wants to know.
When they went to arrest him last month, he disappeared.
CIA thinks that Turner's still on the island.
They have their eyes on ports and airstrips.
They've been monitoring the chatter since he fell off the radar.
They think he's never left.
[WHIRRING]
Whoa, Sarah Connor, I come in peace.
Jerry, what the hell is that?
It's how we're gonna stop our shooter.
Oh, easy, boy.
Check it out.
This thing creates an electromagnetic field, which will disrupt our pilot's signal.
All you gotta do is get me close to the drone.
- This puppy will do the rest.
- That's all.
Okay.
How we gonna do that?
- We give our shooter a little bait.
DANNY:
Bait?
Like, uh...?
Oh, we're the, uh-
- The bait?
JERRY:
Where are you guys?
- Kalakaua and Saratoga.
Just keep circling the block.
If our guy bites, we're two minutes away.

This is so stupid.
- Okay?

- What?
What, what?
I'm chum, okay?
My life has been reduced to a piece of chum.
- Thank you.
- It's a solid plan.
It's a solid plan?
Now it's--?
It's a solid plan hatched by a guy who believes that aliens are living amongst us.
You got a better plan?
I'd like to hear it.
- What, right this second?
- No, next week.
After we've enjoyed the traffic-free roads and the no wait for a table at BLT next week.
Hey, I don't need the sarcasm, okay?
I'm already risking my life.
I don't need the added sarcasm.
Okay, you don't like it, you can get out and walk.

[CELL PHONE RINGS]
Kono, go ahead.
We're a little busy.
Guys, air traffic control is reporting a small aircraft on approach.
No, no, no.
I thought we shut down the airport.
We did.
But this thing isn't landing at the airport.
It's headed for town.
Wait, we got this all wrong.
This is an aircraft extraction.
The drone attack was just a diversion.
Right, they paid Redmond to clear the streets so they could land a plane and pick up Lawrence Turner.
If he gets on that plane, he'll compromise national security.
DANNY:
Steve.
McGARRETT:
I see it.
McGARRETT:

[YELLS]
Lawrence Turner, you're under arrest for espionage.
You ought to look into whether they got some kind of a loyalty program.
Like they'll give you a card, and every fifth bullet extraction is free.
Well, I'm certain such a program doesn't exist, captain.
I believe he was joking, Max.
Ah.
I can see how that was an attempt at humor.
Oh, keep it up, wise guy.
You might see an attempted murder.
Lou, he wasn't being rude.
He's just Max.
And you'll learn that.
That reminds me, Max.
It's been killing me all day.
What did you tell your new protégé about me?
- I beg your pardon?
- You said you gave her a heads-up.
Heads-up about what?
What did you say?
Oh, yes.
I just explained to Dr. Shaw that Commander McGarrett is the leader of Five-0 and that you're his deeply cynical, misanthropic, short-tempered partner.
What?
I think I see what you mean about him.
Now, Dr. Shaw agreed with my assessment.
However, she did think you were cute.
McGARRETT:
Hey.
- Aha.
Well, she's got a point, right?
I can live with that.
What?
Brother, I thought you were shot.
- I was.
In my thigh.
- Thigh?

I thought your car was shot up.
Yeah, I'm gonna take the long way to the body shop.
See you guys.
Hey, commander, you wanna make a stop?
You can help me out with my surveillance.
Wow, that's, uh...
That's tempting, Jerry, but you know what?
I think I'd like to go home.
I've had enough excitement for one day.
Okay?
No, I got it.

Hey.
You're not gonna lose me.
I promise.
You promise?
I promise.
[DOOR BUZZES THEN OPENS]
When I heard you were coming to see me, I asked myself why.
And then I realized it's the two-year anniversary of my sister's murder, which means you must be here to apologize for letting it happen.
You remember the 25 million in an offshore account you tried to bribe me with?
Internal Affairs has been watching me ever since you were arrested.
They think I have that money.
It's not my problem.
I want you to sign an affidavit saying that the money never changed hands.
Why would I do that?
Because maybe for once in your miserable life, you wanna do something decent.
Let me think about it.
I'll get back to you.
Thank you, sir.

That library in Dusseldorf was ancient.
And the books inside it were period.
The paper in those books-- 75% cotton, 25% ultrafine linen.
You know what that means?
I do.
It makes for good counterfeiting stock.
You, sir, are going to the head of the class.
STEVE:
Just 'cause he bought the books, it doesn't mean he's gonna recycle the paper and start printing bills, all right?
What else is he gonna do with them?
I don't know, maybe the vintage bookshop owner is-is gonna sell them.
No one reads hard-copy books anymore-- even I know that.
Jerry, you might be onto something here, okay?
But you can't be doing this.
You're a civilian.
I'm a seeker of truth.
DANNY:
You are also a, uh, conspiracy theorist, who still lives with his mother and has yet to file a tax return.
Listen to me, call the HPD;
they can handle this.
I did call the HPD.
They treated me like I was some sort of nut job.
(laughs):
That's... shocking.
STEVE:
Jerry, I'll help you dig into this,
I promise, all right?
But right now, we need your help.
Take a look at this.
Whoa, not here.
We're too exposed.
TRACY:
What is that?
(mechanical clank)
(automatic gunfire)
Where was this taken?
Here, on Oahu.
This thing was used in an attack this morning.
Left two people dead.
I've seen drones before, but I've never seen anything like that.
I reached out to my military contacts, but they wouldn't disclose much information due to operational security.
So I figured maybe you could help.
JERRY:
Okay, I'm pretty sure what we're looking at is a prototype domestic surveillance drone.
Minus the evil aftermarket weaponized payload, of course.
The government has been denying use of domestic drones for a very long time, all right?
That's why you hit a brick wall with the military.
(laughs)
Think they're gonna admit to violating your right to privacy?
Better chance of getting a backstage pass at Area 51.
Okay, what about a manufacturer?
Any ideas?
I seem to recall some chatter about a drone coming out of a super-secret advanced development program-- a branch of a local military contractor named VenPax Systems.
It could be your manufacturer.
Obviously, you didn't get that from me.
Obviously.
VENIT:
I'd like to help you guys out, but the truth is I can neither confirm nor deny that this particular UAV belongs to us.
You can't?
No.
Okay, well, maybe you can, uh, "confirm or deny"
that these people are dead.
STEVE:
Did you know them?
No.
Todd Sands and Tracy Powell-- they were here on vacation.
They got here on Monday, they went to a luau, and they did a tour of Waimea Falls Park.
And now they're dead, and I want to know why.
Look, you have to understand that this project is a matter of national security, so I can't just answer your questions without compromising what we're doing here.
And you have to understand, if you don't answer our questions, the only thing you're gonna be compromising is your freedom.
Commander, we're under contract by the military.
That means that we operate under their level of security.
So threatening me isn't gonna work.
Book him, Danno.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you hear what I just said?
Yeah, loud and clear.
Put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest for obstruction, withholding information, and impeding a murder investigation.
None of that's gonna stick, and you know it.
STEVE:
True.
But how many more government contracts do you think you're gonna get after a background check shows an arrest on your record?
Let's go.
Okay.
Okay.
All right, this is QV-901.
It's a surveillance drone with no other payload, which means it flies unarmed.
Three weeks ago, while it was on a routine test flight, it was hijacked, never recovered.
How do you hijack a drone?
GPS spoofing.
Somebody jammed VenPax's control signal to the UAV, fed it false GPS data, and made it land wherever the hijacker wanted it.
KONO:
Okay, so what are we looking at here?
Inside job?
Security breach?
We don't know yet.
Uh, VenPax gave us a list of all their current and ex-employees that had clearance on the project, so we should run their names against the victims, see if we come up with a connection.
Right, and if we find one, that might explain motive.
I'll tell you something, takes a special kind of brilliance to hijack a drone, arm it and reprogram it.
We are dealing with one very smart, very sick son of a bitch.

Same drone that attacked our hikers this morning.
Witnesses say that it flew in, hovered, gathering a crowd, and then bang, opens fire.
Ten seconds later, we got five dead, 19 wounded.
Chin Ho and Kono are running I.D.'s right now to see if they can make any connection between the victims of both attacks.
One of my guys got a few shots off at the drone, trying to bring it down.
Bystander caught it on video.
That's good shooting.
If he had missed, more people would've been dead.
We can't find any correlation between the Kuhio Beach and the Diamond Head victims.
Which means the targets could be random.
All right, we need to start looking at this as an act of terrorism.
Except for the fact that no group or individual has claimed responsibility.
Well, maybe they're not done yet.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you're all here.
I got some more Intel on that drone you're looking for.
But first, a disclaimer.
Whatever I share with you today is in no way connected to me, my family or anyone I know.
I'm strictly here on a tour of the palace, nothing more.
Any attempt to associate me with the information I'm about to share will be vehemently denied by myself and the attorney I will retain.
Are we understood?
D-Do we...
Should we sign something, everybody?
Or just, "Get on with it,"
will that suffice, Jerry?
You're so naive about how this world really works.
Jerry, we get it.
Get on with it.
What do you got?
As far as drones go, they may be state-of-the-art, but the technology is still incredibly immature.
They are severely limited by a whole heap of engineering issues, such as an unprotected frequency band.
There's just not enough spectrum to go around.
Okay.
What does that mean in the language the rest of us speak?
It means that you can buy all the equipment you need to hijack a drone at your local hardware store.
DANNY:
You can?
Oh, good.
Well, then, um...
Go ahead.
That should cover it.
Go ahead.
Okay, not so fast, Donald Trump.
I can jack this thing from your shooter.
Only problem is, got to be within 200 yards from the drone to tap into the frequency.
KONO:
Okay, so what you're saying is there's nothing we can do until it attacks again.
Correction: we have to be there when it attacks again.
Sarge, some guy just called claiming he's responsible for the drone attacks.
How do we know it's real?
He knew details we haven't released to the public.
Said he's gonna call back in ten minutes and wants to speak to someone in charge.
Patch him through to McGarrett.
Chin, run a trace.
We're on it.
Almost there.
Come on, Chin.
Come on, come on, Chin.
Come on, come on.
Almost there, almost there.
Almost there, almost there.
All right, go.
This is Steve McGarrett.
Who am I talking to?
(laughing)
(voice scrambled):
You're going to have to do much better than that, Steve.
Oh, you think this is funny?
Seven people are dead, and there's a lot more in the hospital.
On the contrary, I think it's a tragedy.
But it's nothing compared to the hundreds killed by your drone attacks in the Middle East.
You're comparing sworn enemies of the United States to innocent civilians.
There were plenty of innocents killed in those attacks, too,
Commander McGarrett.
You of all people should know that.
So that's what this is about for you?
Revenge?
Is that right?
Justice.
Justice?
You want our government to apologize for keeping us safe?
No.
We are way past apologies.
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
So you're saying this isn't over?
Not by a long shot.
Okay, hold on.
Just hold on a second.
Wait.
Expect more blood in two hours.

Tell me you got that.
No.
He must have bounced that call off a dozen different relay stations and satellites.

MAN (over P.A.):
We need everyone off the beach right now.
(sirens whooping) ...evacuate.

KONO:
Guys, check this out.
I broke down the drone pilot's call with a wave modulator and I unscrambled his voice.
MAN:
America needs to be reminded what it's like to be terrorized.
To be afraid to step outside.
Our mystery voice belongs to a Jonathan Redmond, an ex-VenPax employee.
He was fired three years ago for stealing company hardware.
VenPax had his voice print on file after Redmond made numerous harassing phone calls.
All right, did VenPax ever press charges?
No, they were worried that the company secrets would get out during a trial.
Yeah, well, no wonder they didn't mention Redmond to us.
A cancer like that could kill a billion-dollar contract.
But, lucky for us, Redmond continued his thieving ways and was arrested by HPD two years ago for several burglaries.
He served 18 months, then was paroled a few weeks ago.
All right, where do we find this punk?
DANNY:
Clear.
Clear.
Clear.
Maybe he's operating it from a remote location.
Danny, call Chin;
have him run background on Redmond's family, friends, anybody who might know where he is.
(cell phone ringing)
Kono.
Hey.
You find Redmond?
No, he's keeping a low profile.
Okay.
Well, I ran his financials.
I found four wire transfers, totaling $500,000, deposited to an offshore account.
Who sent the money?
I traced it back to a textile company here in town.
The CIA thinks it's a front for the SRS.
SRS is an international terrorist group made of the best former Soviet Union intelligence agents.
Redmond told us he's on a rampage for revenge and ideological reasons, but this half-a-million bucks makes me think that's just to throw us off.
Maybe this is really about money.
All right, so if these SRS guys are paying Redmond to terrorize the island, the question is: why?
I mean, it makes no sense, right?
I mean, if they wanted to hit us bad, they'd have far more impact on the mainland.
Guys, I don't think we're looking at the whole picture.
I think it's about something bigger.
I dug a little deeper, and I found more wire transfers to a systems analyst named Lawrence Turner.
Up until a month ago,
Turner was working for a local military contractor.
The CIA discovered he'd been using his security clearance to download thousands of classified documents.
And he started selling them, piece by piece.
Let me guess-- they were bought, paid for by the same textile company that slid Redmond the 500 racks.
Exactly.
Where's Turner now?
Well, that's what the CIA wants to know.
When they went to arrest him last month, he disappeared.
CIA thinks that Turner's still on the island.
They have their eyes on the ports and the airstrips.
And they've been monitoring the chatter ever since he fell off the radar.
They think he's never left.
(mechanical humming)
Whoa, Sarah Connor, I come in peace.
Jerry, what the hell is that?
It's how we're gonna stop our shooter.
Oh!
Easy, boy.
Check it out-- this thing creates an electromagnetic field which will disrupt our pilot's signal.
All you got to do is get me close enough to the drone, and this puppy will do the rest.
Oh, that's all.
Okay.
Well, how we gonna do that?
We give our shooter a little bait.
DANNY:

Oh, hey boys.
Hey, thank you.
Oh sweet...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, you can't have a beer.
Just let me hold it, it's Christmas.
Okay, knock yourself out.
This my band, bro.
We got Anton, Pete, c.J.
Yo, yo, yo!
C.J., we had a t.J. That's nuts.
Sriracha are like gods to us, bro.
Oh, that's awesome, look at you, you got the posters.
Whatever happened to you guys, man?
Things...
I don't know, the... the, I don't know, life happened. [Laughter]
Yeah, the band broke up...
I'm not sure, exactly, when.
Oh, as the chief editor of sriracha's Wikipedia page,
I can' help with that.
The last known concert appearance by sriracha was February 19th, 2005.
- There you go.
- Yeah, yeah.
So what've you guys been doin' since, huh?
Oh, you know, this and that, nothing much.
Oh, as chief editor of Will Freeman's Wikipedia page,
I can help with that as well.
I don't think these guys wanna hear about the boring details of my life after sriracha, Marcus.
What's so boring about writing runaway sleigh, one of the most popular Christmas songs of the decade?
You wroterunaway sleigh?
I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but yeah, yeah I did.
You sellout!
Bad thing, yeah, I was kinda leaning that direction.
You destroyed sriracha.
Uh,runaway sleighhad nothing to do with sriracha breaking up.
Get out!
Okay, well this has been horrific.
Um, I'm gonna go upstairs to your attic and get some boxes...
No, there's nothing up in the attic, bro.
This woman came by about a year ago, cleared out all the boxes.
Yeah, milady said she used to play tambourine for you guys.
Okay.
Out of the house, sellout.
Okay, you gonna take my beer and not the kid's?
I'm not gonna take the kid's beer, he didn't destroy sriracha.
Stop, the sign on the door says "closed."
Yeah, yeah, but the door was open.
Well, most of our customers can read.
Oh, well that's not nice, is it?
Now, we need a snow machine, that's all we need.
It's Christmas Eve, the snow machines have been sold out for weeks.
Yeah, but listen.
My son is starting not to believe in the magic of Christmas.
And so, if I can give him a white Christmas here in California, that would restore his belief.
So please, you have to sell me or rent me a snow machine.
Please.
And what about that baby, right there?
It's a return.
It burnt someone's garage down yeah, but you could fix that, couldn't you?
You could fix it with your tool belt, handy Andy Andy, come on.
Come on, with your little tool belt?
How... how big of a fire are we talking about?
Massive.
I have serious doubts about that.
Okay, good, we'll take it.
Okay, so it's true debby caruso played a little tambo for sriracha, but let's just say she was more like my main squeeze at the time.
Supermodel's face, dancer's body, style like Audrey hepburn.
Oh, I'm looking for debb caruso?
Oh, my God, Will!
Debb...
What did you do to debb?
Oh, what are you doing here, come inside, come inside.
Kids, come here, come here!
You're not going to believe it, this is my old bandmate, Will.
Kids, this is Will Freeman, mommy's special friend from before daddy.
That's kind of icky.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
Hi, bill, this is Will Freeman.
I was just telling your wife how highly Will speaks of her.
He said she breaks records for endurance.
Running partners, five ks.
Felt more like ten ks, Will.
Did you find a picture frame with the oldrunaway sleigh lyrics in them?
Oh, I sold them on ebay.
You sold my lyrics on ebay?
You know what, I might have the fedex receipt in my ebay box, I'll go and look, okay?
- Okay, great.
- Hey, Will, do you think that maybe you could sing a few lyrics from runaway sleigh for my kids?
Oh, absolutely not.
All: ♪ won't you ride in my runaway sleigh ♪
♪ The reindeer might be biting but they seem to know the way ♪
♪ And we can fly these presents to the good girls and the boys ♪
♪ And we'll all have a merry Christmas ♪
♪ And we can fly these presents to the good girls and the boys ♪
♪ And we'll all have a merry Christmas ♪
Oh, hey, now I understand why you hate Christmas.
You hate Christmas because you hate runaway sleigh, and you hate runaway sleigh because it just reminds you of how much time has passed.
Everybody's moved on with their lives but you're just kind of stuck in neutral.
[Buzzer sound] Wrong again.
Okay.
812...
Hill grass Avenue.
Where are we, Will?
Might wanna stay outside for this one, Marcus.
[Cello music]
Dad.
Well...
Look what the cat dragged in.
O.M.G. You're Will's dad.
History is happening before my eyes.
Great penmanship, by the way.
Oh, can you guys pose, cause I'm gonna take a little picky for the wiki.
Marcus, we're not gonna pose.
Even better, candid.
Let me guess, his mom was a groupie and he's my grandson.
Good one.
No, he's my neighbor's kid.
Look, I really don't want to be here, and I'm obviously interrupting a super weird party, so I'll get right to the point.
I need my runaway sleigh lyrics.
Somebody at this address bought them.
I'm assuming it was mom before you torpedoed the marriage and she moved to Florida.
But if you do have them, I need them.
Are you gonna come in?
Fine.
I'm walking into Will's childhood home.
Oh, I'm gonna journal about this so hard.
Ooh, it smells like toast.
But it looks like a bomb.
I'm turbo charging this baby so Marcus can have a very white Christmas.
Oh, how confident are you, Andy?
Well, shooting for quadruple output, but I'd settle for double.
Great.
Now who's that?
Who's that bloke with Will,
Marcus keeps texting me pictures.
- That's Will's dad.
- [Gasps]
How lovely.
Not lovely.
Explosive, actually.
Here you go.
One eggnog.
Okay, thanks.
Uh, there's liquor in that.
That's all right, he likes to hold liquor.
Well, what do ya say, you wanna sit down at the piano and play something?
Really?
You... who am I gonna play for?
These guys?
I mean, they look like they're waiting for the bus.
Where are my lyrics?
- How is your mother?
- Can we skip the small talk, please?
Just asking.
She's lousy, that's how she is, okay.
Her stubborn husband wouldn't leave his dingy-ass, hell hole in Berkeley and move to Florida with her.
What was I gonna do in Florida?
I don't know, be with your wife, have dinner at 3:00 P.M., live in the beautiful house
I bought you?
Oh, that place was way, way too big for us.
Oh, baloney, that's- you couldn't stand to live in a house that I bought you because then you'd have to admit that I'd made it, my way.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the fact that the minute I left classical music and pursued the music that I loved, you couldn't deal with it.
That's not the way it was, Will.
Now it's true, I never have understood your music, but I was always fine with pursuing anything you loved.
No, it was when you sold that silly song and then you stopped.
You just up and stopped trying.
I stopped trying?
I stopped trying 'cause I don't play weddings on the weekends for $50?
All right, listen Will, I don't want to fight with you, it's Christmas Eve.
I'll tell you what, why don't we just play that brahms concerto in d minor, that was always...
We're leaving.
Where are my lyrics?
I don't have your lyrics, Will.
You're gonna have to call your mother.
Okay.
Marcus, we're leaving.
Say goodbye to your friends.
Would it have hurt you so much to just say,
"you wrote a hit song, Will, and you made a lot of people happy at Christmas, and I'm proud of you"?
Would it have killed you?
Come on, Marcus, your mom's expecting us.
Oh, I think I finally understand.
You hate Christmas because you hate runaway sleigh, and you hate runaway sleigh because it ruined your relationship with your father.
Come on, Marcus, let's get out of here.
Choir: ♪ sharing so much joy and cheer ♪
♪ Sharing so much joy and cheer ♪
Oh, it was a real yule log of a day.
[Sighs]
You know, it's funny.
I used to think, you know, "why does dad love penguins
"more than he loves me?
Why can't he be more of a dad?"
You know, hang around the house, watch TV, live on the same continent?
But the problem is, you can't pick your dad.
But the cool thing is, is you can pick your friends.
And I'm really glad you picked me.
You're a really, really wise person, Marcus.
Thanks, Will.
Ow, stop, it's too hard.
You know, sometimes it helps me to howl.
What's that now?
Well, my mom taught me that, when I'm upset about things, you know, big things, it's healthy to howl.
Yeah, I'm not sure that's a universally recognized wisdom.
[Howling]
Marcus...
Uh, Marcus, we're in public.
Marcus, you gotta stop, I'm not gonna howl with...
Both: [Howling]
I just got a text from Marcus, they'll be here in a minute.
You guys ready for a white Christmas?
All:
Yeah.
I said, are you ready for a white Christmas?
Oh!
Oh!
Dad's hanging off the roof!
Oh, my...
You clumsy idiot.
I am not gonna raise four children by myself.
Andy!
Andy!
Oh, quick...
let's... just...
Grab on.
[Screams]
Oh, my God.
All right, Andy.
I am so sorry, Fiona.
Oh, no, it's all right.
I mean, you're not dead.
Plan a was a disaster, but we'll get a plan b.
I don't have a plan b.
But you know, it's Christmas.
- I almost died.
- That's what you get for trying to be a show off.

Look, I wanted to give you a white Christmas.
I wanted you to remember there's magic in Christmas, no matter what Will says.
After seeing Will and his dad tonight,
I don't need Santa, or snow machines, or fancy lights, all I need is you, mom.
You are my Christmas.
Oh, I'm your Christmas, you're my Christmas, darling.
I don't suppose you'd like to stay for some eggnog, would you?
Actually, Fiona, I would love to stay for some eggnog.
And if it's okay with you, I'd love to stay and celebrate
Christmas, too.
Oh, we'd love to have you.
- Thanks.
- Do you hear that, kids?
It's a Christmas miracle, Uncle Will's gonna spend Christmas with us.
God bless us, every friggin' one.
In fact, could you draw up the papers, I wanna sign and just end this crazy lawsuit and settle.
It's too late, dummy, stalker Stacey withdrew the offer.
We're going to trial.
You could lose everything, Will.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
That sucks.
Okay, wow.
All right, well, who cares, you know?
We're here.
We could've all spent Christmas on our own, but we have chosen each other.
I think that's cause for celebration.
All right, so let's bring it in.
I'm not sure this is a Christmas thing, it's more of a sports thing, but...

Hey, guys.
Do I want to know about the racing gear?
- I can explain.
- No, actually, I was asking myself.
Do I want to know about the racing gear?
No, Patrick, you don't.
This girl I'm dating wants to do some motocross later and the outfit's a little snug, so I'm stretching it out.
You know why it's snug, don't you?
Yeah, because my girlfriend picked it out and I look awesome in it.
No, because when you break every bone in your body, it'll keep them in the general shape of a human skeleton.
Well, that's not true.
Is that true?
Yeah.
I was totally in love with a guy who did motocross.
But he broke his spine and when they put him back together, he was shorter than me, so, you know, he had to go.
Well, I'm not worried.
It's just racing on a dirt track with a couple of jumps.
Kids do this all the time.
And super cool adults.
So anybody got anything else they want to discuss?
Yeah, I do.
And I'm really excited.
You know that money my dad's giving me to start a new business?
Wait a minute.
Her father's giving her more money?
The only thing my father ever gave me was a healthy suspicion of people that look like her father.
I think your father gave you a healthy suspicion of everybody who wasn't white.
That's true.
He was a good man.
Anyways, after seriously considering what I could offer the world to make it a better place,
I've decided to start a really expensive line of shoes.
I think that's great.
And so does 1% of the rest of the world.
But the best news is Lacey's decided to make me her new shoe company's head designer.
And I've already got a ton of ideas.
The Patrick wedge.
The Patrick heel.
And a sandal I'm calling the Lacey.
I'm not really happy with the design yet.
Eventually it'll be called the Patrick.
Hold on a second.
I'm your boyfriend and you never called me for help.
Why didn't you want me involved?
Oh, well, this is important to me and I don't trust you.
That came out wrong.
What I meant to say is
I don't trust you with this or anything else that's important to me.
I think that that came out wrong, too.
Charlie, could you help me out here?
No, I think you got a great hole going.
I say keep digging.
What about you, Charlie?
You trust me, don't you?
Of course I do.
I think you're an incredibly capable young man who everybody underestimates at times.
Thank you.
At least someone respects me.
Yeah, a grown man dressed like a 12-year-old boy who's going dirt biking with a bunch of kids.
And cool adults, okay?
And cool adults.
Anger Management 2x83 Charlie The Return of the Danger Girl
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What happened to your arm?
- Remember Allie?
The waitress with the glass eye?
That was Ellie.
The lawyer that called you Your Honor during sex?
That was Sally.
This is Allie, the girl that was into having sex in dangerous places.
So you hurt your arm having sex?
Where, in your backyard?
My backyard, what?
Your backyard is dangerous.
I stepped on a rake the other day.
In cartoons that's funny, in real life it hurts like hell.
Actually, we were racing dirt bikes.
She's over having sex in dangerous places.
Now she's into having sex after doing dangerous things.
Like what?
Well, we've been speedboat racing, rock climbing.
The closer she comes to cheating death, the greater the sex is.
She's a sexual adrenaline junkie.
That is a problem.
She's gonna get crazier and crazier until somebody gets seriously hurt.
That's not gonna happen.
She's not pressuring me to do anything I don't want to do.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go put Neosporin on any place that I still have skin.
Oh, my God, bungee jumping was so hot.
My heart is still pounding.
Feel.
Oh, my God.
On the way down, did you keep your eyes open or closed?
I don't know.
I was pretty much watching my childhood go by.
( Laughs ) Oh, Charlie,
I love that you're up for anything.
Well, real men fear nothing.
Except maybe the boredom of going bungee jumping a second time.
How boring would that be?
Boring.
No, I want to do something way crazier next time.
Something that I've never done before.
Have you ever been skydiving?
Uh, skydiving?
You're not scared, are you?
Why would I be scared?
I love July 4th at the ballpark.
I can't believe that anyone can jump from a plane and land on that tiny target in center field.
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen, look to the skies as our founding fathers George Washington and Ben Franklin fly through the air and land on the Declaration of Independence.
Shouldn't George Washington's parachute be open by now?
Gonzalez!
Get off the mound!
(Thuds) Oh!
Oh, my God.
Wait, where's Ben Franklin?
I don't know.
I don't see him.
( Thuds )
( Screaming )
You want to know what's really scary?
A Ferris wheel.
Ferris wheel?
Well, sure.
One loose pin, that thing goes rolling down the Santa Monica Pier taking out jugglers, mimes, children.
It's a mess.
Well, I've always wanted to jump out of a plane.
So if you're good to go, so am I.
Yay, skydiving.
Oh, I am so excited.
Are you excited?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I feel like
Ben Franklin on the 4th of July.
- Wayne, can I ask you something?
- Shoot.
Do you have any fears that you just couldn't get over?
No, but I've come across plenty of people who have.
My usual advice is,
"Shh, it'll be over soon."
Why, you got some sort of fear you can't get over, Charlie?
Well, I'm supposed to jump out of a plane with my girlfriend.
Don't be afraid.
Parachute accidents happen all the time.
No one's gonna believe you killed her.
I don't want to kill her, Wayne.
You know, maybe I should ask someone else.
This is relationship talk and you're more of a love 'em and leave 'em in a landfill kind of guy.
Sometimes I don't even love 'em.
Hey, Jordan.
You ever done any research on overcoming fears?
- Like what?
- Oh, I don't know.
Like, maybe skydiving.
Actually, I have.
My research turned up a lot of evidence to support that people with a fear of skydiving have lower testosterone and smaller genitals.
As a matter of fact, eunuchs throughout history...
All right, all right.
I know that you know that it's me, okay?
Yeah.
That was fun.
Why are you going skydiving?
Well, I'm dating this girl who gets off on doing dangerous stuff.
And the sex afterwards is always amazing.
So you're willing to risk your life for amazing sex?
Hey, I've risked my life for other stuff.
I once dove into a rushing river to save a puppy and all that did was make some stupid kid happy.
Thanks for mixing up sex with a story about a puppy.
Anything else you want to destroy for me?
I got laid in the back of a Build-A-Bear one time.
I don't want to hear it!
Look, I don't know what to do.
I'm jumping this weekend and I have to get over this fear.
Fine, I actually have done some research in this area and I can come over and help you.
But all I'm gonna get out of it is making some stupid kid happy.
Yay, I'm gonna have great sex.
We realize this is very late notice, Mr. Wangchuck, but we have a trade show coming up next week and we're wondering if we could get samples of our shoe line immediately.
I designed them.
These are the pictures.
Do you like them?
I designed them.
Very nice.
Cutting edge.
You start whole new fashion trend.
So can you get them to us that quickly?
Oh, yeah.
If you need them back in five days, we have them here in four.
Sign contract.
You be very happy.
Did you hear that, Patrick?
We be very happy.
I be very happy right now.
Uh, yeah, that's great.
Sorry, just one quick question.
This picture of your factory floor, those aren't children, are they?
No.
We are a race of small, adorable, hairless people.
But they looked so unhappy.
Not at all.
In Bhutan, this is how we smile.
So those aren't children?
No, they're adults.
Because they looked like they were nine.
In Bhutan, you become an adult at eight.
Vote at nine.
Drink at 10.
- I'm sold.
- No.
I will not have my shoes made by second graders.
Who would normally be doing what?
Like, finger painting?
At least this way they'll be making how much?
Two cents a day.
Which is a lot in Bhutan, right?
No.
We're out of here.
I can find someplace else.
I will not have the blood of children's hands on my shoes.
That never happen.
We make them wear gloves.
You're a monster.
We make monster costume for Halloween.
Kids love to wear and make.
Only little bit flammable.
Okay, look, I'm not afraid of being on my roof.
I'm afraid of jumping out of an airplane.
I know.
We're gonna do some visualization exercises where I have you imagine that you're about to jump out of a plane.
I just figured it would be best if we were closer to the sky, you know?
You know I had sex up here once?
We were gonna do it under the stars, but we wound up doing it under a news chopper.
They never found that cat burglar, but the whole neighborhood could identify my ass.
Charming.
Now I want you to close your eyes and visualize that you're in the plane.
The doors are open, you can feel the wind on your face.
( Trilling )
- What's that?
- That's the engine.
( Trilling ) That doesn't sound good.
This bucket of bolts is going down.
This does not feel like I'm skydiving.
( Sighs ) Fine.
I filled this backpack with books so that it was the same weight as a parachute.
Put it on and maybe that'll make it feel more real.
I'm not putting that thing on.
I'll just fall off the roof.
You are not going to fall.
Here, I'll show you.
( Screams )
Holy crap.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
I fell into the bushes, but I think I twisted my ankle.
Well, thank God that's all.
Why didn't you pull your chute?
(Jordangroans) Too soon?
Here's your not-too-cold, mountain spring, not-from-America bottle of water.
That's better.
So what we did up there, did it help you?
Well, let's see, I saw someone get injured falling from nine feet up, so multiply that injury by 1,000 feet and that's how much it helped.
(Doorbellrings) Oh!
Did you order a pizza?
We could sit here, watch a movie and make a night of it.
No, that's Nolan.
I called him to take you home.
You've only been here an hour and I'm ready to jump off the roof.
Hey, Charlie.
Got the limo.
Where's the patient?
I'm over here, Nolan.
Can you grab my stuff?
It's in the kitchen.
Sure.
So how'd it happen?
She put on this backpack...
Say no more.
Those things are a hazard.
You might as well strap on a rabid monkey.
Nolan, I don't say this enough as your therapist, but you are a fascinating man.
So why were you on the roof?
She was trying to help me get over my fear of skydiving.
Oh, I can help you do that.
I've jumped dozens of times.
I spent the summers working at my uncle's skydiving school.
Well, thanks, Nolan, but you helping me could really cripple our doctor-patient relationship.
Especially if I end up crippled.
I'm serious.
I really know what I'm doing with this.
It's not like building a career or managing finance or trying to create a super pet by crossing a Chihuahua and a fruit bat.
Why would you do that?
A fruit bat is already basically a flying Chihuahua.
I know.
You don't think I want those years back?
Come on, Charlie.
You said that you trusted me in group.
Now is your chance to prove it.
- I know, but...
- I get it.
You don't trust me with anything important.
No one does.
Nolan's an idiot.
Fine.
Good-bye.
Nolan, I trust you.
Just with different important things.
Oh, yeah?
Name one thing.
Okay.
I trust that if I had a date coming over and she loved Hot Pockets that you'd know which flavor pairs best with Sunny D.
You didn't even try.
It's ham and cheese!
( Knocking )
( Gasps ) Oh, my God, they're here.
I told you we'd find a local factory that would finish it in time.
Look at all these boxes of shoes.
It's like Christmas or any other day when I buy myself a lot of shoes.
They're beautiful.
I'm trying them on.
Yes, they're beautiful, but I also designed them to be uncomfortable.
That's how you know they're expensive.
You want comfortable shoes, go to Target.
Oh, my God.
The heel broke.
Are they all like that?
Relax.
Probably just one bad apple.
I'm sure the rest are fine.
Well, the rhinestones are just coming off of this one.
You know what?
I knew this would happen.
We should have let the Bhutanese kids do it.
I refuse to give my money to a sweatshop.
They're sweating because they're doing it right.
Calm down.
I'm sure we can just pop the rhinestones back into place.
Oh, my fingers are too big.
What are we going to do?
The trade show is tomorrow.
I'll tell you what we're not going to do.
We are not going to freak out.
Get back in there, you stupid little hillbilly diamond!
(Doorbellrings) I'll get it.
Is Mr. Fitzpatrick home?
I have the cookies he ordered.
Oh, my.
Your hands, they're so small and dainty.
Patrick, look.
Wow.
Maisy, can you pop this rhinestone back into place?
Sure.
( Gasps ) Wasn't that fun?
Do you like cookies?
Yeah, but we just sell them.
We're not allowed to eat them.
Well, that doesn't seem right.
Wow, thanks.
Those must be hard to eat without milk.
You want some milk?
Well, you can have all the milk you want right after you call the rest of your troop and get them over here for a big milk and cookie arts and crafts fix that box of shoes party.
You know, Nolan, I usually don't say this to a lot of customers, but the way you eat disgusts me.
You know why you don't say that to a lot of customers?
Because they take back their tips.
Oh, no, there goes the home I was building in France.
Nolan, where the hell have you been?
You're not returning my texts, haven't been to group all week.
Because I know what you're gonna say.
You're really sorry you didn't trust me and to make it up to me, you're gonna buy me a new car.
Well, I am sorry, but I'm not gonna buy you a new car.
There we go.
I'm not sure how much of this abuse I'm expected to take.
Look, I've been thinking about it past couple of days, and I would really love for you to help me with the skydiving.
Really?
You trust me enough to put your life in my hands?
When you hear it out loud, it kind of hits in a different way.
But, yes, yes.
I need a pro and you're a pro.
All right, but I can only teach you once we're up in the plane.
My uncle showed me a special technique for helping nervous jumpers.
Oh, he was a great man.
God rest his crushed and shattered soul.
What happened, his chute didn't open?
No, he died in his sleep.
He was 92 years old.
Oh, thank God.
He nodded off during his last jump and was blown into the gorilla habitat at the San Diego Zoo.
The gorillas took it from there.
Well, they are kind of territorial.
I am so gonna grab your ass on the way down.
The instructor was very clear about maintaining proper spacing.
Your leg is really sweaty.
I think that's your hand, not my leg.
Probably because you're nervous.
There, there.
Allie, you're up.
It's my turn.
Last one to earth is a rotten egg.
Whoo-hoo!
Make a note.
Her last two words were whoo and hoo.
You're up, Charlie.
It's my turn and so far you haven't done anything to help me.
I'm freaking out here.
There's plenty of time for this to work.
Now, just stand up.
And close your eyes.
Try to relax.
Okay, what next?
This!
( Screams )
He was wearing the chute, right?
Let's go, girls.
Time is cookies.
Can I take a break?
I'm tired.
You've already had your break.
But you can drink all the coffee you want.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Oh, of course, dear.
Just past the kitchen.
Take your work.
Take your work.
Can you open a window?
It smells bad in here.
It smells bad in here because your sister puked.
She's four.
She's eating the glue.
And this is her nap time.
Well, I'm 30 and this is my nap time.
My God, look what we've done.
I know.
I'm so proud of us making our product in America.
Hey, you two, stop talking.
- Last thing we need is a union.
- Mm-hmm.
( Knocking )
Coming.
- Hey.
- Hey, Charlie.
You got a minute?
Nolan, you and I talked.
We're good.
And I'm with Allie right now passionately celebrating the fact that I'm not dead.
It won't take long.
I know you forgave me after you jumped, but just in case there's any hard feelings,
I want to give you this plant.
Oh, well, that's very sweet.
It's an African milk bush.
Couple things... it's got to be inside, but in direct sun.
You got to feed it three or four times a day and water it when it's dry to the touch.
You got to repot it during the peak growing season, which is between June and July, but you can only use a clay pot.
And there's a small chance it could be full of red spider mites.
You won't know until they're in your carpeting.
Well, thank you for the apology.
And for my new part-time job.
You sure you're not mad at me?
'Cause I could swear you were cussing me out after I pushed you out of the plane.
Nolan, you helped me get over a major fear.
I was yelling, "Thank you, Nolan.
Thank you."
Then why did you say, "Go thank yourself"?
Because I thought you should have given yourself some credit too.
Charlie, I just figured out what we should do next.
There's a place where you can swim with sharks.
And just to make it more exciting, they put you in a cage covered in meat.
I don't know what else to say except "thank you."
So we're good?
Yeah, yeah.
But I got to break up with her.
Can I give her this plant?
Sure.
Shit!
Hurry up with the bags.
That's all?
As part of our ongoing coverage, preparations continue for the first meeting of the Asean Counter-Terrorism Council.
Given the successful coordination of recent operations against global terrorist threats, and because of the successful signing of the new regional peace accord,
Manila has been chosen as the location for the Council's inaugural meeting, coinciding with the Philippine's annual Independence Day celebrations.
Here we go!
Right knee, right knee, here we go!
Nice and hard!
Left knee!
Good.
Again!
Give it back!
Come on!
Come on!
One more!
Breathe, breathe.
Nice.
Tap!
Nice.
Double tap!
Good!
This time, double tap and elbow!
There you go.
Nice.
Good.
Keep your hands up.
Chin down.
Nice and tight.
Coming at you hard.
Ready?
Again.
- You feel that?
- Yes, sir!
I'm not kicking the pad, I'm trying to kick you.
You do that to me.
Let's go.
Okay, let me see a nice, easy push-kick.
- Nice!
- That good enough?
Yeah, that's good.
It feels good.
Do it again.
Come on, double jab!
Nice, nice.
Left elbow.
Relax.
Again.
Nice.
Captain Randall.
- Reyes.
- Your orders, sir.
All right, Reyes, get the men up and ready to roll in 30 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant Barnes, we are on the clock.
Gentlemen, listen up!
Lieutenant Barnes, you have the floor.
This is Sayid Nassif.
He's a trained engineer and a demolition expert, with a long history of terrorism across the globe.
He's fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, and recently formed a partnership with a radical terrorist faction group in Southern Mindanao.
Yesterday, he hijacked a truck owned by a local mining company hauling TNT to a test site.
Also, the government has reported a considerable amount of cesium-137 missing.
- Intel believes there is a connection.
- Is he trying to build a dirty bomb, sir?
We don't know for sure.
We do know he's transporting the material deeper into insurgent territory and collaborating with...
Abdul Malek.
Known insurgent and son of terrorist leader,
Omar Malek, the man responsible for the 2004 embassy bombings.
And the recent attacks in Kuala Lumpur..
Lights.
- Sir.
- Del Rio.
- Where's the intel coming from?
- An informant in Malek's ranks.
The insurgents are meeting in four hours at a factory warehouse in Zamboanga City.
Our mission is to secure the TNT and the cesium and eliminate the leadership.
Any questions?
We step off in 15 mikes.
Let's do this.
Captain.
A word with you before you leave?
Of course, sir.
We have reason to believe that Nassif is planning to set off a series of bombs in the metro Manila area.
One of those targets is this weekend's Counter-Terrorism Conference.
Won't the American DNI be present there, sir?
Yes, he will.
Along with a lot of other very important people in the same field.
Right now, we have no credible intelligence as to his plan of attack.
Consequently, it is imperative that you guys bring in both Nassif and Malek alive for questioning.
I don't want any loose cannons out there, you copy?
- Yes, sir.
- You inform the men.
Will do, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, General.
Abdul.
Sayid.
Peace be with you.
And also with you.
All is well.
The cesium is with my father at the camp.
Alpha to War Dog.
We have eyes on.
What's your position?
Over.
Sentry's in my sight.
Waiting for your orders, sir.
Over.
We need to leave as soon as possible.
Of course.
More men are on the way.
Take the shot, War Dog.
Remember, we need the leaders alive.
Over.
Don't be a fool!
Our enemy is hunting us down at this very moment we speak.
Sleep tight, motherfucker.
- You have been betrayed!
- Me?
You must have been followed!
You have jeopardized the entire mission!
You, upstairs
You, other side!
Hurry!
Abdul can fight for himself.
Move out!
Barnes, on me.
Clear!
Hicks, Del Rio, check upstairs!
McCray, on me!
I got a back door here, sir.
The intel is fucked!
Drive!
The gear's stuck!
McCray!
Disable the engine!
Make it work!
Grenade!
Sergeant, I told you we needed the leadership alive.
- Sir, I thought...
- No, you didn't think!
- You reacted!
- They had us pinned down, Captain!
I blew the toss.
Additional reports from local investigators suggest that the truck explosion at a warehouse in Zamboanga City earlier today was caused by a police operation against drug dealers that resulted in the death of innocent civilians.
Claims of this being...
Man, they got no clue what's going on out there.
They're about to get one.
I found this online.
One of those workers had a fucking video camera.
Shit, man.
Does the Captain know yet?
Back in '69, I nailed a VC counter-sniper at 1,000 yards.
Now, I can barely hit that goddamn piece of paper.
- What happened out there, Captain?
- Sir, I take full responsibility.
That's not what I asked you.
We needed the rebel leaders alive.
Sir, the intel was sparse, and the maps we were given were inaccurate, sir.
Right now, the foreign press has your face plastered all over TV and they're claiming that you killed innocent civilians.
It's only a matter of time before the insurgents come after you.
I'm pulling you out of the field, Captain.
Sir, with all due respect, isn't that a bit extreme?
It's all political bullshit, but I have no choice.
You're a target now.
Till further notice, you're off the mission.
Dismissed, Captain.
Hi.
Miss Wallace.
Hey, Dad.
Thank you for the invite.
Thanks for coming, kid.
Well, now that you're a contractor, I figured you could use the practice.
- I get too much practice.
- Safety's on, gun's hot.
Excellent.
Hey, I'm looking forward to Thursday.
I hope I like this one better than the others.
- I know you'll at least respect him.
- Really?
A real man?
Well, I'll be the judge of that.
Aziz, look.
It's Sayid.
Abdul is dead.
He fought bravely with his men to the last.
But somehow you still live.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you as well.
It was a good death.
A death with honor.
And you?
Did you fight with honor?
You stand here before me without even a scratch!
Our fight together has just begun.
They killed my son like a filthy animal!
Abdul died for the cause and for Allah.
If you let his death distract you from our purpose then you disgrace him.
We need weapons and supplies to build explosives.
The General's daughter could be worth millions of dollars.
We will kidnap her.
But the man who killed my son will beg me for death before I cut out his heart!
General Castillo, Secretary Rivera, thank you very much for being here today.
I must say, Miss Wallace, lam surprised to see a woman so young in charge of security for this conference.
I can assure you, Mr. Secretary,
Miss Wallace is at the absolute top of her profession.
You're very kind, General.
Whatever I have accomplished,
I owe it all to my training with Naval Intelligence.
How does this device protect the conference attendees?
Very simple, sir.
Danny.
The array sends interference signals over a broad range of the spectrum, identifying threats and jamming them.
No signal, no bombs.
What about a timed explosive?
Our intelligence agencies are on top of it.
They're much easier to detect.
Are you assuring me that the conference is totally safe?
You have G-Tech's word on that, sir.
I hope that would be enough.
Thank you, Miss Wallace.
Thank you.
- General.
- Mr. Secretary.
- General.
- Miss Wallace.
See you tomorrow.
Why, hello.
It's Captain Randall, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
And, Miss Wallace, you are looking mighty fine, as usual.
- May I offer you a ride?
- Of course.
- I think you should spend the night.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
- What time is it?
I'm not telling you.
I should go.
What?
It's not even dark yet.
Are you coming on Thursday?
I'm not sure yet.
There's a lot going on.
There's always a lot going on with you, Max.
- What are you doing?
Where are you going?
- I told you, I'm going home.
Don't get upset.
We've been dating for months.
Am I just another adventure for you, or do you want to get serious?
I thought we were serious.
Come here.
This is for you.
This is a key to your apartment.
Yeah.
Thank you.
But I do think we need to talk about this.
We just did, Max.
Take it or leave it.
Take it or leave it?
Jenna, there's a lot to our lives that make things complicated.
Life is complicated, so what?
What does that have to do with making a commitment to someone...
- ...you say you care about?
- I care about you!
It's just...
I'm not gonna wait around for you, Max.
I want a family and I want a life.
And I need to be open with my dad about us, so, if you're not there on Thursday for dinner with Dad,
I think it's time for us to be apart for a little while.
- There's the Cap.
- Excuse me.
Hey, Captain.
- Hey, guys.
How you doing?
- Doing great.
- All right.
- You're not leaving, are you?
Actually, I've got paperwork due in the morning.
Reyes, Del Rio, you guys...
- You have a round on me.
That's an order.
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Hey, Captain.
- Yeah.
You okay?
I'm just a little tired, Sergeant.
You have fun tonight.
- Hey, good to see you.
- You, too.
I really appreciate you doing this.
I hope it didn't ruin your day off.
No, not at all.
Just lock up, okay, or else Mr. Kotas will kill me.
- You got it.
- Here you go.
See you tomorrow.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
Tuck your shirt in.
Get him in!
Get him in!
Faster!
Remember, don't kill him.
Meet us at the camp.
- Max.
- Jenna, where are you?
- I'm at the gym, why?
- Get to the base now.
- Max, what...
- I don't have time.
Jenna?
Jenna!
Shit.
Miss Wallace.
The chloroform.
Jenna!
Hank.
Something terrible's happened.
You will pay $5 million, or we will cut off her head.
Your greed and your brutality will cost you this time.
You are like an animal to me.
I took you!
I own you!
Don't test me.
We will cut off her head.
I'll get the money.
I have good friends.
I own you!
Hank, you've been temporarily relieved of duty until this matter is resolved.
What are you talking about?
General Brown feels that your judgment is compromised.
He can't do that.
You'll get official notification within the hour.
Untie the woman.
Take off his hood.
Eduardo.
Turn around.
They're going to cut off our heads, aren't they?
Look at me, Eduardo.
We're not gonna die here.
I promise you.
Okay?
General Wallace.
- Did you get that GPS chip?
- Yes, sir.
The insurgents may try to take you again.
I buried your suspension.
According to official records, it never happened.
Thank you, sir.
Your new orders.
You find my little girl, Captain.
Whatever it takes, you bring her back.
I will, sir.
Sir.
At ease, Galloz.
Why don't you take five?
Aye, sir.
You're gonna tell me where Omar Malek is.
I am not telling you shit!
I think you will.
Have you ever met Major Santiago?
Now, I can't lay a hand on you, but I can damn well turn you over to the Major and we both know what he will do to you.
That is unless you tell me where Omar Malek is.
I swear...
I swear, I don't know.
Well, you better tell me who does.
His name is Ahas.
Spent about 15 years in the Filipino prison system.
Funnels money for terrorist groups in Mindanao.
Funds his operation trafficking drugs and women.
- You have his location in here?
- Yes, sir.
Good job, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
Are you okay, Private?
It's Reyes, sir.
He was his cousin.
Hey, Del Rio was like a brother to me.
It's time for some fucking payback!
- Nobody fucks with us without getting theirs!
- No mistakes out there, gentlemen.
This is not a blood feud, it's a mission.
All right, Marines, listen up!
We're heading 30 clicks down the Bolong River to detain an enemy facilitator for questioning.
This man right here.
Our mission is to uncover any information related to the whereabouts of Jenna Wallace.
We'll then move forward to secure the hostage, and eliminate the leadership within Omar Malek's ranks.
Sir, are we taking custody of the enemy facilitator?
That's a negative.
After we question him, we'll turn him over to Intel for further debriefing and move forward with our mission.
- Any more questions?
- No, sir.
Zodiac's moving out in 10 minutes.
Gentlemen, let's fucking do this!
Yeah.
Excitement continues to build for the Asean Counter-Terrorism Conference scheduled to begin this weekend.
Among the dignitaries arriving, is the Chief of Security from China who flew in early this morning.
The Spanish representative was eagerly awaited yesterday, but did not exit his limo to greet the crowds.
Security is a key concern at all events, but officials seemed confident.
Be precise with your measurements.
I'll take care of it.
I rechecked the seals.
No leaks.
What about the TNT?
Blended with the nitromethane.
Devised for maximum dispersal of the cesium.
But will there be enough?
Set off just one of these at the conference dozens will die in an instant.
But within a week, thousands more will suffer and die slowly.
Sir!
Help us!
She isn't breathing right!
Something's very wrong!
Sir, she can't breathe and I don't know...
Turn around.
Keep your hands up.
Get up.
I said, get up!
Damn, that hurt.
Safety's off and there's a round chambered.
Your finger off the trigger guard till you're ready to fire.
- How do you know this stuff?
- I used to be a Marine.
- You can do this, okay?
- Okay.
Just don't shoot me in the back.
On your knees.
On your knees.
- Clear.
- Stack up.
Turn around!
Shut the fuck up and stay down!
I wanna see your hands on your heads!
- Status?
- Clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!
All clear!
You listen to me carefully!
I am not here for you or your stash!
I need some information about Omar Malek.
If you cooperate, this does not have to be hard.
- Yes, boss.
-"Yes, boss," what?
"Yes, boss" you gonna talk?
- Yes, boss.
- Where is Omar Malek?
- Yes, boss!
- Get your fucking face on the floor!
You wanna die?
You talk!
Or I'm gonna fucking kill you!
You wanna die right now, motherfucker?
I'll count you.
Go.
Okay, head for the truck.
Go.
- Any chance you can hot-wire a car?
- I'm from Manila.
Go for it.
Shit!
Shit!
- Sorry!
- Get out now!
Drop the weapon.
Drop your weapon.
Put down your weapon!
You!
Over there!
Drop your weapon!
Tie them up!
Hurry!
Tie them up!
- Two clicks in, is there a path?
- Yeah.
What do you have for me, Hicks?
Looks like it's about two clicks east of the Bolong River, sir.
Show me.
Here's the Bolong River, but there's a guard house.
- The camp is two clicks inland.
- Good job, Private.
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, listen up!
We're handing the enemy facilitator off to Intel in five and the Zodiac is leaving in 10.
Check your gear and be ready to move out.
Lieutenant.
You really think the Captain was gonna smoke that guy in there?
Of course not.
This is Captain Randall with Alpha Squad.
Come in.
I think he was.
He's not acting himself.
Focus on the mission, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Copy that.
Alpha Squad out.
Get his head on the block and bring me my sword!
Please don't do this!
I'll give you anything!
I barely know this woman!
I beg you!
My God!
I don't want to die!
For Allah!
My God!
Omar.
Omar.
We cannot acquire the ransom money if you kill her.
Be silent!
- I told you very simple.
- Omar.
If you disfigure her in any way...
We may lose millions of dollars.
That is enough!
Alpha to Hannibal.
- Any sign of the hostage?
Over.
- It's a negative.
Moving in position now.
Over.
- Alpha to Hannibal.
- Hannibal.
Over.
I've got eyes on the hostage.
She in a small shack at the southeast corner of the camp.
Contact Command.
Inform them I'm moving in.
Over.
They may only be delaying the payment.
We have to wait.
They have ten minutes for the money to appear in the account.
Give them more time.
She is worth a fortune to us.
My son is dead because of men like her father.
If he won't pay me then I will kill his child in turn.
Do it!
Start up the video!
Omar, be reasonable!
Ten minutes then she dies.
The General's seriously considering that this mission will be a failure.
Sir!
General Castillo advises you not to enter the Control Room.
General Wallace, I don't think you should be here.
My daughter's out there.
You think I give a shit about procedure?
What's the sitrep?
Randall's team has found her.
This is Lieutenant Barnes of Task Force 5456.
Captain Randall has eyes on the hostage.
I repeat, Captain Randall has eyes on the hostage.
Requesting permission to secure.
Over.
Get Randall in there.
Get Randall in there!
Hank, we have to be cautious.
Malek and Nassif are inside that compound!
She could get killed in the fire fight!
Sir, I just lost the connection.
My daughter dies in that jungle, I'll kill you.
Hannibal, what's the word from headquarters?
Over.
I've lost connection, sir.
Hannibal to Alpha.
Got eyes on Nassif and Malek.
Request permission to fire.
Over.
That's a negative, Hannibal.
Repeat, negative.
We cannot jeopardize the safety of the hostage.
Get the bird in the air now.
Over.
Copy that.
Calling Naval Command now.
General, Camp Navarro just received a live video link.
It's Miss Wallace, sir.
Play it.
Your time has run out.
We have been degraded long enough by the filthy West, defiling our home with their greed.
We stand for it no more.
No one is safe from our wrath.
Let this American be a symbol to the world.
They will bleed as we have bled.
Allah will grant us revenge.
The time has come.
The one true God will not abandon his followers!
Those who defy his will shall be slain!
By Allah!
Get the image back up.
I'm sorry, sir.
Lost the feed.
I knew you'd come get me.
I'm here.
Hannibal to Alpha.
Enemy on the move.
Do you copy?
Over.
Copy that, Hannibal.
Moving to contact now.
Over.
- Can you move?
All right.
- Yeah, I can move.
Let's go.
Stay close.
Alpha to Hannibal.
We have secured the hostage.
- Moving to rendezvous point.
- Copy that!
Call in close air support!
Dropping smoke!
Move out!
Call in air support!
Connection established, sir.
This is Lieutenant Barnes, Attack Force 5456.
Requesting HEPD on grid!
9-7-3-7-2-6-9-5-4!
McCray, moving out!
Get down!
Get down!
McCray, take the civilian!
Move out!
Let's go!
Move it!
Go, go, go!
Hannibal to Alpha.
Closing in on Charlie now.
Enemy in hot pursuit.
I repeat, enemy in hot pursuit.
Do you copy?
Over.
- Barnes, where are we?
- River's half a click north, sir.
All right.
You guys get the civilian to safety.
I'll cover your retreat.
Alone, sir?
I'll get up to the hills and meet you at rendezvous point Bravo.
If I don't show up, call the Task Force.
Max, what are you doing?
Come with me!
You listen to me.
If you don't go now, it'll all be for nothing.
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- You go.
- McCray, get her out of here.
- We gotta move out.
- Max, you mustn't.
- Go!
Don't worry, Miss Wallace.
Captain Randall's gonna be just fine.
- Find him.
- I will.
Move out!
Move, move!
Yo, we gotta move!
I'm going back for the Captain, sir.
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point.
- That was not the Captain's orders!
- Come on, Lieutenant!
He's all alone out there.
Okay.
Good luck.
Stay in radio contact.
- Let us know when you find him.
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant, I gave you an order!
- Civilian is secure, sir.
And I'm not letting you die out here alone.
Pressure on the wound!
Pressure on the wound!
Fuck!
- Fuck me!
- I'm all right.
You saved my ass, McCray.
You saved my ass.
God!
- Get me home, Captain.
- I'm gonna take you home, Sergeant.
- I'm taking you home.
- Fuck.
I'm gonna take you home, Sarge.
You're going home.
You're going home.
Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Hank.
We've got her.
- She all right?
- Bruised up some, but yeah, she's okay.
- Where is she?
- She's on her way.
It's okay.
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.
I thought I'd lost you, kid.
I thought I'd lost you.
- It's so good to see you.
- It's okay now, baby.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
Any word on Max?
No.
Not yet.
It's okay, baby.
Okay.
A luncheon was held with officials responsible for assuring the safety of dignitaries attending the Asean Counter
- Terrorism Conference.
A visit to the Presidential Gardens was in order prior to the formal luncheon.
Security officials were upbeat due to the fact that introductions of the many representatives attending the conference went off without a hitch earlier today.
The satellite dish has been moved and is ready to place.
The bombs are primed and in position.
I want as many casualties as possible.
But the priority is to kill government officials at the counter-terrorism conference... and especially the American Director of National Intelligence.
He'll be blown away to pieces.
How can you be sure?
There are bombs in the street and a bomb in the conference hall and we'll detonate it from here while he gives his speech.
Remember to hide the dish from the drones.
We'll position it near the tree line for maximum range.
From the air it will be concealed.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, General.
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
- What can I do for you?
- I have some bad news.
When I was at the rebel camp, I saw a satellite dish with technology
I didn't think was possible to achieve here in the southern islands.
What exactly?
Components that could flood a system like G-Tech with enough alternating frequencies to bypass the jammers.
We'll have to find that satellite dish before it enters the Metro Manila area.
That's just it, sir.
If I'm right, they don't need to move it.
This system is powerful enough to set off a bomb from 1,000 miles away.
In his mercy, Allah brought you to me.
Justice will be done.
Cut him down!
Now!
Get back!
I'm going to kill him alone... with my bare hands!
Get up!
Get up.
I win!
Miss Wallace, you have any idea what I had to do to get you this mission?
- You won't regret it.
- Your father will be furious.
- Are you sure you're up to this?
- I'm the only one who qualified to do the job.
An air strike may or may not be possible when we locate the satellite dish.
If it needs to be disassembled, I'm the only one on base who can do it.
Do you have the GPS monitor locked on Captain Randall's new position?
Yes.
Listen, you're doing the right thing.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
I'll see you when I get back.
Jenna!
Jenna.
- Don't do this.
- I don't have a choice.
No one else can disable the dish, and Max risked his life for me.
- I can't leave him there alone.
- He's a Marine.
That's his job.
You don't owe him anything.
I have to stay focused right now.
I can't talk to you right now.
I've got a job, too.
I love you.
I'm not leaving without Captain Randall!
Neither are we.
Enemy fire!
Albatross to Base Command.
We got a chopper down.
What's the order?
Over!
Copy that, Albatross.
Proceed to rendezvous point Delta.
Over.
Okay, Marines, listen up!
We got a mission to complete!
Let's go get Captain Randall!
What's the status on the downed helicopter?
No survivors, sir.
Christ.
Is team Alpha on their way back to base camp?
Team Alpha is proceeding with the mission objective.
We're working on getting reinforcements now.
What the hell are you talking about?
You can't take out an enemy camp with a squad!
The objective is not to take out the camp.
The objective is to rescue Randall and destroy the satellite dish without killing civilians.
My daughter's on that ship, Lito.
She has to lead this team.
She is the most valuable person on that mission right now.
She's the only one who can shut down the dish if an air strike fails.
Look, Hank, I'm sorry.
General.
General!
General.
Hank.
What are you doing?
I'm not letting her die out there.
Albatross to Base Command.
Transport complete.
Returning to forward operating base now.
Over.
The helicopter may return.
Hurry.
There's a lot of ammo down there.
Hannibal to Alpha Squad 5456.
We are taking this Jeep.
Over.
- Hannibal to Dover.
- Fire when ready.
Over.
All right, let's get these weapons.
Check the GPS.
Two Marines will follow you around back side.
Stay in radio contact, all right?
Take Galloz and Cruz.
You be safe out there, all right?
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
Hannibal to Mortar Section.
Fire for effect, HE.
Omar.
I need men to protect the satellite dish.
Only a few more minutes before we crack the encryption and jam the protocols.
You two, go with him!
Crush the infidels!
Hurry to the battle!
It's on deck right!
Get back!
Raven to Hannibal.
I got a Marine down.
Raven to Hannibal.
Repeat.
Over.
Damn it.
Raven to Hannibal.
I got a second Marine down.
Over.
Raven to Hannibal.
- Let's go!
Now!
- Yes, sir!
Come on, pull some piss!
Let's go!
Get this motherfucker off the ground!
Is there a problem?
I'm still working on it.
The satellite cannot read our signal yet.
We only have one chance at this, Sayid!
Don't fail!
Reporting to you live from the Convention Center, where numerous officials are arriving for today's conference under the protection of local police and anti-terrorism security forces.
Exam!
as a result of the successful signing of the peace accord.
Raven to Hannibal.
Do you copy?
Over.
Roger.
What's your status?
Over.
I have a visual on the dish.
The coordinates are 9-7-3-7-0-2-7-6-5-4.
Over.
Copy that, Raven!
Any signs of the Captain?
Over.
That's a negative, Hannibal.
Lieutenant Barnes to Base Command.
Be advised, target acquired.
Requesting HEPD on grid 97370267 54.
Over.
- Call Camp Navarro.
- Yes, sir.
We're heading north, awaiting final target position, over.
Copy that.
On your tail.
Max!
Max!
Max!
I never thought I'd see you again!
Yeah, I wasn't so sure myself.
Raven to Hannibal.
I found the Captain.
Over.
Copy that, Raven!
Get outta there now!
Air strike in one mike!
Over!
We gotta move.
Go!
Sir!
We got radio chatter about two vehicles running from the site!
Captain Randall and Miss Wallace reported to be in one of them!
Find them!
Take this.
Okay, I got them!
Nine o'clock!
Hold!
Hold!
Give me a hover!
He got RPG!
Hover!
God!
Dad?
That was a hell of a shot.
- Let's go get my little girl.
- Yes, sir!
My God!
Max.
And now, it is my pleasure and honor to present the United States Director of National Intelligence, John Fitzgerald.
Shit!
Hurry up with the bags.
That's all?
As part of our ongoing coverage, preparations continue... for the first meeting of the Asean Counter-Terrorism Council.
Given the successful coordination of recent operations against global terrorist threats, and because of the successful signing of the new regional peace accord,
Manila has been chosen as the location for the Council's inaugural meeting, coinciding with the Philippine's annual Independence Day celebrations.
Here we go!
Right knee, right knee, here we go!
Nice and hard!
Left knee!
Good.
Again!
Give it back!
Come on!
Come on!
One more!
Breathe, breathe.
Nice.
Tap!
Nice.
Double tap!
Good!
This time, double tap and elbow!
There you go.
Nice.
Good.
Keep your hands up.
Chin down.
Nice and tight.
Coming at you hard.
Ready?
Again.
- You feel that?
- Yes, sir!
I'm not kicking the pad, I'm trying to kick you.
You do that to me.
Let's go.
Okay, let me see a nice, easy push-kick.
- Nice!
- That good enough?
Yeah, that's good.
It feels good.
Do it again.
Come on, double jab!
Nice, nice.
Left elbow.
Relax.
Again.
Nice.
Captain Randall.
- Reyes.
- Your orders, sir.
All right, Reyes, get the men up and ready to roll in 30 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant Barnes, we are on the clock.
Gentlemen, listen up!
Lieutenant Barnes, you have the floor.
This is Sayid Nassif.
He's a trained engineer and a demolition expert, with a long history of terrorism across the globe.
He's fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, and recently formed a partnership with a radical terrorist faction group in Southern Mindanao.
Yesterday, he hijacked a truck owned by a local mining company hauling TNT to a test site.
Also, the government has reported a considerable amount of cesium-137 missing.
- Intel believes there is a connection.
- Is he trying to build a dirty bomb, sir?
We don't know for sure.
We do know he's transporting the material deeper into insurgent territory and collaborating with...
Abdul Malek.
Known insurgent and son of terrorist leader,
Omar Malek, the man responsible for the 2004 embassy bombings.
And the recent attacks in Kuala Lumpur..
Lights.
- Sir.
- Del Rio.
- Where's the intel coming from?
- An informant in Malek's ranks.
The insurgents are meeting in four hours at a factory warehouse in Zamboanga City.
Our mission is to secure the TNT and the cesium and eliminate the leadership.
Any questions?
We step off in 15 mikes.
Let's do this.
Captain.
A word with you before you leave?
Of course, sir.
We have reason to believe that Nassif is planning to set off a series of bombs in the metro Manila area.
One of those targets is this weekend's Counter-Terrorism Conference.
Won't the American DNI be present there, sir?
Yes, he will.
Along with a lot of other very important people in the same field.
Right now, we have no credible intelligence as to his plan of attack.
Consequently, it is imperative that you guys bring in both Nassif and Malek alive for questioning.
I don't want any loose cannons out there, you copy?
- Yes, sir.
- You inform the men.
Will do, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, General.
Abdul.
Sayid.
Peace be with you.
And also with you.
All is well.
The cesium is with my father at the camp.
Alpha to War Dog.
We have eyes on.
What's your position?
Over.
Sentry's in my sight.
Waiting for your orders, sir.
Over.
We need to leave as soon as possible.
Of course.
More men are on the way.
Take the shot, War Dog.
Remember, we need the leaders alive.
Over.
Don't be a fool!
Our enemy is hunting us down... at this very moment we speak.
Sleep tight, motherfucker.
- You have been betrayed!
- Me?
You must have been followed!
You have jeopardized the entire mission!
You, upstairs.
You, other side!
Hurry!
Abdul can fight for himself.
Move out!
Barnes, on me.
Clear!
Hicks, Del Rio, check upstairs!
McCray, on me!
I got a back door here, sir.
The intel is fucked!
Drive!
The gear's stuck!
McCray!
Disable the engine!
Make it work!
Grenade!
Sergeant, I told you we needed the leadership alive.
- Sir, I thought...
- No, you didn't think!
- You reacted!
- They had us pinned down, Captain!
I blew the toss.
Additional reports from local investigators suggest that the truck explosion at a warehouse in Zamboanga City earlier today was caused by a police operation against drug dealers that resulted in the death of innocent civilians.
Claims of this being...
Man, they got no clue what's going on out there.
They're about to get one.
I found this online.
One of those workers had a fucking video camera.
Shit, man.
Does the Captain know yet?
Back in '69, I nailed a VC counter-sniper at 1,000 yards.
Now, I can barely hit that goddamn piece of paper.
- What happened out there, Captain?
- Sir, I take full responsibility.
That's not what I asked you.
We needed the rebel leaders alive.
Sir, the intel was sparse, and the maps we were given were inaccurate, sir.
Right now, the foreign press has your face plastered all over TV and they're claiming that you killed innocent civilians.
It's only a matter of time before the insurgents come after you.
I'm pulling you out of the field, Captain.
Sir, with all due respect, isn't that a bit extreme?
It's all political bullshit, but I have no choice.
You're a target now.
Till further notice, you're off the mission.
Dismissed, Captain.
Hi.
Miss Wallace.
Hey, Dad.
Thank you for the invite.
Thanks for coming, kid.
Well, now that you're a contractor, I figured you could use the practice.
- I get too much practice.
- Safety's on, gun's hot.
Excellent.
Hey, I'm looking forward to Thursday.
I hope I like this one better than the others.
- I know you'll at least respect him.
- Really?
A real man?
Well, I'll be the judge of that.
Aziz, look.
It's Sayid.
Abdul is dead.
He fought bravely with his men to the last.
But somehow... you still live.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you as well.
It was a good death.
A death with honor.
And you?
Did you fight with honor?
You stand here before me without even a scratch!
Our fight together has just begun.
They killed my son like a filthy animal!
Abdul died for the cause and for Allah.
If you let his death distract you from our purpose then you disgrace him.
We need weapons and supplies to build explosives.
The General's daughter could be worth millions of dollars.
We will kidnap her.
But the man who killed my son will beg me for death... before I cut out his heart!
General Castillo, Secretary Rivera, thank you very much for being here today.
I must say, Miss Wallace, lam surprised to see a woman so young in charge of security for this conference.
I can assure you, Mr. Secretary,
Miss Wallace is at the absolute top of her profession.
You're very kind, General.
Whatever I have accomplished,
I owe it all to my training with Naval Intelligence.
How does this device protect the conference attendees?
Very simple, sir.
Danny.
The array sends interference signals over a broad range of the spectrum, identifying threats and jamming them.
No signal, no bombs.
What about a timed explosive?
Our intelligence agencies are on top of it.
They're much easier to detect.
Are you assuring me that the conference is totally safe?
You have G-Tech's word on that, sir.
I hope that would be enough.
Thank you, Miss Wallace.
Thank you.
- General.
- Mr. Secretary.
- General.
- Miss Wallace.
See you tomorrow.
Why, hello.
It's Captain Randall, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
And, Miss Wallace, you are looking mighty fine, as usual.
- May I offer you a ride?
- Of course.
- I think you should spend the night.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
- What time is it?
I'm not telling you.
I should go.
What?
It's not even dark yet.
Are you coming on Thursday?
I'm not sure yet.
There's a lot going on.
There's always a lot going on with you, Max.
- What are you doing?
Where are you going?
- I told you, I'm going home.
Don't get upset.
We've been dating for months.
Am I just another adventure for you, or do you want to get serious?
I thought we were serious.
Come here.
This is for you.
This is a key to your apartment.
Yeah.
Thank you.
But I do think we need to talk about this.
We just did, Max.
Take it or leave it.
Take it or leave it?
Jenna, there's a lot to our lives that make things complicated.
Life is complicated, so what?
What does that have to do with making a commitment to someone...
- ...you say you care about?
- I care about you!
It's just...
I'm not gonna wait around for you, Max.
I want a family and I want a life.
And I need to be open with my dad about us, so, if you're not there on Thursday for dinner with Dad,
I think it's time for us to be apart for a little while.
- There's the Cap.
- Excuse me.
Hey, Captain.
- Hey, guys.
How you doing?
- Doing great.
- All right.
- You're not leaving, are you?
Actually, I've got paperwork due in the morning.
Reyes, Del Rio, you guys...
- You have a round on me.
That's an order.
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Hey, Captain.
- Yeah.
You okay?
I'm just a little tired, Sergeant.
You have fun tonight.
- Hey, good to see you.
- You, too.
I really appreciate you doing this.
I hope it didn't ruin your day off.
No, not at all.
Just lock up, okay, or else Mr. Kotas will kill me.
- You got it.
- Here you go.
See you tomorrow.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
Tuck your shirt in.
Get him in!
Get him in!
Faster!
Remember, don't kill him.
Meet us at the camp.
- Max.
- Jenna, where are you?
- I'm at the gym, why?
- Get to the base now.
- Max, what...
- I don't have time.
Jenna?
Jenna!
Shit.
Miss Wallace.
The chloroform.
Jenna!
Hank.
Something terrible's happened.
You will pay $5 million, or we will cut off her head.
Your greed and your brutality will cost you this time.
You are like an animal to me.
I took you!
I own you!
Don't test me.
We will cut off her head.
I'll get the money.
I have good friends.
I own you!
Hank, you've been temporarily relieved of duty until this matter is resolved.
What are you talking about?
General Brown feels that your judgment is compromised.
He can't do that.
You'll get official notification within the hour.
Untie the woman.
Take off his hood.
Eduardo.
Turn around.
They're going to cut off our heads, aren't they?
Look at me, Eduardo.
We're not gonna die here.
I promise you.
Okay?
General Wallace.
- Did you get that GPS chip?
- Yes, sir.
The insurgents may try to take you again.
I buried your suspension.
According to official records, it never happened.
Thank you, sir.
Your new orders.
You find my little girl, Captain.
Whatever it takes, you bring her back.
I will, sir.
Sir.
At ease, Galloz.
Why don't you take five?
Aye, sir.
You're gonna tell me where Omar Malek is.
I am not telling you shit!
I think you will.
Have you ever met Major Santiago?
Now, I can't lay a hand on you, but I can damn well turn you over to the Major and we both know what he will do to you.
That is unless you tell me where Omar Malek is.
I swear...
I swear, I don't know.
Well, you better tell me who does.
His name is Ahas.
Spent about 15 years in the Filipino prison system.
Funnels money for terrorist groups in Mindanao.
Funds his operation trafficking drugs and women.
- You have his location in here?
- Yes, sir.
Good job, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
Are you okay, Private?
It's Reyes, sir.
He was his cousin.
Hey, Del Rio was like a brother to me.
It's time for some fucking payback!
- Nobody fucks with us without getting theirs!
- No mistakes out there, gentlemen.
This is not a blood feud, it's a mission.
All right, Marines, listen up!
We're heading 30 clicks down the Bolong River to detain an enemy facilitator for questioning.
This man right here.
Our mission is to uncover any information related to the whereabouts of Jenna Wallace.
We'll then move forward to secure the hostage, and eliminate the leadership within Omar Malek's ranks.
Sir, are we taking custody of the enemy facilitator?
That's a negative.
After we question him, we'll turn him over to Intel for further debriefing and move forward with our mission.
- Any more questions?
- No, sir.
Zodiac's moving out in 10 minutes.
Gentlemen, let's fucking do this!
Yeah.
Excitement continues to build for the Asean Counter-Terrorism Conference scheduled to begin this weekend.
Among the dignitaries arriving, is the Chief of Security from China who flew in early this morning.
The Spanish representative was eagerly awaited yesterday, but did not exit his limo to greet the crowds.
Security is a key concern at all events, but officials seemed confident.
Be precise with your measurements.
I'll take care of it.
I rechecked the seals.
No leaks.
What about the TNT?
Blended with the nitromethane.
Devised for maximum dispersal of the cesium.
But will there be enough?
Set off just one of these at the conference... dozens will die in an instant.
But within a week, thousands more will suffer and die slowly.
Sir!
Help us!
She isn't breathing right!
Something's very wrong!
Sir, she can't breathe and I don't know...
Turn around.
Keep your hands up.
Get up.
I said, get up!
Damn, that hurt.
Safety's off and there's a round chambered.
Your finger off the trigger guard till you're ready to fire.
- How do you know this stuff?
- I used to be a Marine.
You can do this, okay?
- Okay.
- Just don't shoot me in the back.
On your knees.
On your knees.
- Clear.
- Stack up.
Turn around!
Shut the fuck up and stay down!
I wanna see your hands on your heads!
- Status?
- Clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!
All clear!
You listen to me carefully!
I am not here for you or your stash!
I need some information about Omar Malek.
If you cooperate, this does not have to be hard.
- Yes, boss.
- "Yes, boss," what?
"Yes, boss" you gonna talk?
- Yes, boss.
- Where is Omar Malek?
- Yes, boss!
- Get your fucking face on the floor!
You wanna die?
You talk!
Or I'm gonna fucking kill you!
You wanna die right now, motherfucker?
I'll count you.
Go.
Okay, head for the truck.
Go.
- Any chance you can hot-wire a car?
- I'm from Manila.
Go for it.
Shit!
Shit!
- Sorry!
- Get out now!
Drop the weapon.
Drop your weapon.
Put down your weapon!
You!
Over there!
Drop your weapon!
Tie them up!
Hurry!
Tie them up!
- Two clicks in, is there a path?
- Yeah.
What do you have for me, Hicks?
Looks like it's about two clicks east of the Bolong River, sir.
Show me.
Here's the Bolong River, but there's a guard house.
- The camp is two clicks inland.
- Good job, Private.
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, listen up!
We're handing the enemy facilitator off to Intel in five and the Zodiac is leaving in 10.
Check your gear and be ready to move out.
Lieutenant.
You really think the Captain was gonna smoke that guy in there?
Of course not.
This is Captain Randall with Alpha Squad.
Come in.
I think he was.
He's not acting himself.
Focus on the mission, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Copy that.
Alpha Squad out.
Get his head on the block and bring me my sword!
Please don't do this!
I'll give you anything!
I barely know this woman!
I beg you!
My God!
I don't want to die!
For Allah!
My God!
Omar.
Omar.
We cannot acquire the ransom money if you kill her.
Be silent!
- I told you very simple.
- Omar.
If you disfigure her in any way we may lose millions of dollars.
That is enough!
Alpha to Hannibal.
- Any sign of the hostage?
Over.
- It's a negative.
Moving in position now.
Over.
- Alpha to Hannibal.
- Hannibal.
Over.
I've got eyes on the hostage.
She in a small shack at the southeast corner of the camp.
Contact Command.
Inform them I'm moving in.
Over.
They may only be delaying the payment.
We have to wait.
They have ten minutes... for the money to appear in the account.
Give them more time.
She is worth a fortune to us.
My son is dead because of men like her father.
If he won't pay me... then I will kill his child in turn.
Do it!
Start up the video!
Omar, be reasonable!
Ten minutes... then she dies.
The General's seriously considering that this mission will be a failure.
Sir!
General Castillo advises you not to enter the Control Room.
General Wallace, I don't think you should be here.
My daughter's out there.
You think I give a shit about procedure?
What's the sitrep?
Randall's team has found her.
This is Lieutenant Barnes of Task Force 5456.
Captain Randall has eyes on the hostage.
I repeat,
Captain Randall has eyes on the hostage.
Requesting permission to secure.
Over.
Get Randall in there.
Get Randall in there!
Hank, we have to be cautious.
Malek and Nassif are inside that compound!
She could get killed in the fire fight!
Sir, I just lost the connection.
My daughter dies in that jungle, I'll kill you.
Hannibal, what's the word from headquarters?
Over.
I've lost connection, sir.
Hannibal to Alpha.
Got eyes on Nassif and Malek.
Request permission to fire.
Over.
That's a negative, Hannibal.
Repeat, negative.
We cannot jeopardize the safety of the hostage.
Get the bird in the air now.
Over.
Copy that.
Calling Naval Command now.
General, Camp Navarro just received a live video link.
It's Miss Wallace, sir.
Play it.
Your time has run out.
We have been degraded long enough by the filthy West, defiling our home with their greed.
We stand for it no more.
No one is safe from our wrath.
Let this American be a symbol to the world.
They will bleed as we have bled.
Allah will grant us revenge.
The time has come.
The one true God will not abandon his followers!
Those who defy his will shall be slain!
By Allah!
Get the image back up.
I'm sorry, sir.
Lost the feed.
I knew you'd come get me.
I'm here.
Hannibal to Alpha.
Enemy on the move.
Do you copy?
Over.
Copy that, Hannibal.
Moving to contact now.
Over.
- Can you move?
All right.
- Yeah, I can move.
Let's go.
Stay close.
Alpha to Hannibal.
We have secured the hostage.
- Moving to rendezvous point.
- Copy that!
Call in close air support!
Dropping smoke!
Move out!
Call in air support!
Connection established, sir.
This is Lieutenant Barnes, Attack Force 5456.
Requesting HEPD on grid!
9-7-3-7-2-6-9-5-4!
McCray, moving out!
Get down!
Get down!
McCray, take the civilian!
Move out!
Let's go!
Move it!
Go, go, go!
Hannibal to Alpha.
Closing in on Charlie now.
Enemy in hot pursuit.
I repeat, enemy in hot pursuit.
Do you copy?
Over.
- Barnes, where are we?
- River's half a click north, sir.
All right.
You guys get the civilian to safety.
I'll cover your retreat.
Alone, sir?
I'll get up to the hills and meet you at rendezvous point Bravo.
If I don't show up, call the Task Force.
Max, what are you doing?
Come with me!
You listen to me.
If you don't go now, it'll all be for nothing.
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- You go.
- McCray, get her out of here.
- We gotta move out.
- Max, you mustn't.
- Go!
Don't worry, Miss Wallace.
Captain Randall's gonna be just fine.
- Find him.
- I will.
Move out!
Move, move!
Yo, we gotta move!
I'm going back for the Captain, sir.
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point.
- That was not the Captain's orders!
- Come on, Lieutenant!
He's all alone out there.
Okay.
Good luck.
Stay in radio contact.
- Let us know when you find him.
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant, I gave you an order!
- Civilian is secure, sir.
And I'm not letting you die out here alone.
Pressure on the wound!
Pressure on the wound!
Fuck!
- Fuck me!
- I'm all right.
You saved my ass, McCray.
You saved my ass.
God!
- Get me home, Captain.
- I'm gonna take you home, Sergeant.
- I'm taking you home.
- Fuck.
I'm gonna take you home, Sarge.
You're going home.
You're going home.
Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Hank.
We've got her.
- She all right?
- Bruised up some, but yeah, she's okay.
- Where is she?
- She's on her way.
It's okay.
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.
I thought I'd lost you, kid.
I thought I'd lost you.
- It's so good to see you.
- It's okay now, baby.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
Any word on Max?
No.
Not yet.
It's okay, baby.
Okay.
A luncheon was held with officials responsible for assuring the safety of dignitaries attending the Asean Counter Terrorism Conference.
A visit to the Presidential Gardens was in order prior to the formal luncheon.
Security officials were upbeat due to the fact that introductions of the many representatives attending the conference went off without a hitch earlier today.
The satellite dish has been moved and is ready to place.
The bombs are primed and in position.
I want as many casualties as possible.
But the priority is to kill government officials at the counter-terrorism conference... and especially the American Director of National Intelligence.
- He'll be blown away to pieces.
- How can you be sure?
There are bombs in the street... and a bomb in the conference hall and we'll detonate it from here while he gives his speech.
Remember to hide the dish from the drones.
We'll position it near the tree line for maximum range.
From the air it will be concealed.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, General.
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
- What can I do for you?
- I have some bad news.
When I was at the rebel camp, I saw a satellite dish with technology
I didn't think was possible to achieve here in the southern islands.
What exactly?
Components that could flood a system like G-Tech with enough alternating frequencies to bypass the jammers.
We'll have to find that satellite dish before it enters the Metro Manila area.
That's just it, sir.
If I'm right, they don't need to move it.
This system is powerful enough to set off a bomb from 1,000 miles away.
In his mercy, Allah brought you to me.
Justice will be done.
Cut him down!
Now!
Get back!
I'm going to kill him alone... with my bare hands!
Get up!
Get up.
I win!
Miss Wallace, you have any idea what I had to do to get you this mission?
- You won't regret it.
- Your father will be furious.
Are you sure you're up to this?
I'm the only one who qualified to do the job.
An air strike may or may not be possible when we locate the satellite dish.
If it needs to be disassembled, I'm the only one on base who can do it.
Do you have the GPS monitor locked on Captain Randall's new position?
Yes.
Listen, you're doing the right thing.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
I'll see you when I get back.
Jenna!
Jenna.
- Don't do this.
- I don't have a choice.
No one else can disable the dish, and Max risked his life for me.
- I can't leave him there alone.
- He's a Marine.
That's his job.
You don't owe him anything.
I have to stay focused right now.
I can't talk to you right now.
I've got a job, too.
I love you.
I'm not leaving without Captain Randall!
Neither are we.
Enemy fire!
Albatross to Base Command.
We got a chopper down.
What's the order?
Over!
Copy that, Albatross.
Proceed to rendezvous point Delta.
Over.
Okay, Marines, listen up!
We got a mission to complete!
Let's go get Captain Randall!
What's the status on the downed helicopter?
No survivors, sir.
Christ.
Is team Alpha on their way back to base camp?
Team Alpha is proceeding with the mission objective.
We're working on getting reinforcements now.
What the hell are you talking about?
You can't take out an enemy camp with a squad!
The objective is not to take out the camp.
The objective is to rescue Randall and destroy the satellite dish without killing civilians.
My daughter's on that ship, Lito.
She has to lead this team.
She is the most valuable person on that mission right now.
She's the only one who can shut down the dish if an air strike fails.
Look, Hank, I'm sorry.
General.
General!
General.
Hank.
What are you doing?
I'm not letting her die out there.
Albatross to Base Command.
Transport complete.
Returning to forward operating base now.
Over.
The helicopter may return.
Hurry.
There's a lot of ammo down there.
Hannibal to Alpha Squad 5456.
We are taking this Jeep.
Over.
- Hannibal to Dover.
- Fire when ready.
Over.
All right, let's get these weapons.
Check the GPS.
Two Marines will follow you around back side.
Stay in radio contact, all right?
Take Galloz and Cruz.
You be safe out there, all right?
- Good luck.
- Same to you.
Hannibal to Mortar Section.
Fire for effect, HE.
Omar.
I need men to protect the satellite dish.
Only a few more minutes before we crack the encryption and jam the protocols.
You two, go with him!
Crush the infidels!
Hurry to the battle!
It's on deck right!
Get back!
Raven to Hannibal.
I got a Marine down.
Raven to Hannibal.
Repeat.
Over.
Damn it.
Raven to Hannibal.
I got a second Marine down.
Over.
Raven to Hannibal.
- Let's go!
Now!
- Yes, sir!
Come on, pull some piss!
Let's go!
Get this motherfucker off the ground!
Is there a problem?
I'm still working on it.
The satellite cannot read our signal yet.
We only have one chance at this, Sayid!
Don't fail!
Reporting to you live from the Convention Center, where numerous officials are arriving for today's conference under the protection of local police and anti-terrorism security forces.
Exam!
As a result of the successful signing of the peace accord.
Raven to Hannibal.
Do you copy?
Over.
Roger.
What's your status?
Over.
I have a visual on the dish.
The coordinates are 9-7-3-7-0-2-7-6-5-4.
Over.
Copy that, Raven!
Any signs of the Captain?
Over.
That's a negative, Hannibal.
Lieutenant Barnes to Base Command.
Be advised, target acquired.
Requesting HEPD on grid 97370267... 54.
Over.
- Call Camp Navarro.
- Yes, sir.
We're heading north, awaiting final target position, over.
Copy that.
On your tail.
Max!
Max!
Max!
I never thought I'd see you again!
Yeah, I wasn't so sure myself.
Raven to Hannibal.
I found the Captain.
Over.
Copy that, Raven!
Get outta there now!
Air strike in one mike!
Over!
We gotta move.
Go!
Sir!
We got radio chatter about two vehicles running from the site!
Captain Randall and Miss Wallace reported to be in one of them!
Find them!
Take this.
Okay, I got them!
Nine o'clock!
Hold!
Hold!
Give me a hover!
He got RPG!
Hover!
God!
Dad?
That was a hell of a shot.
- Let's go get my little girl.
- Yes, sir!
My God!
Max.
And now, it is my pleasure and honor to present the United States Director of National Intelligence, John Fitzgerald.
Shit!
Hurry up with the bags.
That's all?
As part of our ongoing coverage, preparations continue for the first meeting of the Asean Counter-Terrorism Council.
Given the successful coordination of recent operations against global terrorist threats, and because of the successful signing of the new regional peace accord,
Manila has been chosen as the location for the Council's inaugural meeting, coinciding with the Philippine's annual Independence Day celebrations.
Here we go!
Right knee, right knee, here we go!
Nice and hard!
Left knee!
Good.
Again!
Give it back!
Come on!
Come on!
One more!
Breathe, breathe.
Nice.
Tap!
Nice.
Double tap!
Good!
This time, double tap and elbow!
There you go.
Nice.
Good.
Keep your hands up.
Chin down.
Nice and tight.
Coming at you hard.
Ready?
Again.
- You feel that?
- Yes, sir!
I'm not kicking the pad, I'm trying to kick you.
You do that to me.
Let's go.
Okay, let me see a nice, easy push-kick.
- Nice!
- That good enough?
Yeah, that's good.
It feels good.
Do it again.
Come on, double jab!
Nice, nice.
Left elbow.
Relax.
Again.
Nice.
Captain Randall.
- Reyes.
- Your orders, sir.
All right, Reyes, get the men up and ready to roll in 30 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant Barnes, we are on the clock.
Gentlemen, listen up!
Lieutenant Barnes, you have the floor.
This is Sayid Nassif.
He's a trained engineer and a demolition expert, with a long history of terrorism across the globe.
He's fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, and recently formed a partnership with a radical terrorist faction group in Southern Mindanao.
Yesterday, he hijacked a truck owned by a local mining company hauling TNT to a test site.
Also, the government has reported a considerable amount of cesium-137 missing.
- Intel believes there is a connection.
- Is he trying to build a dirty bomb, sir?
We don't know for sure.
We do know he's transporting the material deeper into insurgent territory and collaborating with...
Abdul Malek.
Known insurgent and son of terrorist leader,
Omar Malek, the man responsible for the 2004 embassy bombings.
And the recent attacks in Kuala Lumpur..
Lights.
- Sir.
- Del Rio.
- Where's the intel coming from?
- An informant in Malek's ranks.
The insurgents are meeting in four hours at a factory warehouse in Zamboanga City.
Our mission is to secure the TNT and the cesium and eliminate the leadership.
Any questions?
We step off in 15 mikes.
Let's do this.
Captain.
A word with you before you leave?
Of course, sir.
We have reason to believe that Nassif is planning to set off a series of bombs in the metro Manila area.
One of those targets is this weekend's Counter-Terrorism Conference.
Won't the American DNI be present there, sir?
Yes, he will.
Along with a lot of other very important people in the same field.
Right now, we have no credible intelligence as to his plan of attack.
Consequently, it is imperative that you guys bring in both Nassif and Malek alive for questioning.
I don't want any loose cannons out there, you copy?
- Yes, sir.
- You inform the men.
Will do, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, General.
Abdul.
Sayid.
Peace be with you.
And also with you.
All is well.
The cesium is with my father at the camp.
Alpha to War Dog.
We have eyes on.
What's your position?
Over.
Sentry's in my sight.
Waiting for your orders, sir.
Over.
We need to leave as soon as possible.
Of course.
More men are on the way.
Take the shot, War Dog.
Remember, we need the leaders alive.
Over.
Don't be a fool!
Our enemy is hunting us down at this very moment we speak.
Sleep tight, motherfucker.
- You have been betrayed!
- Me?
You must have been followed!
You have jeopardized the entire mission!
You, upstairs
You, other side!
Hurry!
Abdul can fight for himself.
Move out!
Barnes, on me.
Clear!
Hicks, Del Rio, check upstairs!
McCray, on me!
I got a back door here, sir.
The intel is fucked!
Drive!
The gear's stuck!
McCray!
Disable the engine!
Make it work!
Grenade!
Sergeant, I told you we needed the leadership alive.
- Sir, I thought...
- No, you didn't think!
- You reacted!
- They had us pinned down, Captain!
I blew the toss.
Additional reports from local investigators suggest that the truck explosion at a warehouse in Zamboanga City earlier today was caused by a police operation against drug dealers that resulted in the death of innocent civilians.
Claims of this being...
Man, they got no clue what's going on out there.
They're about to get one.
I found this online.
One of those workers had a fucking video camera.
Shit, man.
Does the Captain know yet?
Back in '69, I nailed a VC counter-sniper at 1,000 yards.
Now, I can barely hit that goddamn piece of paper.
- What happened out there, Captain?
- Sir, I take full responsibility.
That's not what I asked you.
We needed the rebel leaders alive.
Sir, the intel was sparse, and the maps we were given were inaccurate, sir.
Right now, the foreign press has your face plastered all over TV and they're claiming that you killed innocent civilians.
It's only a matter of time before the insurgents come after you.
I'm pulling you out of the field, Captain.
Sir, with all due respect, isn't that a bit extreme?
It's all political bullshit, but I have no choice.
You're a target now.
Till further notice, you're off the mission.
Dismissed, Captain.
Hi.
Miss Wallace.
Hey, Dad.
Thank you for the invite.
Thanks for coming, kid.
Well, now that you're a contractor, I figured you could use the practice.
- I get too much practice.
- Safety's on, gun's hot.
Excellent.
Hey, I'm looking forward to Thursday.
I hope I like this one better than the others.
- I know you'll at least respect him.
- Really?
A real man?
Well, I'll be the judge of that.
Aziz, look.
It's Sayid.
Abdul is dead.
He fought bravely with his men to the last.
But somehow you still live.
Peace be upon you.
And upon you as well.
It was a good death.
A death with honor.
And you?
Did you fight with honor?
You stand here before me without even a scratch!
Our fight together has just begun.
They killed my son like a filthy animal!
Abdul died for the cause and for Allah.
If you let his death distract you from our purpose then you disgrace him.
We need weapons and supplies to build explosives.
The General's daughter could be worth millions of dollars.
We will kidnap her.
But the man who killed my son will beg me for death before I cut out his heart!
General Castillo, Secretary Rivera, thank you very much for being here today.
I must say, Miss Wallace, lam surprised to see a woman so young in charge of security for this conference.
I can assure you, Mr. Secretary,
Miss Wallace is at the absolute top of her profession.
You're very kind, General.
Whatever I have accomplished,
I owe it all to my training with Naval Intelligence.
How does this device protect the conference attendees?
Very simple, sir.
Danny.
The array sends interference signals over a broad range of the spectrum, identifying threats and jamming them.
No signal, no bombs.
What about a timed explosive?
Our intelligence agencies are on top of it.
They're much easier to detect.
Are you assuring me that the conference is totally safe?
You have G-Tech's word on that, sir.
I hope that would be enough.
Thank you, Miss Wallace.
Thank you.
- General.
- Mr. Secretary.
- General.
- Miss Wallace.
See you tomorrow.
Why, hello.
It's Captain Randall, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
And, Miss Wallace, you are looking mighty fine, as usual.
- May I offer you a ride?
- Of course.
- I think you should spend the night.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
- What time is it?
I'm not telling you.
I should go.
What?
It's not even dark yet.
Are you coming on Thursday?
I'm not sure yet.
There's a lot going on.
There's always a lot going on with you, Max.
- What are you doing?
Where are you going?
- I told you, I'm going home.
Don't get upset.
We've been dating for months.
Am I just another adventure for you, or do you want to get serious?
I thought we were serious.
Come here.
This is for you.
This is a key to your apartment.
Yeah.
Thank you.
But I do think we need to talk about this.
We just did, Max.
Take it or leave it.
Take it or leave it?
Jenna, there's a lot to our lives that make things complicated.
Life is complicated, so what?
What does that have to do with making a commitment to someone...
- ...you say you care about?
- I care about you!
It's just...
I'm not gonna wait around for you, Max.
I want a family and I want a life.
And I need to be open with my dad about us, so, if you're not there on Thursday for dinner with Dad,
I think it's time for us to be apart for a little while.
- There's the Cap.
- Excuse me.
Hey, Captain.
- Hey, guys.
How you doing?
- Doing great.
- All right.
- You're not leaving, are you?
Actually, I've got paperwork due in the morning.
Reyes, Del Rio, you guys...
- You have a round on me.
That's an order.
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Hey, Captain.
- Yeah.
You okay?
I'm just a little tired, Sergeant.
You have fun tonight.
- Hey, good to see you.
- You, too.
I really appreciate you doing this.
I hope it didn't ruin your day off.
No, not at all.
Just lock up, okay, or else Mr. Kotas will kill me.
- You got it.
- Here you go.
See you tomorrow.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
Tuck your shirt in.
Get him in!
Get him in!
Faster!
Remember, don't kill him.
Meet us at the camp.
- Max.
- Jenna, where are you?
- I'm at the gym, why?
- Get to the base now.
- Max, what...
- I don't have time.
Jenna?
Jenna!
Shit.
Miss Wallace.
The chloroform.
Jenna!
Hank.
Something terrible's happened.
You will pay $5 million, or we will cut off her head.
Your greed and your brutality will cost you this time.
You are like an animal to me.
I took you!
I own you!
Don't test me.
We will cut off her head.
I'll get the money.
I have good friends.
I own you!
Hank, you've been temporarily relieved of duty until this matter is resolved.
What are you talking about?
General Brown feels that your judgment is compromised.
He can't do that.
You'll get official notification within the hour.
Untie the woman.
Take off his hood.
Eduardo.
Turn around.
They're going to cut off our heads, aren't they?
Look at me, Eduardo.
We're not gonna die here.
I promise you.
Okay?
General Wallace.
- Did you get that GPS chip?
- Yes, sir.
The insurgents may try to take you again.
I buried your suspension.
According to official records, it never happened.
Thank you, sir.
Your new orders.
You find my little girl, Captain.
Whatever it takes, you bring her back.
I will, sir.
Sir.
At ease, Galloz.
Why don't you take five?
Aye, sir.
You're gonna tell me where Omar Malek is.
I am not telling you shit!
I think you will.
Have you ever met Major Santiago?
Now, I can't lay a hand on you, but I can damn well turn you over to the Major and we both know what he will do to you.
That is unless you tell me where Omar Malek is.
I swear...
I swear, I don't know.
Well, you better tell me who does.
His name is Ahas.
Spent about 15 years in the Filipino prison system.
Funnels money for terrorist groups in Mindanao.
Funds his operation trafficking drugs and women.
- You have his location in here?
- Yes, sir.
Good job, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
Are you okay, Private?
It's Reyes, sir.
He was his cousin.
Hey, Del Rio was like a brother to me.
It's time for some fucking payback!
- Nobody fucks with us without getting theirs!
- No mistakes out there, gentlemen.
This is not a blood feud, it's a mission.
All right, Marines, listen up!
We're heading 30 clicks down the Bolong River to detain an enemy facilitator for questioning.
This man right here.
Our mission is to uncover any information related to the whereabouts of Jenna Wallace.
We'll then move forward to secure the hostage, and eliminate the leadership within Omar Malek's ranks.
Sir, are we taking custody of the enemy facilitator?
That's a negative.
After we question him, we'll turn him over to Intel for further debriefing and move forward with our mission.
- Any more questions?
- No, sir.
Zodiac's moving out in 10 minutes.
Gentlemen, let's fucking do this!
Yeah.
Excitement continues to build for the Asean Counter-Terrorism Conference scheduled to begin this weekend.
Among the dignitaries arriving, is the Chief of Security from China who flew in early this morning.
The Spanish representative was eagerly awaited yesterday, but did not exit his limo to greet the crowds.
Security is a key concern at all events, but officials seemed confident.
Be precise with your measurements.
I'll take care of it.
I rechecked the seals.
No leaks.
What about the TNT?
Blended with the nitromethane.
Devised for maximum dispersal of the cesium.
But will there be enough?
Set off just one of these at the conference dozens will die in an instant.
But within a week, thousands more will suffer and die slowly.
Sir!
Help us!
She isn't breathing right!
Something's very wrong!
Sir, she can't breathe and I don't know...
Turn around.
Keep your hands up.
Get up.
I said, get up!
Damn, that hurt.
Safety's off and there's a round chambered.
Your finger off the trigger guard till you're ready to fire.
- How do you know this stuff?
- I used to be a Marine.
- You can do this, okay?
- Okay.
Just don't shoot me in the back.
On your knees.
On your knees.
- Clear.
- Stack up.
Turn around!
Shut the fuck up and stay down!
I wanna see your hands on your heads!
- Status?
- Clear!
- Clear!
- Clear!
All clear!
You listen to me carefully!
I am not here for you or your stash!
I need some information about Omar Malek.
If you cooperate, this does not have to be hard.
- Yes, boss.
-"Yes, boss," what?
"Yes, boss" you gonna talk?
- Yes, boss.
- Where is Omar Malek?
- Yes, boss!
- Get your fucking face on the floor!
You wanna die?
You talk!
Or I'm gonna fucking kill you!
You wanna die right now, motherfucker?
I'll count you.
Go.
Okay, head for the truck.
Go.
- Any chance you can hot-wire a car?
- I'm from Manila.
Go for it.
Shit!
Shit!
- Sorry!
- Get out now!
Drop the weapon.
Drop your weapon.
Put down your weapon!
You!
Over there!
Drop your weapon!
Tie them up!
Hurry!
Tie them up!
- Two clicks in, is there a path?
- Yeah.
What do you have for me, Hicks?
Looks like it's about two clicks east of the Bolong River, sir.
Show me.
Here's the Bolong River, but there's a guard house.
- The camp is two clicks inland.
- Good job, Private.
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, listen up!
We're handing the enemy facilitator off to Intel in five and the Zodiac is leaving in 10.
Check your gear and be ready to move out.
Lieutenant.
You really think the Captain was gonna smoke that guy in there?
Of course not.
This is Captain Randall with Alpha Squad.
Come in.
I think he was.
He's not acting himself.
Focus on the mission, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Copy that.
Alpha Squad out.
Get his head on the block and bring me my sword!
Please don't do this!
I'll give you anything!
I barely know this woman!
I beg you!
My God!
I don't want to die!
For Allah!
My God!
Omar.
Omar.
We cannot acquire the ransom money if you kill her.
Be silent!
- I told you very simple.
- Omar.
If you disfigure her in any way...
We may lose millions of dollars.
That is enough!
Alpha to Hannibal.
- Any sign of the hostage?
Over.
- It's a negative.
Moving in position now.
Over.
- Alpha to Hannibal.
- Hannibal.
Over.
I've got eyes on the hostage.
She in a small shack at the southeast corner of the camp.
Contact Command.
Inform them I'm moving in.
Over.
They may only be delaying the payment.
We have to wait.
They have ten minutes for the money to appear in the account.
Give them more time.
She is worth a fortune to us.
My son is dead because of men like her father.
If he won't pay me then I will kill his child in turn.
Do it!
Start up the video!
Omar, be reasonable!
Ten minutes then she dies.
The General's seriously considering that this mission will be a failure.
Sir!
General Castillo advises you not to enter the Control Room.
General Wallace, I don't think you should be here.
My daughter's out there.
You think I give a shit about procedure?
What's the sitrep?
Randall's team has found her.
This is Lieutenant Barnes of Task Force 5456.
Captain Randall has eyes on the hostage.
I repeat, Captain Randall has eyes on the hostage.
Requesting permission to secure.
Over.
Get Randall in there.
Get Randall in there!
Hank, we have to be cautious.
Malek and Nassif are inside that compound!
She could get killed in the fire fight!
Sir, I just lost the connection.
My daughter dies in that jungle, I'll kill you.
Hannibal, what's the word from headquarters?
Over.
I've lost connection, sir.
Hannibal to Alpha.
Got eyes on Nassif and Malek.
Request permission to fire.
Over.
That's a negative, Hannibal.
Repeat, negative.
We cannot jeopardize the safety of the hostage.
Get the bird in the air now.
Over.
Copy that.
Calling Naval Command now.
General, Camp Navarro just received a live video link.
It's Miss Wallace, sir.
Play it.
Your time has run out.
We have been degraded long enough by the filthy West, defiling our home with their greed.
We stand for it no more.
No one is safe from our wrath.
Let this American be a symbol to the world.
They will bleed as we have bled.
Allah will grant us revenge.
The time has come.
The one true God will not abandon his followers!
Those who defy his will shall be slain!
By Allah!
Get the image back up.
I'm sorry, sir.
Lost the feed.
I knew you'd come get me.
I'm here.
Hannibal to Alpha.
Enemy on the move.
Do you copy?
Over.
Copy that, Hannibal.
Moving to contact now.
Over.
- Can you move?
All right.
- Yeah, I can move.
Let's go.
Stay close.
Alpha to Hannibal.
We have secured the hostage.
- Moving to rendezvous point.
- Copy that!
Call in close air support!
Dropping smoke!
Move out!
Call in air support!
Connection established, sir.
This is Lieutenant Barnes, Attack Force 5456.
Requesting HEPD on grid!
9-7-3-7-2-6-9-5-4!
McCray, moving out!
Get down!
Get down!
McCray, take the civilian!
Move out!
Let's go!
Move it!
Go, go, go!
Hannibal to Alpha.
Closing in on Charlie now.
Enemy in hot pursuit.
I repeat, enemy in hot pursuit.
Do you copy?
Over.
- Barnes, where are we?
- River's half a click north, sir.
All right.
You guys get the civilian to safety.
I'll cover your retreat.
Alone, sir?
I'll get up to the hills and meet you at rendezvous point Bravo.
If I don't show up, call the Task Force.
Max, what are you doing?
Come with me!
You listen to me.
If you don't go now, it'll all be for nothing.
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- You go.
- McCray, get her out of here.
- We gotta move out.
- Max, you mustn't.
- Go!
Don't worry, Miss Wallace.
Captain Randall's gonna be just fine.
- Find him.
- I will.
Move out!
Move, move!
Yo, we gotta move!
I'm going back for the Captain, sir.
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point.
- That was not the Captain's orders!
- Come on, Lieutenant!
He's all alone out there.
Okay.
Good luck.
Stay in radio contact.
- Let us know when you find him.
- Yes, sir.
- Sergeant, I gave you an order!
- Civilian is secure, sir.
And I'm not letting you die out here alone.
Pressure on the wound!
Pressure on the wound!
Fuck!
- Fuck me!
- I'm all right.
You saved my ass, McCray.
You saved my ass.
God!
- Get me home, Captain.
- I'm gonna take you home, Sergeant.
- I'm taking you home.
- Fuck.
I'm gonna take you home, Sarge.
You're going home.
You're going home.
Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Hank.
We've got her.
- She all right?
- Bruised up some, but yeah, she's okay.
- Where is she?
- She's on her way.
It's okay.
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.
I thought I'd lost you, kid.
I thought I'd lost you.
- It's so good to see you.
- It's okay now, baby.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Okay.
Any word on Max?
No.
Not yet.
It's okay, baby.
Okay.
A luncheon was held with officials responsible for assuring the safety of dignitaries attending the Asean Counter
- Terrorism Conference.
A visit to the Presidential Gardens was in order prior to the formal luncheon.
Security officials were upbeat due to the fact that introductions of the many representatives attending the conference went off without a hitch earlier today.
The satellite dish has been moved and is ready to place.
The bombs are primed and in position.
I want as many casualties as possible.
But the priority is to kill government officials at the counter-terrorism conference... and especially the American Director of National Intelligence.
He'll be blown away to pieces.
How can you be sure?
There are bombs in the street and a bomb in the conference hall and we'll detonate it from here while he gives his speech.
Remember to hide the dish from the drones.
We'll position it near the tree line for maximum range.
From the air it will be concealed.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, General.
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
- What can I do for you?
- I have some bad news.
When I was at the rebel camp, I saw a satellite dish with technology
I didn't think was possible to achieve here in the southern islands.
What exactly?
Components that could flood a system like G-Tech with enough alternating frequencies to bypass the jammers.
We'll have to find that satellite dish before it enters the Metro Manila area.
That's just it, sir.
If I'm right, they don't need to move it.
This system is powerful enough to set off a bomb from 1,000 miles away.
In his mercy, Allah brought you to me.
Justice will be done.
Cut him down!
Now!
Get back!
I'm going to kill him alone... with my bare hands!
Get up!
Get up.
I win!
Miss Wallace, you have any idea what I had to do to get you this mission?
- You won't regret it.
- Your father will be furious.
- Are you sure you're up to this?
- I'm the only one who qualified to do the job.
An air strike may or may not be possible when we locate the satellite dish.
If it needs to be disassembled, I'm the only one on base who can do it.
Do you have the GPS monitor locked on Captain Randall's new position?
Yes.
Listen, you're doing the right thing.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
I'll see you when I get back.
Jenna!
Jenna.
- Don't do this.
- I don't have a choice.
No one else can disable the dish, and Max risked his life for me.
- I can't leave him there alone.
- He's a Marine.
That's his job.
You don't owe him anything.
I have to stay focused right now.
I can't talk to you right now.
I've got a job, too.
I love you.
I'm not leaving without Captain Randall!
Neither are we.
Enemy fire!

Okay, Marines, listen up!
We got a mission to complete!
Let's go get Captain Randall!
What's the status on the downed helicopter?
No survivors, sir.
Christ.
Is team Alpha on their way back to base camp?
Team Alpha is proceeding with the mission objective.
We're working on getting reinforcements now.
What the hell are you talking about?
You can't take out an enemy camp with a squad!
The objective is not to take out the camp.
The objective is to rescue Randall and destroy the satellite dish without killing civilians.
My daughter's on that ship, Lito.
She has to lead this team.
She is the most valuable person on that mission right now.
She's the only one who can shut down the dish if an air strike fails.
Look, Hank, I'm sorry.

Let's go!
Get this motherfucker off the ground!
Is there a problem?
I'm still working on it.
The satellite cannot read our signal yet.
We only have one chance at this, Sayid!
Don't fail!

This is Sayid Nassif.

We have reason to believe that Nassif is planning to set off a series of bombs In I the metro Manila area.
One of those targets is this weekend's I
Counter-Terrorism Conference.
Won't the Amerln DNI be present there, sir?
I
Yes, he will.
Along with a lot of other very important people in the same field.
Right now, we have I no credible intelligence as to his plan of attack.

You ran out into the back garden.
You were crying.
You heard a noise in the skies above you.
The sound of bells, sleigh bells, and that's when you saw me.
You knew it wasn't a shooting star.
That's just what your mother told you.
But you had proof.
You found a gift in the garden, a gift that I had left for you.
What was it?
Do you remember?
Why don't you tell me?
It was the most popular gift of that year.
A Rubik's cube.
You still have it, don't you?
Not because of me.
Oh, no.
No, you kept it because that was the last family Christmas you ever had.
How do you know that?
Because he's Santa.
Deep in your heart, you know who I am.
Deep in my heart, you're a nutbag.
(CHUCKLING)
The reindeer have been moved to a private area in Richmond Park.
Go there.
Seek out Dasher.
He knows what to do.
- Dasher speaks?
- He communicates.
Right, that's it, I've had enough of this.
We haven't seen each other in a very long time, OK?
And I wouldn't ask this if it wasn't the most important job in the world.
- Come on, we're going.
- We had a deal.
What, you wanna spend our day looking for a talking reindeer?
- Yes.
- OK, then, that's what we'll do.
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
- Come on.
- One more thing.
How do I survive in this place?
Erm, stop pretending to be Father Christmas.
Steve.
Go and see the barber.
- Er, I can't change my look.
- For advice.
Tell him I sent you.
(BUZZING)
Excuse me.
Are you the barber?
- No, I'm the vet.
- They keep animals here?
Yeah, they keep all sorts of animals in here.
Do they keep reindeer?
- Are you trying to be funny?
- No, I'm trying to find the barber.
It's pretty obvious I'm the barber, isn't it?
Steve Anderson said you'd be able to help me.
- You know Steve?
- I know Steve very well.
- Do one.
- Eh?
Do one.
Any friend of Steve's a friend of mine.
Oh, that's great news!
A friend is exactly what I need.
What can I do for you?
Well, it's rather a long story.
Take a seat, pops.
The one thing we've got in here is time.
Well, I was born in Lapland a long time ago.
Neighbourhood I grew up in was a small town in the Laughing Valley of Hohaho.
Although my childhood was happy, one day an old woodcutter told me about all the poverty in the world.
And I was so shocked that I went straight to Elf City.
Now, the elves are wonderful toy makers, as you know.
So I went there with a mission, that on Christmas morning, from that day forth, every child would get a toy.
I know what you're thinking.
Where do the reindeer come in?
STEVE:
Right, so there's six reindeer, and they all look like, er, reindeer.
None of them appear to be talking, but...
No, hang on, one second.
Oh, no, he's just eating grass.
Why are you acting like an idiot, Steve?
You know, it wouldn't hurt you to call me Dad once in a while, cos, like it or lump it, that's what I am.
Lump it.
You're not going over the fence.
Get off the fence.
Oi, you're not climbing over the fence.
Right, that's it, mister.
Me and you are now officially no longer friends.
So, as we speak, Steve and his son Tom are rescuing my head reindeer, Dasher, who will then lead them to my new magic sleigh.
They will then be able to fly in and spring me from prison.
Well, me first advice is don't tell anyone about this.
- Yeah, not in here.
- OK.
In fact, I think it might be better if we create a whole new back story for you.
You know, one where you won't end up in a psychiatric unit.
- You don't think they'll believe me?
- I'm positive they won't.
So instead of "Santa Claus", let's pretend your name's,
I don't know, something like Mad Jimmy Claws.
You're a veteran safe cracker, bank robber, all-round bad guy.
Mad Jimmy Claws?
Yeah.
Do you like it?
- I think it's horrible.
- It's supposed to be.
Show me your gangster face.
- My what?
- Your mean face.
Hmm?
Now, if you're gonna be Mad Jimmy Claws, you've gotta be...
- Mad.
- No, not mad crazy.
Just mean.
Mean.
- No, mean.
- Mean.
Don't ever do that again.
OK, so, Dasher, if you are here, your boss wants us to spring him from prison, and he says that you would know what to do.
- Nothing.
- He might be shy.
Or he might be a reindeer that doesn't speak.
Dasher, we're your friends.
We're not going to hurt you.
If you're here, just show yourself.
(REINDEER GRUNTING)
(REINDEER FARTS)
(VERY LONG FART)
Santa didn't say he spoke.
He said he communicated.
That's not a communication.
That's a fart.
Hello, reindeer.
If any of you are trying to speak, fart now.
(FARTING)
Oh, come on.
If one of you is Dasher, fart now.
Dasher's not here.
- What, that's your proof?
- No.
That's my proof.
Santa has seven reindeer.
(REINDEER FARTING)
All right, so what does that mean?
(SIREN WAILING)
No, no, no, no.
Quick, run!
This is Sierra 15.
We're in pursuit of a man and child on suspicion of...
- Why are we chasing them?
- Suspected reindeer rustling.
(ENGINE FAILS TO START)
- Oh, come on.
Come on, come on.
- This van's rubbish.
She's a bit rusty.
But that's what happens when you've been locked up for two years.
- Come on!
- Hurry.
(TYRES SCREECH)
(SIREN WAILING)
This is bad, Tom.
This is really, really bad.
If I get caught, I'm going straight back to...
Oh, my!
Dasher.
It's him.
Do you think he can fly us out of here?
No, I do not think he can fly us out of here.
- Dasher, can you fly?
- (DASHER FARTS)
Will you stop asking him questions, please?
- It really is him, isn't it?
- Well, it is a reindeer, yes,
I will give you that.
I'm really sorry, I think we should get back onto the road.
If we stay on the grass, we're going to be blocked in.
- Gatehouse, this is Finkerton.
- MAN ON POLICE RADIO:
Who?
- Sergeant Finkerton.
- Finker what?
Finkerton!
Thames Valley Police.
We have some traffic coming your way.
Be sure to stop it.
Over!
- What are we gonna do now?
- Well, we either stop or we don't.
Don't!
That was brilliant!
Yes, but definitely not within the terms of my parole.
(SIREN WAILING)
Not tough enough?
Well, you're walking like you need the toilet.
All right.
- How about this?
- Yeah, come on.
- Fractionally better.
- Oh, good.
Now, remember, anyone stares at you, you stare right back at them, yeah?
Don't be afraid, but don't be stupid either.
And if they won't budge, tell 'em to get out of your face.
Get out of your face!
No, not get out of their face.
Get out of your face.
Get out of their face.
Get out of your face.
No.
Get out of me face.
- Get out of me face.
- That's it, yeah.
- Yeah, OK.
- Get out of me face.
- Get out of me face.
- Get out of me face.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
- Very good.
Right, in the chair.
- Not...
- No, no, no, don't worry.
I'm not gonna cut your beard.
Just a few finishing touches.
- What's he doing?
- Stop the van.
- Why?
- Stop the van.
- I think he wants to get out.
- I wanna know how he got in.
- TOM:
Dad, hurry!
- STEVE:
Wait up.
Dasher!
Dasher?
Dasher!
If that really is your name.
Dasher!

Why?
What did Mum say about me?
That you'd build me up with promises and then let me down.
That's a very nasty thing to say, and it's not true.
Well, no, actually, it is true.
I am immensely unreliable and I always let people down, which is precisely the reason why Santa would never choose me for this so-called mission.
Yeah?
Well, he did.
So he must have had a good reason.
All I wanted today was a chance to be a proper dad.
Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting to see you?
Two years, one month and three days.

With you dressed like that, we can knock 'em out for a bull's-eye a piece.
Your name's Roger Shaw.
You grew up in Bethnal Green.
When you were nine, you wrote to me and asked for a bike.
I brought you one.
It was silver.
Two days later, your father sold it to make ends meet.
Your name is Sam Peters.
You were born in Torquay, Devon.
When you were six, you wrote to me and asked for a painting set.
I brought you one and you used it every day.
Until your friends told you it was girly and you threw it in the bin.
Your name is Marlon Baxter.
When you were seven, your mother left you and your father and you wrote to me asking for her to come home.
Well, that's not the sort of wish I can grant.
But she's alive and living in Leeds in Yorkshire, and not a single day goes by when she doesn't regret what she did.
Should I carry on?
No.
I'm Santa, Father Christmas, call me what you want.
With the help of two friends, I intend to escape from here tonight so that I can deliver presents to all the children in the world.
Wait.
What friends?
Steve Anderson.
You may know him.
And his son Tom.
You put the fate of Christmas in the hands of that monkey?
Steve is very reliable.

WOMAN:
Where do you think he's heading?
We're currently looking into whether he has any friends or family in Suffolk.
Would you like my take?
Well, I can't help but feel we're gonna get it.
I just received a phone call from Lambeth Prison.
Steve broke his parole conditions and paid a visit to this man.
I did a little research.
This picture is 20 years old.
A friend of mine from the Yard just sent it over.
He looks the same age.
His name is Harry Mitchell.
He was arrested Christmas '92 for trying to climb down someone's chimney.
Well, he's mad, obsessed with Christmas.
So what?
He escaped out of the police vehicle on the way from court.
They still don't know how he did it.
It would appear he's something of an escape artist.
I just rang the governor at Lambeth to let him know.
- What's going on?
- Come on, Harry,
- you're coming with us.
- We're having a Christmas party.
- Where are you taking me?
- Back to your cell.
But there are children waiting to see me.
We're just running a few checks, Harry.
That's all.
Harry?
Who's Harry?
It's the same as the picture in the book.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
It's only got three sides!
"Last collection 24th of December.
"No collection after 12:00 midnight."
What is this?
- (RINGING TONE)
- Hello?
Hello, mate.
Can I speak to Santa, please?
What, you mean Harry Mitchell?
What are you talking about?
Father Christmas, Santa Claus, whatever you wanna call him.
His real name's Mitchell, Harry Mitchell.
- Go on.
- He's got previous.
Arrested in Bradford on a burglary charge.
He's some sort of scam man.
They've got him on temporary lockdown in his cell while they run checks.
Give up on this joker, lad, before you wind up back in here.
Take care.
What's happened?
He's not Santa.
- Yes, he is.
- He's not.
But what about the sleigh?
And Dasher?
And all the stuff he knew about you?
I don't know.
Some sort of weird trick.
- It's not, Dad.
- Look, look around you, Son.
It's not Santa's grotto.
It's some sort of a water tower.
What about the book?
What about it?
I don't know.
Maybe we're in the wrong place.
Maybe there's another tower.
OK, listen to me, Tom.
I'm in a great deal of trouble, all right?
The sooner we call off this whole search thing, the better it'll be for me.
(EXHALES)
Thank you.
Lambeth Prison have Harry Mitchell in his cell.
- They obviously trust your instincts.
- Well, I'm glad somebody does.
Well, maybe I do owe you an apology. (CHUCKLES)

It was Dasher.
I mean, it was a reindeer.
As far as I'm concerned, all you've done is miss a parole meeting.
You're not gonna send me back to prison?
I won't send you back to prison.
All right, we're, well, we're at a place called Hermey's Tower in Suffolk.
We'll wait for you here, all right?
You're not sending him back to prison?
No.
You are.
Santa.
Barber!
You've got to help me.
You've got to call Steve.
I just spoke to him.
He's through with you.
Steve would never give up on Christmas.
Steve knows all about Harry Mitchell.
Who?
BARBER:
You know who.
Now, listen, you're getting a very good friend of mine in a lot of trouble.
And that can't happen.
Do you understand me?
SANTA:
Barber, it's Christmas Eve!
- You have to help me!
- INMATE:
Shut it!
Why would someone lie about something like this?
I don't know.
Sometimes adults like to tell fibs.
Yeah, but not about something as big as this.
Do you remember the last time I saw you and I told you a story?
It was a spaceman story about an astronaut going on a long and dangerous mission to Mars, and the only thing to keep him going on this mission was the love that he had for his son.
And I told you that story for a reason.
You didn't want me to forget you.
You wanted me to know that someday you'd be a good dad.
You are a good dad.
The best.
But that still doesn't explain why Santa would lie.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, sometimes people like to tell stories, you know?
Maybe he just likes to tell people that he's Santa Claus, flying around the world on his sleigh.
TOM:
It's the sky!
What is?
That's the North Star.
This is the Plough.
So that...
That's the North Star.
Look, it's...
It's a code.
So, if I move this to here and this to here... (CLANKING AND WHIRRING)
(RUMBLING)
This isn't a map.
This is instructions.
And that's not a tower.
It's a letter box.
This must be one of the routes for the letters to get to Lapland.
This must be a slide for Santa to get to Lapland.
You can't take a slide all the way to Lapland.
It would take weeks.
- Well, let's go down it.
- Oh, no, we won't.
(DASHER BELLOWS)
- What?
- (FARTS)
Sometimes you fart, sometimes you truffle.
Be more specific.

Slowcombe's a relative of friends of mine outside, and they want him sprung so he can join his dad.
Yeah, wasn't his dad... (HIGH-PITCHED TONE)
Now a change to the schedule.
Unconfirmed reports just in from Sydney, Australia, that thousands of children have awoken on Christmas morning to discover their stockings empty.
Can this really be the first time that Santa has failed to deliver?
I hope, and I'm sure I speak for all of us, I hope this is not true.
Ugh!

I'm Steve, and this is my son Tom.
Why are you here?
Um, we've come to rescue Santa.
Why?
What have you done with him?
What do you mean, what have we done with him?
- He's in prison.
- Prison?
- MAN 2:
What's happened?
- MAN 3:
No.
Um, he crashed his sleigh and he got arrested for trying to rescue his reindeer.
You see, Entwhistle?
I told you so.
It doesn't prove anything.
BUSTER:
It proves you don't listen to Buster.
Who test-drives his new sleigh two days before Christmas?
Stop making this personal, Buster.
This is not about you.
Excuse...
Sorry, excuse me.
Are you, er, elves?
ENTWHISTLE:
Why, yes.
Is this Elf City?
This is a forest, a forest that surrounds Elf City.
Elf City is that way.
Come this way.
- ELF 1:
Come on.
- ELF 2:
Follow us.
I never thought it was real.
Not even as a boy.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
ENTWHISTLE:
He's gone missing before but never for this long.
And never on Christmas Eve.
At this rate there won't be enough time.
TOM:
Well, what are we gonna do?
ENTWHISTLE:
Come up with a plan.
(WIND WHISTLING)
Operations.
I'm just putting you through now.
WOMAN:
With you in a mo, Binky.
WOMAN 2:
Send more wrapping paper your way.
WOMAN 3:
Terribly sorry, they're busy right now.
WOMAN:
Roger.
Over and out.
ENTWHISTLE:
Arts and crafts have knocked up a map of the prison.
Now, I apologise it's not to scale, but they've done the best they could under the circumstances.
We believe Santa's where?
General population, C block.
Hmm.
Is he gettable?
Can we get to him?
STEVE:
No.
I mean, maybe.
You're quite sure there's no magic dust left in the main sleigh?
- Quite sure.
It was completely empty.
- Well, that's it, then, lads.
It's over.
Wait.
So Santa crashed the new sleigh.
- Then there must be an old sleigh.
- ENTWHISTLE:
Yes.
So why can't we just fly in and get him?
Elves aren't allowed to fly the sleigh.
- Why?
- ENTWHISTLE:
Medical reasons.
What medical reasons?
If we fly over a thousand feet, we explode.
Oh.
Look, I hate to be the grump here, but I'm also the realist.
He's missed New Zealand and he's also missed Australia, not to mention Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga.
And pretty soon the world's gonna wake up to discover Santa's gone AWOL.
It's over, elves.
It's over.
STEVE:
There's a door on the roof.
It's not on your map.
It's an emergency door.
We used it for a fire drill once.
Now, this door leads to a main atrium, with access to all the cells.
Now, if you can figure out a way of getting me airborne,
I'll fly in,
I'll land on the roof and I'll get him out of there.
(LAUGHS)
(ALL LAUGHING)
Just cos you think you're a getaway driver, you think you can fly a sleigh.
ENTWHISTLE:
That's a very courageous offer, Steve, but to fly the sleigh takes an awful lot of training.
- Dad's a brilliant driver.
- ENTWHISTLE:
Even so.
Santa came to me for a reason.
"Santa came to me." Ha!
You tell me to run this like a business?
He's making it personal.
Look, even if you could fly the sleigh, Steve, we've only got one reindeer left.
He's retired and he's got three teeth.
SPECS:
Well, Prancer could make it to the prison.
We'll then just need our friends to get Santa to the main sleigh.
And what about the six reindeer being held in Richmond Park?
Parachute Oswald in.
(SQUEAKY CHATTERING)
We know Dasher will make his own way there.
Oswald simply needs to free the others and get them to the main sleigh.
And we forget about the unfolding nightmare in Australia?
Who's to say he hasn't left the Australian kids their presents already?
In their back yards, in their garages, on the beaches.
Santa'll make it on time.
And so will we.
It's not personal, Buster.
It's strictly business.
♪ (PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) ♪
ENTWHISTLE:
Here we go.
It's the Northern Lights.
ENTWHISTLE:
There are no Northern Lights.
We create it with the magic powder.
Fortunately, with a bit of misinformation from the science community, no-one questions it.
- Yeah, but how does that help us?
- The reindeer run on the green light.
Oh, right.
Is he all right?
Prancer won't let you come to any harm.
Come on, quick.
Jump aboard.
SPECS:
Oswald is on the back.
Right.
Put this around your wrist.
It will open any lock.
Just grab hold of the door handle and the mechanism will do the rest.
The other apparatus you'll have to figure out for yourself.
BUSTER:
Here's the magic powder.
Take the gun, and if the lights go faint, just fire the gun again.

Yes, thank you.

OK, so we're just coming up to Richmond Park.
Prepare Oswald.
Er, how do I prepare him?
Dunno.
Has he got a parachute?
There's no parachute.
Well, maybe it's a magic box.
Well, how do we know?
(OSWALD SQUEAKS)
It's not magic.
Go, Oswald!
Oi, Santa.
Stop your snivelling and listen up.
I just got word they're transferring you to a more secure prison.
- But they can't.
- Well, they are.
Fortunately for you, Knuckles wants you out, so here's the plan.
A guard will collect you and walk you straight past the gym.
That's where I'll be hiding, right?
When it kicks off, wade in, and wade in hard.
I don't want the guard kicking me round the cell like a football.
- I don't think I can do this.
- Yes, you can.
I wonder what Santa's got in his bag.
What you got there?
What, do you want me to land this thing in the dark?

Oh, he's known for his diligence.
Steve saw me when he was a child.
I'd given him a Rubik's cube.
He still hasn't managed to solve it to this day, but unlike nearly every other child in the world, he hasn't cheated and he hasn't given up trying.
Thank you for all your kind words, but I really think it's time you got going.
Oh, no.
You're all under arrest.
You don't have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court.
In that case, I'd like to say something.
Let it be known, for the record, that Steve and Thomas Anderson have saved Christmas for the world entire.
You can't take that away from them, even if you can take away their freedom.
Don't worry.

There have been sightings as far west as Ealing Broadway.
No-one knows where they came from, so let's just hope they're not Santa's reindeer, or there'll be a lot of disappointed children this Christmas.

We have to stop the train!
There are people on board!

No, the old lady got really mangled up.
She's in a mess.

Ah, but fortunately there's an ambulance nearby.
Nee-nah!

- No, today's not a good day.
- Ah, come on, Ali.
You can't just change the plans cos you have something better to do tomorrow.
No, I haven't got anything better to do.
Well, we'll see you then.
I've gotta go.
All right.
Thank...
Thank you.
Was that Dad?
- Yeah, that was Steve.
- Why didn't you let him come over?
Because you'll have more time with him tomorrow.
- What if he doesn't come tomorrow?
- He will.
He won't if you're being horrible to him.
Tom...
Just try and give him the benefit of the doubt.
I'm just scared he's gonna build Tom up with promises and then let him down.
Everybody deserves a second chance.
- Steve's had about 12.
- I know.
Let's just try and have a nice Christmas.
Don't you like the fly?
Will you have a little grub?
Come in.
Mr Anderson, do take a seat.
No?
Don't want a fly?
- Mince pie?
- Er, no, thank you.
Do you understand what my job is?
Yeah, it's to make sure that I don't fall back into a life of crime.
Yeah.
Hmm.
It's also to catch you when you do.
- And I will catch you.
- I'm not gonna do anything wrong.
- I'm sure you hear that all the time.
- All the time.
- But this time it's true.
- But this time it's true.
I want you, for the next two months, to come to this office every day at 5:00, starting tomorrow, excluding Christmas Day.
Is that clear?
Miss an appointment and I'll assume you're stealing, and I'll send you back to prison.
Er, just for the record, I wasn't actually at the stealing end of the business.
- I was the getaway driver.
- Oh.
That's right.
You were the getaway driver...
Who didn't get away.
Is there any reason why you are still here?
No.
Hello?
Hello!
My letter.
Ho, ho, ho!
I've been old for a thousand years and I'm not getting any younger.
- Are you the real Santa?
- Why, yes!
Shouldn't you be in Lapland, sorting out everyone's toys?
Sorting out toys, working out flight paths, feeding reindeer.
Loading, stowing, stacking, labelling, cladding, packing, ribboning, wrapping, and that's before I even think about turning the Northern Lights on.
Arcs, but more like curtains of...
Of green.
It doesn't look to me like it's cascading down.
It looks like it's rising up from the ground.
- Hello?
- Hello.
Tom?
I can't talk loudly or Mum will hear.
Hello, mate.
How are you?
How are you doing?
Santa's in the garage.
What?
He says that we've got to help him get home.
- He says he knows you.
- Are you in the garage with a man?
No, I'm in the house.
Santa's in the garage.
OK, Tom, can you put your mum on, please?
No, I can't.
Santa says it has to be you.
Tom, listen to me...
He's crashed his sleigh, lost his reindeer, and if we don't help him...
- Tom, go and get your mother.
Please.
- No.
I'm going back to the garage.
- Santa wants to show me his plan.
- Tom.
Tom.
I'm worried about the reindeer.
It's only natural.
Prancer is the oldest...
Steve!
Who the hell are you?
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?
- You know who I am.
- I what?
- You know who I am.
- I haven't got a clue who you are.
He's Santa!
OK, just so we're clear, the only reason I haven't knocked your block off is because of him, so whatever your reason is for being here now it better be a good one.
I was running in my new sleigh.
I came in too low, hit a telephone wire, got thrown off and hit my head.
Tom?
He's lost his reindeer, and if he doesn't get to Lapland, Christmas is off.
All right, Tom.
When your father was your age, he saw me.
- What are you talking about?
- It was Christmas Eve.
You saw a shooting star racing across the heavens.
- That was me.
- Tom?
- Tom, are you in there?
- We need to help him, Steve.
- Tom, who are you talking to?
- Go on, you get out of here.
- And don't you ever come back.
- Bye, Tom.
Don't worry.
Tom, inside.
- Steve.
- Toby.
It's...
It's Tony.
What is it, T?
It's nothing.
It's just a cat.
Hello, boys.
Shh.
Shh!
It's me.
There you are.
You're all here.
Thank goodness.
I was so worried about you.
Antlers up.
Who wants to go home?
All of you?
Right, leave it to me.
Now, if I can just get them airborne...
Toe tap right, toe tap left.
Swing the arms.
Four more...
This is the scene from Sydney, Australia, where Christmas Eve begins just like any other day.
Big steps, count four.
Yesterday we told you about reindeer running over Tower Bridge, and now this festive story has taken another mysterious twist.
A man in his 60S, claiming to be none other than Father Christmas, broke into Battersea Dogs Home, where the reindeer are being housed, and tried to catapult them over the fence.
It looks like Santa will be spending Christmas in prison.
But don't worry, kids.
He's not the real Santa.
How do we know?
Because Santa's reindeer can fly.
Ten sticks of rock.
As a matter of fact, they're called candy canes.
Ten sticks of rock.
- Letters.
- Forty-one.
Forty-one letters.
Oi, pops!
What am I getting for Christmas?
Send him a letter like everyone else!
All right, lads, leave it out.
Oi, Santa!
Are you gonna escape up the chimney?
Eh?
Right, stop.
This one.
This one.
I'd get changed if I was you.
You can't keep me in here.
Room not to your liking, sir?
Oh, wait, I do apologise, but all the sea-view rooms are taken.
Officer, please, this is very, very important.
You have to let me out of here or Christmas will be cancelled.
Hello, mate.
Take me to see Santa or I'm not coming.
That's the deal.
Take it or leave it.
I'll take it.
When are you going to get rid of this old banger?
Oh, now, now.
This old banger treated us well.
- I made you both a packed lunch.
- Thank you.
- Have fun.
- We will.
Thank you.
Bye.
Love you.
I'm sorry about last night.
So, do you wanna go and see Father Christmas?
What do you say we swing by Harrods?
Santa's in prison.
What?
No.
No.
We can't go and see that old fruitcake from last night.
He's not a fruitcake.
Well, he's definitely a few fries short of a Happy Meal.
He's Santa.
Look, Tom, I can't get us into prison to go and see him.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
No, wait, wait, wait.
There might be a way.
Table six.
You've got five minutes.
Right, I'll tell you what.
If I...
When I prove that he's not Father Christmas, can we just forget all of this and have a nice day together?
Mm?
OK.
Thank you for coming.
This place is horrible.
Yeah, well, it's not a holiday camp, Nick.
- You know my name.
- I worked it out.
- How?
- Well, I thought of Saint Nicholas, and then I abbreviated it to Saint Nick.
And then, I took away the "Saint".
That's exactly how I came to it.
Oh, wow!
What do you know?
I tried other more elaborate names, but that one seemed to stick.
- We've come to rescue you.
- Thank goodness.
Yeah, we thought we'd free your reindeer and fly in and pick you up.
No, that wouldn't work because the reindeer can't actually fly.
I mean, not by themselves, but...
Well, it's complicated.
But if you find the sleigh, I mean, provided it's not broken, then you might be able to.
Are you on medication?
Or worse, are you not on medication?
Ho, ho, ho!
- You still don't believe I'm Santa.
- Do you wanna know why?
- Because I'm 30.
- But once you were seven.
Yeah, and I saw a shooting star.
Tell me something I don't know.
It was an exceptionally cold Christmas night.
Your parents were drunk.
They'd been rowing.
- My parents got divorced.
- This was their last Christmas together.
You ran out into the back garden.
You were crying.
You heard a noise in the skies above you.
The sound of bells, sleigh bells, and that's when you saw me.
You knew it wasn't a shooting star.
That's just what your mother told you.
But you had proof.
You found a gift in the garden, a gift that I had left for you.
What was it?
Do you remember?
Why don't you tell me?
It was the most popular gift of that year.
A Rubik's cube.
You still have it, don't you?
Not because of me.
Oh, no.
No, you kept it because that was the last family Christmas you ever had.
How do you know that?
Because he's Santa.
Deep in your heart, you know who I am.
Deep in my heart, you're a nutbag.
The reindeer have been moved to a private area in Richmond Park.
Go there.
Seek out Dasher.
He knows what to do.
- Dasher speaks?
- He communicates.
Right, that's it, I've had enough of this.
We haven't seen each other in a very long time, OK?
And I wouldn't ask this if it wasn't the most important job in the world.
- Come on, we're going.
- We had a deal.
What, you wanna spend our day looking for a talking reindeer?
- Yes.
- OK, then, that's what we'll do.
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
- Come on.
- One more thing.
How do I survive in this place?
Erm, stop pretending to be Father Christmas.
Steve.
Go and see the barber.
- Er, I can't change my look.
- For advice.
Tell him I sent you.
Excuse me.
Are you the barber?
- No, I'm the vet.
- They keep animals here?
Yeah, they keep all sorts of animals in here.
Do they keep reindeer?
- Are you trying to be funny?
- No, I'm trying to find the barber.
It's pretty obvious I'm the barber, isn't it?
Steve Anderson said you'd be able to help me.
- You know Steve?
- I know Steve very well.
- Do one.
- Eh?
Do one.
Any friend of Steve's a friend of mine.
Oh, that's great news!
A friend is exactly what I need.
What can I do for you?
Well, it's rather a long story.
Take a seat, pops.
The one thing we've got in here is time.
Well, I was born in Lapland a long time ago.
Neighbourhood I grew up in was a small town in the Laughing Valley of Hohaho.
Although my childhood was happy, one day an old woodcutter told me about all the poverty in the world.
And I was so shocked that I went straight to Elf City.
Now, the elves are wonderful toy makers, as you know.
So I went there with a mission, that on Christmas morning, from that day forth, every child would get a toy.
I know what you're thinking.
Where do the reindeer come in?
Right, so there's six reindeer, and they all look like, er, reindeer.
None of them appear to be talking, but...
No, hang on, one second.
Oh, no, he's just eating grass.
Why are you acting like an idiot, Steve?
You know, it wouldn't hurt you to call me Dad once in a while, cos, like it or lump it, that's what I am.
Lump it.
You're not going over the fence.
Get off the fence.
Oi, you're not climbing over the fence.
Right, that's it, mister.
Me and you are now officially no longer friends.
So, as we speak, Steve and his son Tom are rescuing my head reindeer, Dasher, who will then lead them to my new magic sleigh.
They will then be able to fly in and spring me from prison.
Well, me first advice is don't tell anyone about this.
- Yeah, not in here.
- OK.
In fact, I think it might be better if we create a whole new back story for you.
You know, one where you won't end up in a psychiatric unit.
- You don't think they'll believe me?
- I'm positive they won't.
So instead of "Santa Claus", let's pretend your name's,
I don't know, something like Mad Jimmy Claws.
You're a veteran safe cracker, bank robber, all-round bad guy.
Mad Jimmy Claws?
Yeah.
Do you like it?
- I think it's horrible.
- It's supposed to be.
Show me your gangster face.
- My what?
- Your mean face.
Hmm?
Now, if you're gonna be Mad Jimmy Claws, you've gotta be...
- Mad.
- No, not mad crazy.
Just mean.
Mean.
- No, mean.
- Mean.
Don't ever do that again.
OK, so, Dasher, if you are here, your boss wants us to spring him from prison, and he says that you would know what to do.
- Nothing.
- He might be shy.
Or he might be a reindeer that doesn't speak.
Dasher, we're your friends.
We're not going to hurt you.
If you're here, just show yourself.
Santa didn't say he spoke.
He said he communicated.
That's not a communication.
That's a fart.
Hello, reindeer.
If any of you are trying to speak, fart now.
Oh, come on.
If one of you is Dasher, fart now.
Dasher's not here.
- What, that's your proof?
- No.
That's my proof.
Santa has seven reindeer.
All right, so what does that mean?
No, no, no, no.
Quick, run!
This is Sierra 15.
We're in pursuit of a man and child on suspicion of...
- Why are we chasing them?
- Suspected reindeer rustling.
- Oh, come on.
Come on, come on.
- This van's rubbish.
She's a bit rusty.
But that's what happens when you've been locked up for two years.
- Come on!
- Hurry.
This is bad, Tom.
This is really, really bad.
If I get caught, I'm going straight back to...
Oh, my!
Dasher.
It's him.
Do you think he can fly us out of here?
No, I do not think he can fly us out of here.
Dasher, can you fly?
Will you stop asking him questions, please?
- It really is him, isn't it?
- Well, it is a reindeer, yes,
I will give you that.
I'm really sorry, I think we should get back onto the road.
If we stay on the grass, we're going to be blocked in.
- Gatehouse, this is Finkerton.
- Who?
- Sergeant Finkerton.
- Finker what?
Finkerton!
Thames Valley Police.
We have some traffic coming your way.
Be sure to stop it.
Over!
- What are we gonna do now?
- Well, we either stop or we don't.
Don't!
That was brilliant!
Yes, but definitely not within the terms of my parole.
Not tough enough?
Well, you're walking like you need the toilet.
All right.
- How about this?
- Yeah, come on.
- Fractionally better.
- Oh, good.
Now, remember, anyone stares at you, you stare right back at them, yeah?
Don't be afraid, but don't be stupid either.
And if they won't budge, tell 'em to get out of your face.
Get out of your face!
No, not get out of their face.
Get out of your face.
Get out of their face.
Get out of your face.
No.
Get out of me face.
- Get out of me face.
- That's it, yeah.
- Yeah, OK.
- Get out of me face.
- Get out of me face.
- Get out of me face.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
- Very good.
Right, in the chair.
- Not...
- No, no, no, don't worry.
I'm not gonna cut your beard.
Just a few finishing touches.
- What's he doing?
- Stop the van.
- Why?
- Stop the van.
- I think he wants to get out.
- I wanna know how he got in.
- Dad, hurry!
- Wait up.
Dasher!
Dasher?
Dasher!
If that really is your name.
Dasher!
He really is Santa, isn't he?
Straight outta Compton It's a crazy brother named Ice Cube
From the stupid-dope gang with a attitude
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Kick knowledge and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you get with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your back, that's how I'm goin' out
For the sucka dumb brothas that's showin' out
Some start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot like gumbo
Goin' off on everybody like that
With bass that's droppin' in your face
So give it up smooth...
An elf!
What did you call me?
Goodness.
Why wasn't your absence noted by your elf leader?
What are you, a comedian?
Are you part of Entwhistle's theatre troupe?
You'd best back up, crazy beard, before I slap that stupid grin off your face.
Wait a minute.
I know what you're doing.
You're doing your mean face.
- My what?
- You're in character.
He's good.
Except I have a secret weapon up my sleeve.
A song that no elf can resist singing along to.
Elves are good, elves are strong
Making toys all night long
In the snow, in the rain Making toys is not a strain
Working hard Stacking shelves
We don't know cos we are elves We are elves, we are...
You're not an elf, are you?
No.
Do you know who the smallest people in the world are?
- Not elves?
- Bullies.
Inside, bullies are this small.
I'm bigger than you, pal.
Remember that.
I don't think calling someone an elf is an insult, do you?
Yeah.
Oi, Sally, what are you doing here?
I thought you was escaping last night.
- Is his name Sally?
- His prison name's Sally.
Sally Gunnel, tunnel.
Cockney rhyming slang.
On account he tells everyone he's digging a tunnel to get out of here.
He's as mad as you.
Hello?
Oh, hello, mate.
Will you put that Santa bloke on, please?
What's going on?
What are you indulging this plan for?
Just put him on, mate, will you?
- Hello.
Steve?
- Oh, yeah.
Hello.
Um...
So we found...
Well, we've got a reindeer and some sort of a, well, yeah, it's a weird sleigh thing.
Oh, Steve, that's great!
What should I do now?
Go to the rear of the vehicle, and there you'll find a compartment with a picture of a,
- well, a rather nice picture of a...
- Elf in a jumpsuit?
Correct.
Yes.
Now, there's a handle at the back.
Now, make sure it's secure, but whatever you do don't pull it all the way out because that way you'd lose the magic powder, which would be a disaster.
Uh...
- Well, it's empty.
- No.
Yeah.
And all the...
All the green sort of dust stuff is all on the...
It's all over the ground.
Well, well, well.
If it ain't the one they call Santa C.
No, his name's Jimmy.
Jimmy Claws.
Who's talking to you, hairdresser?
- I'm just making conversation.
- Well, don't.
Steve, get the emergency kit out of the glove compartment.
Where's the glove compartment?
Where's the...
Hello?
Hello?
I've heard you do a right moody impression of Father Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho!
I mean, no, no, no.
I'm Jimmy Claws, not Santa Claus.
- Get out of my face.
- What you say?
I said, yes, I do a fine impression of Santa Claus.
- Show me.
- What would you like me to say?
- What does FC normally say?
- "FC".
I like that!
"Hello, little girl.
Have you been good?
"Or you been really, really naughty?"
No, no, no.
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Merry Christmas.
Now you're talking.
- You got the job.
- What job?
We're having a Christmas Eve party later for the kids and the families.
We do it every year.
I want you to dress up as Father Christmas and do a turn.
You know, we'll even have the guards get you a costume.
- Would you do that for me?
- Oh, yes!
I mean, sure, I'll do that for you.
If all else fails.
If all else fails, go to Hermey's Tower, Suffolk.
- We can't go to Suffolk.
- Why?
Cos you've gotta be home at 4:00 and I've got a parole meeting at 5:00.
- But we're trying to save Christmas.
- And I'm trying to stay out of prison.
So you're just gonna quit?
I can't miss my parole meeting, Tom.
It's impossible.
I'm sorry.
Then Mum was right about you.
What do you mean?
Why?
What did Mum say about me?
That you'd build me up with promises and then let me down.
That's a very nasty thing to say, and it's not true.
Well, no, actually, it is true.
I am immensely unreliable and I always let people down, which is precisely the reason why Santa would never choose me for this so-called mission.
Yeah?
Well, he did.
So he must have had a good reason.
All I wanted today was a chance to be a proper dad.
Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting to see you?
Two years, one month and three days.
That's right.
Santa's relying on you, Dad.
Hello.
Hello, Miss Mawbury, it's Steve Anderson here.
Oh, Steve.
To what do I owe this misfortune?
I was just wondering if it would be possible to cancel...
Postpone our meeting until next week.
You see, something quite important has just come up with my son.
My dear boy, if you don't come and visit me today at 5:00, then you'll be having Christmas dinner behind bars.
- Comprende?
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely clear.
Well, thank you, thanks very much for being so understanding.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Did you hear what I said?
Let's go save Christmas.
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time
It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up, jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock...
This is amazing.
...in Jingle Bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time
It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up, jingle horse, pick up your feet...
We are yet to ascertain whether the stolen deer was one of those from the Tower Bridge or one of the royal deer living in the adjacent field.
You mean he could have stolen the Queen's deer?
That's right, sir.
So we have an offence against the realm.
Er...
No, sir.
That's...
That's killing swans.
Hello, Ruth.
Do come in.
- Have you bought me a gift?
- No.
That's my toad.
He spends Christmas with me.
Steve Anderson, on the other hand, is going back to prison.
It would seem you do have a gift for me after all.
The name of our suspect.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- This is not good.
- What is it, Dad?
No, it's all right.
Don't worry.
Just stay there.
Will it be all right, Dad?
Look, the police are here.
Let me deal with it.
Don't say anything.
And will you close those curtains, please?
Hello, Officer.
- Looks like your head gasket's blown.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right, little man?
- We'll be fine, thank you.
- You got cover?
No, but a friend has got a breakdown vehicle, so I'll just call him.
OK, well, my advice would be to sit up on the bank.
- Don't want anyone crashing into you.
- No, we don't.
Thank you, sir.
- Right.
- All right, you have a good... day.
So what have you got in there?
A...
A dog.
Yeah?
What kind of dog?
A...
A very big one.
That's a funny-looking dog.
Oh, God!
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Bad deer.
Bad deer.
- Is he dead?
- No, he is not dead.
Don't even say that.
But he is gonna wake up in 10 minutes with a very sore head.
What are we gonna do?
It'll be fine, Dad.
He'll understand.
No, he won't.
"Bah, humbug!" No, that's too strong
Cos it is my favourite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just cos it's "'tis the season"
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from
Last year, ski shop
Encounter, most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines
So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year
Go on, get in, quick.
One sec.
It's all right.
We're not the first people to try that.
Actually, we probably are.
- You've done well, pops.
- We did well.
We couldn't have done it without you, though.
It's teamwork, that's all.
Imagine what you men could achieve on the outside if you all pulled together.
- Yeah.
- We talk about nothing else.
- Who are you?
- I am what you see.
Well, you've certainly got the routine down if nothing else.
I've got a mate of mine that can get hold of some moody Christmas trees.
With you dressed like that, we can knock 'em out for a bull's-eye a piece.
Your name's Roger Shaw.
You grew up in Bethnal Green.
When you were nine, you wrote to me and asked for a bike.
I brought you one.
It was silver.
Two days later, your father sold it to make ends meet.
Your name is Sam Peters.
You were born in Torquay, Devon.
When you were six, you wrote to me and asked for a painting set.
I brought you one and you used it every day.
Until your friends told you it was girly and you threw it in the bin.
Your name is Marlon Baxter.
When you were seven, your mother left you and your father and you wrote to me asking for her to come home.
Well, that's not the sort of wish I can grant.
But she's alive and living in Leeds in Yorkshire, and not a single day goes by when she doesn't regret what she did.
Should I carry on?
No.
I'm Santa, Father Christmas, call me what you want.
With the help of two friends, I intend to escape from here tonight so that I can deliver presents to all the children in the world.
Wait.
What friends?
Steve Anderson.
You may know him.
And his son Tom.
You put the fate of Christmas in the hands of that monkey?
Steve is very reliable.
Steve Anderson is a lot of things, but reliable is not one of 'em.
You stick with me, pops.
I'll get you out.
Oh...
Hello, hello, hello!
Come and get your tickets to our fabulous production of Cinderella!
Come and see me get my man.
And here he is, his most excellent radiancy, his royal Prince Charming.
- Isn't that the van from earlier?
- Well, possibly.
But you either wanna pick up a reindeer or you don't, and, besides, he could be anywhere now.
No.
Hello, Alison.
Hello, Steve.
How are things?
Yeah, good, thank you, yeah.
We're having a lovely day.
- How are you?
- I'm having a cup of tea with the police.
- Oh, that's not good, is it?
- Let me speak with Tom.
All right.
- It's your mum.
- Hey, Mum.
Where are you, sweetie?
Just saving Christmas with Dad.
Sweetheart, we've been really worried about you.
- Your dad is in heaps of trouble.
- He didn't do anything wrong.
Look, you must tell me where you are.
No.
Hiya.
Please, bring him home.
Alison, you really need to just trust me on this one, OK?
Hello, Steve.
This is Ruth.
Yes, I just wanted to make you aware that the only thing right now between you and prison is me.
This is your last chance.
Mummy!
Mummy, look!
I said to you, I said to you just stay in the field, didn't I?
It's OK, everyone.
It's just part of the show.
Come on.
Tom, go in the theatre.
Go in the theatre.
Dad, what's going on?
Dad, what are we doing?
All right, mate?
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show
When I discovered that they were smuggling a reindeer, that's when the driver attacked me.
Police are now searching for this man, thought to be accompanied by his son and a stolen reindeer.
This time around
I am gonna do it
Like you never knew it
Oh, I'll make it through
The time has come for me
To break out of this shell
I have to shout
That I am coming out
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Hermey's Tower, Suffolk?
The reindeer goes in the back.
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show
Dad, what's the latest we can get Santa and still save Christmas?
- I've put 11:00.
Is that OK?
- Um, can we talk about it later?
Hmm.
I'm coming
I'm coming out
Coming...
FC, come and taste this.
- What is it?
- Magic trifle.
Magic trifle!
It's horrible.
What's in it?
Prison-made alcohol.
- Not to your liking?
- No, no.
Then I'll definitely swerve the cookies.
What on earth are you wearing?
What do you mean, what am I wearing?
I'm Santa's little helper.
In more ways than one.
Stay close to him, cos he's your insurance policy out of here.
- What do you think of the costume?
- Terrible.
The cuffs are wrong, collar's wrong and the hat's completely wrong.
Peter Pan.
This is it.
Hermey's Tower.
Tom, will you just wait, please?
I can wait too, if you like.
Erm, no, we'll be all right from here.
Thanks very much, though.
You know, I was the same after my divorce.
Trying to do too much to make things right.
It's OK.
Sometimes it's better to listen to your heart more than to your head.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Where do you think he's heading?
We're currently looking into whether he has any friends or family in Suffolk.
Would you like my take?
Well, I can't help but feel we're gonna get it.
I just received a phone call from Lambeth Prison.
Steve broke his parole conditions and paid a visit to this man.
I did a little research.
This picture is 20 years old.
A friend of mine from the Yard just sent it over.
He looks the same age.
His name is Harry Mitchell.
He was arrested Christmas '92 for trying to climb down someone's chimney.
Well, he's mad, obsessed with Christmas.
So what?
He escaped out of the police vehicle on the way from court.
They still don't know how he did it.
It would appear he's something of an escape artist.
I just rang the governor at Lambeth to let him know.
- What's going on?
- Come on, Harry,
- you're coming with us.
- We're having a Christmas party.
- Where are you taking me?
- Back to your cell.
But there are children waiting to see me.
We're just running a few checks, Harry.
That's all.
Harry?
Who's Harry?
It's the same as the picture in the book.
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
It's only got three sides!
"Last collection 24th of December.
"No collection after 12:00 midnight."
What is this?
Hello?
Hello, mate.
Can I speak to Santa, please?
What, you mean Harry Mitchell?
What are you talking about?
Father Christmas, Santa Claus, whatever you wanna call him.
His real name's Mitchell, Harry Mitchell.
- Go on.
- He's got previous.
Arrested in Bradford on a burglary charge.
He's some sort of scam man.
They've got him on temporary lockdown in his cell while they run checks.
Give up on this joker, lad, before you wind up back in here.
Take care.
What's happened?
He's not Santa.
- Yes, he is.
- He's not.
But what about the sleigh?
And Dasher?
And all the stuff he knew about you?
I don't know.
Some sort of weird trick.
- It's not, Dad.
- Look, look around you, Son.
It's not Santa's grotto.
It's some sort of a water tower.
What about the book?
What about it?
I don't know.
Maybe we're in the wrong place.
Maybe there's another tower.
OK, listen to me, Tom.
I'm in a great deal of trouble, all right?
The sooner we call off this whole search thing, the better it'll be for me.
Thank you.
Lambeth Prison have Harry Mitchell in his cell.
- They obviously trust your instincts.
- Well, I'm glad somebody does.
Well, maybe I do owe you an apology.
Hmm, that's very gracious of you.
We don't have to be friends for me to admire your wisdom.
Find Steve Anderson and we can all let our hair down.
Well, well, well.
Steve.
All right, just listen to me or I'm ringing off.
I didn't hit that policeman, all right, in the van.
It was Dasher.
I mean, it was a reindeer.
As far as I'm concerned, all you've done is miss a parole meeting.
You're not gonna send me back to prison?
I won't send you back to prison.
All right, we're, well, we're at a place called Hermey's Tower in Suffolk.
We'll wait for you here, all right?
You're not sending him back to prison?
No.
You are.
Santa.
Barber!
You've got to help me.
You've got to call Steve.
I just spoke to him.
He's through with you.
Steve would never give up on Christmas.
Steve knows all about Harry Mitchell.
Who?
You know who.
Now, listen, you're getting a very good friend of mine in a lot of trouble.
And that can't happen.
Do you understand me?
Barber, it's Christmas Eve!
- You have to help me!
- Shut it!
Why would someone lie about something like this?
I don't know.
Sometimes adults like to tell fibs.
Yeah, but not about something as big as this.
Do you remember the last time I saw you and I told you a story?
It was a spaceman story about an astronaut going on a long and dangerous mission to Mars, and the only thing to keep him going on this mission was the love that he had for his son.
And I told you that story for a reason.
You didn't want me to forget you.
You wanted me to know that someday you'd be a good dad.
You are a good dad.
The best.
But that still doesn't explain why Santa would lie.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, sometimes people like to tell stories, you know?
Maybe he just likes to tell people that he's Santa Claus, flying around the world on his sleigh.
It's the sky!
What is?
That's the North Star.
This is the Plough.
So that...
That's the North Star.
Look, it's...
It's a code.
So, if I move this to here and this to here...
This isn't a map.
This is instructions.
And that's not a tower.
It's a letter box.
This must be one of the routes for the letters to get to Lapland.
This must be a slide for Santa to get to Lapland.
You can't take a slide all the way to Lapland.
It would take weeks.
- Well, let's go down it.
- Oh, no, we won't.
What?
Sometimes you fart, sometimes you truffle.
Be more specific.
- He's telling us to go.
- Tom, no!
Tom!
Tom!
Tom!
Tom, where are you?
Tom!
Tom!
Tom!
Tom, can you hear me?
Dad!
Dad?
No.
Oh, no.
Tom.
Tom!
Tom!
Tom, where are you?
Tom!
Dad!
Dad!
There's a tunnel being dug.
You've heard, I suppose?
When they leave off singing, yeah, yeah.
Slowcombe's a relative of friends of mine outside, and they want him sprung so he can join his dad.
Yeah, wasn't his dad...
Now a change to the schedule.
Unconfirmed reports just in from Sydney, Australia, that thousands of children have awoken on Christmas morning to discover their stockings empty.
Can this really be the first time that Santa has failed to deliver?
I hope, and I'm sure I speak for all of us, I hope this is not true.
Ugh!
Tom.
Tom.
Tom!
Tom!
Tom.
Tom.
Tom.
That was brilliant!
Oh, you're OK.
You're OK.
Hello!
- What is it?
What is it?
- Shh.
- What was that?
- Hello?
Hello?
Who are you?
- Who are you?
- I asked first.
I'm Steve, and this is my son Tom.
Why are you here?
Um, we've come to rescue Santa.
Why?
What have you done with him?
What do you mean, what have we done with him?
- He's in prison.
- Prison?
- What's happened?
- No.
Um, he crashed his sleigh and he got arrested for trying to rescue his reindeer.
You see, Entwhistle?
I told you so.
It doesn't prove anything.
It proves you don't listen to Buster.
Who test-drives his new sleigh two days before Christmas?
Stop making this personal, Buster.
This is not about you.
Excuse...
Sorry, excuse me.
Are you, er, elves?
Why, yes.
Is this Elf City?
This is a forest, a forest that surrounds Elf City.
Elf City is that way.
Come this way.
- Come on.
- Follow us.
I never thought it was real.
Not even as a boy.
He's gone missing before but never for this long.
And never on Christmas Eve.
At this rate there won't be enough time.
Well, what are we gonna do?
Come up with a plan.
Operations.
I'm just putting you through now.
With you in a mo, Binky.
Send more wrapping paper your way.
Terribly sorry, they're busy right now.
Roger.
Over and out.
Arts and crafts have knocked up a map of the prison.
Now, I apologise it's not to scale, but they've done the best they could under the circumstances.
We believe Santa's where?
General population, C block.
Hmm.
Is he gettable?
Can we get to him?
No.
I mean, maybe.
You're quite sure there's no magic dust left in the main sleigh?
- Quite sure.
It was completely empty.
- Well, that's it, then, lads.
It's over.
Wait.
So Santa crashed the new sleigh.
- Then there must be an old sleigh.
- Yes.
So why can't we just fly in and get him?
Elves aren't allowed to fly the sleigh.
- Why?
- Medical reasons.
What medical reasons?
If we fly over a thousand feet, we explode.
Oh.
Look, I hate to be the grump here, but I'm also the realist.
He's missed New Zealand and he's also missed Australia, not to mention Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga.
And pretty soon the world's gonna wake up to discover Santa's gone AWOL.
It's over, elves.
It's over.
There's a door on the roof.
It's not on your map.
It's an emergency door.
We used it for a fire drill once.
Now, this door leads to a main atrium, with access to all the cells.
Now, if you can figure out a way of getting me airborne,
I'll fly in,
I'll land on the roof and I'll get him out of there.
Just cos you think you're a getaway driver, you think you can fly a sleigh.
That's a very courageous offer, Steve, but to fly the sleigh takes an awful lot of training.
- Dad's a brilliant driver.
- Even so.
Santa came to me for a reason.
"Santa came to me." Ha!
You tell me to run this like a business?
He's making it personal.
Look, even if you could fly the sleigh, Steve, we've only got one reindeer left.
He's retired and he's got three teeth.
Well, Prancer could make it to the prison.
We'll then just need our friends to get Santa to the main sleigh.
And what about the six reindeer being held in Richmond Park?
Parachute Oswald in.
We know Dasher will make his own way there.
Oswald simply needs to free the others and get them to the main sleigh.
And we forget about the unfolding nightmare in Australia?
Who's to say he hasn't left the Australian kids their presents already?
In their back yards, in their garages, on the beaches.
Santa'll make it on time.
And so will we.
It's not personal, Buster.
It's strictly business.
Here we go.
It's the Northern Lights.
There are no Northern Lights.
We create it with the magic powder.
Fortunately, with a bit of misinformation from the science community, no-one questions it.
- Yeah, but how does that help us?
- The reindeer run on the green light.
Oh, right.
Is he all right?
Prancer won't let you come to any harm.
Come on, quick.
Jump aboard.
Oswald is on the back.
Right.
Put this around your wrist.
It will open any lock.
Just grab hold of the door handle and the mechanism will do the rest.
The other apparatus you'll have to figure out for yourself.
Here's the magic powder.
Take the gun, and if the lights go faint, just fire the gun again.
Steve, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
Thanks, Dad.
Good luck.
- Don't worry, Dad.
It'll be fine.
- Yeah, it will.
That's it.
This isn't so bad.
I think I've got this.
Dad!
Anderson.
- Anderson?
- Anderson, this is the police.
Show yourself.
Anderson?
"If all else fails...
"Help Santa."
That's been crossed out and replaced with "Get Santa".
"Lambeth Prison, 11:00 p.m. latest.
"Bring magic powder so we can fly."
That doesn't sound good.
OK, so we're just coming up to Richmond Park.
Prepare Oswald.
Er, how do I prepare him?
Dunno.
Has he got a parachute?
There's no parachute.
Well, maybe it's a magic box.
Well, how do we know?
It's not magic.
Go, Oswald!
Oi, Santa.
Stop your snivelling and listen up.
I just got word they're transferring you to a more secure prison.
- But they can't.
- Well, they are.
Fortunately for you, Knuckles wants you out, so here's the plan.
A guard will collect you and walk you straight past the gym.
That's where I'll be hiding, right?
When it kicks off, wade in, and wade in hard.
I don't want the guard kicking me round the cell like a football.
- I don't think I can do this.
- Yes, you can.
I wonder what Santa's got in his bag.
What you got there?
What, do you want me to land this thing in the dark?
If that's the barber, tell him to get Santa ready.
- Hello?
- Where are you?
- Mum?
- Tell me where you are, sweetie.
Um, we're just passing the London Eye.
OK, stay where you are.
I'm coming to get you.
We just passed it.
- We're driving quickly.
- To where?
Er, can I tell her where we're going?
Lambeth Prison.
Tom?
Well, come on then, put the lights back on.
Tom.
He's taking him to prison.
Well, that's the only way down there.
What would Santa do?
Oh, you're kidding me.
There must be something here that can help us.
So, what would happen if I lowered this down here, twisted this.
I've got friends who would love a tool like this.
All right, Tom, you stay up there and keep watch.
Come on, let's find him.
Transfer time, Mitchell.
Now, either you come quietly or I'll get a couple of lads and strap you to a gurney.
- I'll come quietly.
- Thought you might.
Follow me.
There is, of course, the option of an upgrade.
For a few quid I could stick you in the minibus instead of the...
Where are you going?
It's this way.
Sally, where are you?
Oi!
Ah.
Now, perhaps you'd like to tell me what is going on.
Time for parties and celebrations
People dancing all night long
- Time for presents
- Don't just stand there, pops!
- And exchanging kisses
- Do something.
- Time for singing
- Ah.
Christmas songs
We're gonna have a party tonight
I'm gonna find that girl underneath the mistletoe
We'll kiss by candlelight
Snow is falling, snow is falling
All around me, all around me
Children playing, children playing
Having fun, having fun
It's the season
Love and understanding
Merry Christmas, everyone
Merry Christmas, everyone
- Merry Christmas, everyone
- Come here, you little maggot.
What reason could Steve possibly have to take Tom to a prison?
Because he's a dishonest, irresponsible, childish imbecile.
No, no, it doesn't make sense, any of it.
Yeah, maybe the parole officer just got the wrong end of the stick.
Why would he steal a reindeer?
Why would anyone steal a reindeer?
Come on, do something!
I'll do something all right.
I'll stick you in solitary, you wretch.
What's wrong with you?
Don't you wanna save Christmas?
Christmas?
Is that what all this is about?
I hate Christmas.
If I had my way, I'd cancel the lot of it.
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
- Where's Santa?
- I'm Santa.
- No, where's the real Santa?
- He is the real Santa.
Steve.
- What are you doing?
You gone mad?
- Most definitely, mate.
- Where is he?
- He's in his cell.
Come 'ead.
Come 'ead.
Have you been a good boy or have you been very, very naughty?
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
Santa.
They must have moved him into solitary.
Or he's been transferred.
And may all your Christmases...
Knuckles.
Where's Santa?
Steve's here to get him out.
Steve, I thought you'd let him down.
He's with Sal.
I give him a ticket out of here.
Tell me you didn't.
Just like the ones I used to know
- May your days, may you days...
- Have you thought about dieting?
Considering how many mince pies I eat, I think I'm doing very well.
And may all your Christmases
Be white
There was about 15 of 'em, big lads.
I didn't stand a chance.
- Yeah, all right.
Where's Santa?
- I don't know.
No, no, I really don't know.
Wait.
Write him a letter.
Write Santa a letter.
If he's close, it'll find him.
Come on.
Respect to the little man.
Tom, will you just give me two seconds to think, please?
- Search Mitchell's cell.
- Right.
No, you'd best make that one.
You coming?
No, I'm gonna stay, do me time.
Any eyes on the suspect?
- Negative.
- Don't mess this up, Boyle.
This is your chance to shine.
Copy that.
Travelling to Lambeth Prison.
- What are we doing?
- We're running.
I know that.
Where are we running to?
In here.
"Santa.
We're in the prison.
We have the magic powder."
It's Steve.
They have the magic powder.
They're in the prison.
And how exactly is that good news?
Oh, no.
All units be advised, prison break in progress.
Repeat, prison break in progress.
Take the bag.
I'm liable to end up in prison because I think I'm gonna wring his neck.
- Steve?
- Where are you?
We're just coming off Coldharbour Lane.
More importantly, where are you?
We're not far.
Just stay there.
- Who are these clowns?
- Alison.
Ali...
Come on.
- Drive.
- I beg your pardon?
Put your foot on the accelerator and drive.
He most certainly will not!
And if you two don't get out of our car,
Tony's gonna come back there and drag you out.
Well...
Well, um...
Hello.
- Sweetheart!
- Mum!
- Steve!
- Santa!
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
- Any chance we could get going?
- Tony, drive!
You need to take us to a park not far from here where there is a sleigh, and whilst I know it sounds weird...
- He's Santa.
- He really is.
I am.
I'm not an elf.
Can everyone stop being mad, please?
Alison, this man really is the real Santa Claus and if we don't get him to his sleigh right now, then Christmas is cancelled.
- It's true.
- Go, Tony!
- What are you doing?
- No idea.
We're in pursuit of suspects, er, on Trith Street, heading west, west, west.
- We need to go faster.
- I'm already doing 60.
Well, do 70.
They're gaining on us.
Is that my tool bag?
- What are they?
- Pellets.
You can't fire pellets at the police.
You can't fire pellets at anyone.
Reindeer pellets.
They're droppings.
- Reindeer poo?
- Very gluey.
Sometimes I use it on my boots so I stick to the roofs.
Specs thought it might come in handy.
He was right.
We're being shot at!
- Yes!
- Get in!
Well, that's three years in prison right there.
That's five years.
Request armed backup.
Repeat.
Officers under fire.
Boyle?
Did you say under fire?
Copy that.
Officers under fire.
Reload!
Ugh.
Ah...
Here.
Ho, ho, ho!
I can see you!
Yes!
In the face.
I'm hit.
I'm hit.
I'm hit.
I'm hit.
Boyle, you hang in there, OK?
Help is on the way!
Boyle?
Boyle!
Oh, my God.
It's poo.
It...
It's poo.
It's poo.
Oh, my God.
It's poo.
Don't worry about that, Boyle.
Accidents happen.
You hang in there.
OK?
Officer down.
Repeat, officer down.
Ambulance on its way.
Ugh, ugh.
How did he get the sleigh off the tracks?
He flew it.
That is one exceptionally clever squirrel.
That's Oswald.
Hello, boys.
Oh, there you are.
Very good.
Oh!
Lovely to see you again, my dears.
Wonderful.
Oh, well done, chaps.
Ah, Dasher, there.
- How much of this stuff shall I put in?
- All of it.
I've got a very long night ahead of me.
Right-o.
So much to do, so little time.
Good work, Oswald.
Well done.
So, can I just ask, is the plan for that thing to fly?
Oh, yes.
- And, er, you're going along with that?
- Yeah.
I spent four years digging a tunnel.
I never imagined my getaway vehicle would be a sleigh.
Climb aboard, Sally.
Mind the squirrel.
All right?
About your letter...
You asked me to stop your dad from letting you down.
That's not the sort of wish I can grant.
But my wish was granted.
But not because of me.
It was because of you.
Sometimes adults aren't quite as grown up as you'd hope.
But what children teach them is love.
Come on.
- It's time.
- Yes.
- Quick, Santa, go!
- Yes, yes.
Flick the reins and fly away?
Can I have your licence and registration documents, please?
Yes, Harry, whilst this all looks very convincing, the outfit and the sleigh, the part that doesn't stack up is why would anyone, least of all Santa Claus, turn to Steve Anderson for help?
It's a fair point.
I came to Steve because he sees things through.
Oh, he's known for his diligence.
Steve saw me when he was a child.
I'd given him a Rubik's cube.
He still hasn't managed to solve it to this day, but unlike nearly every other child in the world, he hasn't cheated and he hasn't given up trying.
Thank you for all your kind words, but I really think it's time you got going.
Oh, no.
You're all under arrest.
You don't have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court.
In that case, I'd like to say something.
Let it be known, for the record, that Steve and Thomas Anderson have saved Christmas for the world entire.
You can't take that away from them, even if you can take away their freedom.
Don't worry.
Sometimes adults find it hard to accept the magic of Christmas.
But when they experience it with their own eyes, even the coldest of hearts warm.
She won't send you back to prison.
Sit back in your seat.
Hold tight.
Thank you, both.
No, thank you.
Merry Christmas to you all.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
"Bah, humbug!" No, that's too strong
Cos it is my favourite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just cos it's "'tis the season"
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from
Last year, ski shop
Encounter, most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines
So deck those halls, trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year
Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chilled this room for 24 days
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with
Flashback to springtime, saw him again
Would've been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't, of course, till summertime
Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him?
No, this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendar's just one page
And of course I am excited
Tonight's the night but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
"A and P" has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh, damn!
Guess what I forgot?
So on with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
"I'm spending this one alone," he said
"Need a break, this year's been crazy"
I said, "Me too, but why are you?
"You mean you forgot cranberries too?"
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending!
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Couldn't miss this one this year

Previouslyon"dallas"...
Nicolas isn't working with cliff.
He's going after the company himself.
Is it done?
Ewing global is officially ours.
We don't have any evidence to stop these people.
I think i know someone who can help.
But it's the last person i want to go to for a favor.
If you don't use your contacts to help me prove
That the cartel was behind the takeover,
I'll be forced to bring candace out of hiding.
Once you take care of our candace problem,
I will agree to increase the amount of product
Running through the pipeline by 25%.
Luis:
Those hands belong to your whore.
It's my gift to you to show you i'm a man of my word.
And this here is to make sure you keep yours.
Double the shipments immediately.
Or they're dead.
[ dog barking ]
Oh!
[ barking continues ]
[ speaking spanish ] [ laughter ] [ man speaking spanish ]
Sit down.
Sit down and don't move.
[ gasps ] [ both gasp ]
I'm sorry if your journey down was a bit rough.
[ grunts ] but bringing you here
Was the only option i had to get judith's attention.
You must be starving.
Can i get you something to drink or eat?
Just water, please.
Where do you think we are?
[ sniffles ]
Mexico?
South texas?
I don't know.
I am so sorry.
This is all my fault.
Let's stay strong, emma.
Together, we're stronger than apart.
Have you accepted my demands?
It's all set.
Our trucks are on their way south.
Promise me that you'll have
All the border people paid off.
Now that we're doing this,
I want it done as quickly as possible.
I can assure you, judith,
Everyone involved in this transaction
Wants our product moved quickly.
Your loved ones, especially.
I'm keeping my end of the bargain, luis,
And i expect you to do the same
Because if something should happen to my granddaughter,
Trust me when i say you and everyone you love
Will die regretting it.
We'll be in touch, judith.
[ sobs ]
If those trucks get stopped at the border [voice breaking] and he does anything to hurt my emma --
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Okay, we are doing exactly as they asked.
They need those trucks.
Mm.
Why don't you go upstairs and lie down?
[ grunts ] come on.
I'll have your medication sent up.
Mm-hmm.
Look, i've got this under control.
You hear me?
Mm.
Man:
Mr. Ryland, you have visitors.
Come on in.
[ door opens ]
Harris, i need your help to contact the cia.
The cartel has taken over ewing global.
Ewing global isn't the only thing they've taken.
♪ ♪ theme music plays ♪ ♪
Hey.
Elena.
What is it?
Something's happened.
I need to explain because i love you.
And i need you to understand, okay?
Okay.
After you and your family moved to texas,
I didn't stay in the catholic school.
I went back to the streets, ellie.
You should've told us, nicolas.
There were some boys dealing drugs.
Pretty soon, the boss of this gang, orestes,
Noticed that i had a facility with numbers.
He told me that i was destined for great things.
[ scoffs ]
And i believed him.
I was thrown in jail a few times.
But orestes got me out.
He sent me to study in europe to become educated,
To become...
Nicolas treviño.
Then orestes started to change.
Mexico's drug trade wasn't enough for him.
He wanted to control the government, too.
I was desperate.
I was tied to a man who had become...
A murderer.
Orestes knew i wanted out, so he made a deal with me.
If i could deliver the funds
To buy the next national election,
I could be free.
In my eagerness, i overreached on an investment
And i lost the cartel more than half a billion dollars.
And then you came back into my life.
Just like when we were children, you saved me.
What are you saying, joaquin?
The ewing global deal.
Orestes forced me to take it for him.
Orestes' last name is mendez-ochoa.
He is the war criminal known as el pozolero.
You used me to pay your debt to the mendez-ochoa cartel!
I am so sorry.
We need to tell the ewings.
We need to tell the s.E.C. So they can fix this.
They can undo this.
We can't.
[ camera shutter clicking ]
There's nothing we can do.
Please, listen to me.
Orestes threatened to kill my sons.
He threatened to kill you.
Hunter mckay set up the shell companies for the cartel.
He is dead.
They're tying up loose ends.
They want me to sell off all the divisions of the company
So they can use the cash to influence the election.
Until then, we are both in danger.
You were the one person i thought i could trust.
[ camera shutter clicking ]
But i never knew you at all.
You need to rescue them now.
We need to find them first.
Then call in all your resources and find them.
Sue ellen:
At least act like you give a damn.
I feel for you all.
I do.
I'm not unsympathetic to your situation.
I have a wife and a daughter, too.
And that is the only reason i'm telling you
As much as i am about a classified cia operation.
But locating and rescuing kidnapped u.S. Citizens
Is not just an operational decision.
It's a diplomatic one, above my pay grade.
Bullshit.
Then call your boss.
I'll call langley right away,
Ask if we can put some pressure on the mexican government
To accelerate a move against the cartel.
But i got to be honest.
I don't think mexican authorities
Will authorize a move unless it gets them el pozolero.
Who?
The head of the mendez-ochoa cartel.
He's been underground for the last four years,
Selling drugs,
Laundering money to liberate mexico.
Both the mexican government and the cia believe catching him
Is the only way to stop
A complete destabilization of the country.
I can appreciate what the cia and the mexican government
Are trying to accomplish.
But i refuse to allow my wife and her daughter
To become collateral damage!
The cartel made it perfectly clear
That if we don't start doubling our shipments immediately,
Ann and emma are dead.
So you tell your bosses i'm moving those drugs
With or without their protection.
Ryland?
What the hell are you doing here?
Why are you all here?
What's going on?
Emma's in this mess because of you, you little shit,
Pushing her to work against me!
[ sighs ]
Ann and emma were kidnapped by the mendez-ochoa cartel.
Ryland's not running drugs like emma told you.
He was working with the cia.
Bobby:
The cartel can't find out about ryland and the cia,
Or ann and emma will be killed.
So, how are you gonna find them?
It turns out a lieutenant in the cartel has them,
A man named luis.
We have two options of tracking him down --
Nicolas treviño, victor des lauriers.
Nicolas is inside man on the i.P.O.
Turns out they were both working together
To steal the company for the cartel.
Christopher:
Finding either one of them could lead us to luis.
And ann and emma.
I'll do what i can to track down des lauriers and treviño.
But i won't be able to get your trucks
Any cia protection at the border.
[ ryland scoffs ]
I'm not gonna wait for the cia to find treviño.
I'm gonna find him myself.
How?
Lucia treviño.
I bet she knows where her husband is.
Sue ellen:
I'll contact carlos.
He has contacts within the mexican government
And the federal police, too.
John ross:
These guys aren't just drug lords.
They're businessmen.
Look, they took ann and emma because they wanted money.
[ cellphone rings ] treviño offered them a deal.
Let's bring them a better one.
Hello?
And what would that be?
What's going on?
I don't know yet.
I'll figure it out.
Check with me before you do something, okay?
Thank you.
What's happening, christopher?
That was the office.
Treviño just sold the consumer division at ewing global.
He's selling our assets at 70 cents on the dollar.
[ gasps ]
With prices like that,
The cartel will get the money they need quickly.
And once they get the money they need...
They won't need hostages.
Emma.
Hmm?
I'll be right back, okay?
Where are you going?
Just sit tight.
If there's a way out of here, i'm gonna try to find it.
Excuse me, señor?
May i go to the washroom, please?
Of course.
Diego will show you the way.
[ speaks spanish ]
Un momento, por favor.
[ dogs barking ]
[ barking continues ]
Hey.
After everything that happened,
I never thought i'd see you anywhere near southfork again.
Well, i guess you were wrong, because here i am.
Why are you here?
My father's feud with the ewings is over.
But mine is just beginning.
I'm staying here in this marriage
Until my idiot husband
Can figure out a way to get the company back.
And once he does,
I'm gonna take him for everything he's worth.
Look, i know you hate me, and i don't blame you.
But we got to set our feudings aside, pamela.
Ann and emma have been kidnapped
By the mendez-ochoa cartel.
Oh, my god.
The cartel asked ryland to push more drugs
Through the pipeline
In exchange for ann and emma's freedom.
Christopher's tracking down nicolas,
And i'm gonna try to broker a deal
Between the cartel and nasir.
You think nasir's gonna want
To do business with you again?
Your word means nothing to him.
You might be right.
But i have to try to convince him to trust me again.
Look, if i can get nasir to lend me the money
To buy the divisions the cartel's liquidating [sighs]
I may be able to make a deal for ann and emma's freedom.
Pamela, they are in danger.
I have to do something.
I could really use your help.
I need to unpack.
[ sighs ] [ door closes ]
Lucia:
You shouldn't have come back to mexico, señor ewing.
These parts have been very dangerous lately.
Rebels killing locals and tourists
Without discrimination.
Well, things have been very dangerous in dallas
As well, señora treviño.
That's why i'm here.
I know your husband's real name is joaquin reyes,
And i know that he's in debt to the mendez-ochoa cartel.
The cartel threatened our family
If my husband didn't repay his debt.
Nicolas is a good man.
He's a good father.
He was left with no other choice.
Would a good father who fears for his children's lives
Leave their side
With things as dangerous as you have described?
The cartel has already killed one man
Involved in the ewing global takeover
And has kidnapped two of my family members.
I need to find nicolas
Because i think that he can lead us to them.
[ sighs ]
Nicolas has run off with elena ramos.
Nicolas isn't putting your welfare at the top of his list.
He's holed up somewhere with elena,
And he won't come back for you,
No matter what you tell yourself.
Please, let's help each other.
I'm sorry, mr.
Ewing.
[ sighs ]
I'm not saying you're lying.
I just want to make sure he's getting my messages.
Look, what did he say when you told him i called?
Well, i'm sorry you had to hear that type of language.
[ footsteps approaching ] [ cellphone beeps ]
Here to beat up on me some more?
Get in line.
I got people that hate me on every continent.
Was that nasir?
Yeah.
He hates me, just like you said.
But he doesn't hate me.
What are you saying?
You and emma...
It killed me, john ross.
I believed in both of you.
But ann...
I'll do anything to help her.
Even if it means helping you.
[ cellphone beeps ] [ telephone ringing ]
[ cellphone rings ]
Lucia?
Is everything all right with the boys?
Yes, as all right as things can be with you away.
Where are you, nicolas?
I can't tell you that.
You know it wouldn't be safe
For you and the boys to know where i am.
A bomb went off on the city bus today.
Eight people were killed.
I just don't feel safe here without you.
I've even stopped sending the kids to school.
When are you coming home?
I'm sending a plane for you and the boys immediately.
I want you to go back to the costa azul
Until this is over.
Orestes has possession of ewing global.
Your debt is paid.
What more does he want?
Things have gotten complicated.
Christopher ewing was here looking for you.
He knows your real name.
He knows about your debt to the cartel.
And he said that you and elena were together.
No, christopher is manipulating you
To get you to tell him where i am.
Elena is in a hotel in dallas.
If orestes finds me, i don't want elena hurt
Anymore than i want you and the boys hurt.
Now, may i speak with my sons?
They're with the tutor.
I'll have them call you when they're done.
I know i lied.
I told her you weren't with me, but for good reason.
Lucia is a jealous and impulsive woman.
The last thing i need right now
Is for her to do something rash or stupid.
You should go back.
Be with your family, protect them.
It's too late for me and lucia.
For now, i just need her and the boys to be safe.
I'm protecting them
By making sure my debt is fully paid.
I love you, elena.
And i hope someday you'll be able to forgive me...
For all the terrible things i've done.
[ sighs ]
A proper drink for a proper lady.
[ grunts ]
So...
You were married to harris ryland.
Yes.
A long time ago.
Hmm.
Well, i don't see him deserving you.
Perhaps he was more handsome with hair.
[ cellphone rings ]
Ah.
Excuse me.
Sí.
Dígame.
¿qué?
Imaldita sea!
No!
No!
No, please!
Stop!
No!
No!
What happened?
No!
No!
No!
Stop!
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!
Don't!
Mom!
[ both screaming ]
Emma!
Emma!
[ cellphone rings ]
Hello, luis.
I just got a call from one of my men.
It seems your trucks have been stopped at the border.
Did you not think i was serious about my threat?
This is exactly what i was worried about
In the first place.
Moving more trucks across the border
Always meant more risk.
I warned you this could happen.
But i can fix it,
If you'll just give me a little more time.
And i warned you what would happen
If you didn't do exactly as i asked.
[ whimpers ]
Say hello to your grandma.
[ voice breaking ] i'm sorry, grandma.
This is -- it's all my fault.
I'm so sorry.
[ gasps ]
Oh, god, please don't do that.
[ cries ]
I only need one hostage.
And at this moment, i have two.
Please don't do this.
[ gunshot ]
Aah!
Emma!
Emma!
[ screaming ] [ crying ]
Damn you!
Damn you!
No!
Habla con tu abuela.
I-i'm okay.
Oh!
I'm okay.
Oh!
[ whimpers ]
I want you to think about the emotion you just felt.
And then imagine feeling it
Every day for the rest of your life.
You have one day to get the trucks moving.
[ cellphone beeps ]
She's okay.
Oh, my god.
Oh!
[ crying ]
I thought i lost you.
[ sniffles ] it's okay.
It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.
It's okay.
Shh.
That's what they thought, too.
Senator, we're talking about my wife and my stepdaughter,
Two americans who are in trouble
Because the cia is doing business with the cartel.
The government created this mess.
The government should clean it up...
Now,
Before innocent lives are lost.
Joe:
I wish there was something i could do, bobby,
But our government is weighing the lives of two citizens
Against the security of an entire nation.
I know there's something you can do, joe.
You're a united states senator, for god's sake.
I'll talk to my colleagues on the intelligence committee.
But other than that, my hands are tied.
[ sighs ]
The longer they're there, they... [ sighs ]
Things are escalating, sue ellen.
Look at this.
Man:
Riots broke out again today inthestreetsofmexicocity
Inresponseto themurderof yet another federal magistrate.

Toinfluencetheupcoming presidentialelection.
I should be doing more.
My sister-in-law, sue ellen ewing, made me aware
Of a near breach of one of our gas pipelines.
Leaks happen almost every day.
Even with expedited repairs,
An explosion could happen at any time.
With so many lives at risk in south texas,
I'm proposing we do something about it now.
Well, there is no doubt that gas-pipeline safety
Is an important part of the railroad commission's purview,
But the emergency drill that you're proposing, bobby,
Would involve large-scale evacuations.
We would have to clear train tracks for miles
On both sides of the border.
I'm aware of that.
Tests like that don't come cheap,
Especially on such short notice.
And i'm aware of that.
But cost and inconvenience
Is a small price to pay for human lives.
That's why i'm proposing
We do this emergency training exercise
With our mexican counterparts
So that crews on both sides of the border
Can be well-prepared in case of a gas-pipeline leak.
It's that simple.
I'm gonna step outside.
You two discuss it, and then, uh, we'll take it to a vote.
How did it go?
Well, i'm counting on their instinct
For self-preservation to guide their conscience.
You do realize what will happen if you get caught.
Well, since i don't have immunity from the cia
And i'm going against their wishes
To bring a trainload of drugs across the border,
I'm guessing there'll be a little jail time.
Federal prison.
For the rest of your life.
If it helps bring ann and emma back,
It's worth every day of it.
The last time you were here, mr.
And mrs.
Ewing,
You assured me and my father that you would make good
On j.R.'s pledge to include our family in your plans
For the arctic leases,
Leases that we are not allowed to bid on as foreigners.
And once again,
The ewings failed to make good on their word.
My husband failed to make good on his word.
I was raised to believe
That a wife should support her husband.
I was here last time as just that, a wife.
But today i'm here as a businesswoman,
Your highness, and my word is my bond.
That is the only reason i agreed to this meeting, mrs.
Ewing,
Because i take you as a woman of integrity,
A word foreign to your husband.
Nobody knows that better than i do.
When i married,
Half of everything i owned became my husband's,
Including my shares in barnes global,
The company my father founded.
Indeed.
It was your dowry.
I trusted my husband when he assured me
That we would have controlling interest in the company.
But, instead, he lost it all,
His family's legacy and mine.
Dishonorable and inept,
A most unfortunate combination in a businessman.
I'm here, your highness, because i believe
That my family's loss might be your family's gain.
How so?
The mendez-ochoa cartel
Bought the shares of ewing global with drug money.
Now they're selling off all the divisions
At 70 cents on the dollar.
These are blue-chip divisions we're talking about --
Timber, mining, media, insurance.
If we were to offer, say, 75 cents on the dollar,
I believe we'd be able
To buy it all back in one fell swoop.
Why would i lend you an exorbitant amount of money
To get in business with criminals?
John ross:
Because the methane technology
Is among the assets ewing global has for sale.
Once we buy them back, i'll be able to bid on the arctic leases
Off the alaskan coast, as only an american company can.
Seeing as your family's reserves
Are gonna be dry within five years,
I have a feeling you're gonna be thirsty
For that sweet arctic crude.
I'm intrigued, of course, but skeptical.
I've been burned by the ewings before.
But never by a barnes.
I find your loyalty to your family admirable, mrs.
Ewing.
Ms. Barnes.
Better yet, pamela.
You don't have much time, your highness.
A day maybe.
Nasir, pamela.
I hear sincerity in your voice,
And i see integrity in your eyes.
I will speak to my father right away
And let you know what we decide.
I'm not sure exactly how you pulled it off, ewing,
But you're a lucky man to have such a wife.
[ lucia speaking spanish ]
Arriba.
[ sighs ]
Gracias.
[ sighs ] someone will meet you
At the landing strip and take you to luis.
I told him you would solve our transit problem.
[ vehicle door opens ]
My mother got luis to agree to the meeting with you.
Emma...
Is all i have.
Thank you.
That's how i feel about ann.
Bring them home safe.
We have a deal.
The sheik has agreed to give us the loan.
Thank you for pulling off the impossible, pamela.
You're amazing.
I did it for ann.
And i did it for my legacy.
Nothing's changed between us, john ross.
Christopher:
I'm surprised to hear you were at the gate.
After this morning --
In latin america, the family means everything, mr.
Ewing.
Nothing can be allowed to interfere
With the sanctity of the family.
Even infidelity can't tarnish that sanctity.
So, we give our husbands room to indulge their impulses,
With the unspoken understanding
That our loyalty ends the moment
The family becomes subservient to the mistress.
My family has been threatened,
And my husband has made a choice
To break our family.
Do you know where he is?
Yes.
I know more about my husband than he realizes.
Do you think that daddy will move the trucks in time?
Your father will do everything in his power to save us.
I know that.
[ sighs ]
Ann, would you like to join me for dinner?
Do i have a choice?
Not really.
Sit down.
Please, eat.
[ chuckles ]
I'm glad you like it.
My secret is using the freshest ingredients.
The boy from the farm down the road
Brings me fresh vegetables every day.
2:00 sharp.
Sometimes i let him sample my cooking.
Of course, i'm not the cook el pozolero is.
But i can make a few dishes like this pozole,
A hearty mexican stew.
I believe i've lost my appetite.
Oh, you must've heard about my boss, el pozolero,
And how he got his nickname.
Dissolving the remains of his victims in a stew of acid.
Ahh.
An exaggeration, i can assure you.
Emma and i are your hostages.
We're already at your mercy.
Do you need to terrorize us, too?
I'm sorry.
It's not my intention to terrorize you.
I'm simply trying to make the best
Of a difficult situation.
Well, you have a sick way of doing it.
[ dog barking ] [ vehicle approaches ]
Forgive me.
I've never had the privilege
Of an education or proper upbringing.
You're a beautiful woman.
Harris ryland is a bigger fool than i thought
For letting you get away.
Bobby ewing is here.
Excuse me.
[ barking continues ]
You understand that requesting to meet with me
And coming here alone, you've put yourself at my mercy.
Well, you seem like a nice enough fella.
Here.
I brought you something.
"railroads move the nation."
I can arrange -- one time only --
For you to move as much product as you want,
Much more than a fleet of ryland trucks can accommodate,
Between mexico and the u.S. By rail.
And what makes you think that your train
Would fare better than our trucks at the border?
The odds are worse.
One train only needs one nosy border patrol guard
To cost us the entire load.
The railroad commission will, at my request,
Run an emergency drill,
Effectively creating a massive diversion
In which the state of texas
Will officially vacate the populace
And shut down security on the rail for three hours,
Allowing a certain train to move freely and undetected
Between our countries, delivering all the product
The cartel ever wanted delivered to the u.S.
In one trip.
And you are being so helpful...
Because...?
Because i want my wife and stepdaughter back.
[ laughs ]
If i did that, i would have no leverage left.
What would stop you
From trying to undo our takeover of your company?
We already tried.
And all our best leads wound up being dead.
So, you can continue to hold the women if you want,
Or you can be smart and show your boss
That you were the one
Who could amass a giant fortune in one night.
[ sighs ]
So, do we have a deal?
Or do you have to call someone for approval?
Yes.
We have a deal.
But you only get to take back one of our guests with you.
The girl...
Or your wife?
Previously on "Dallas"...
Nicolas isn't working with Cliff.
He's going after the company himself.
- Is it done?
- Ewing Global is officially ours.
We don't have any evidence to stop these people.
I think I know someone who can help.
But it's the last person I want to go to for a favor.
If you don't use your contacts to help me prove that the cartel was behind the takeover,
I'll be forced to bring Candace out of hiding.
Once you take care of our Candace problem,
I will agree to increase the amount of product running through the pipeline by 25%.
Luis:
Those hands belong to your whore.
It's my gift to you to show you I'm a man of my word.
And this here is to make sure you keep yours.
Double the shipments immediately.
Or they're dead.
[Dog barking]
Oh!
[Barking continues]
[Speaking Spanish]
[Laughter]
[Man speaking Spanish]
Sit down.
Sit down and don't move.
[Gasps]
[Both gasp]
I'm sorry if your journey down was a bit rough.
[Grunts] But bringing you here was the only option I had to get Judith's attention.
You must be starving.
Can I get you something to drink or eat?
Just water, please.
Where do you think we are?
[Sniffles]
Mexico?
South Texas?
I don't know.
I am so sorry.
This is all my fault.
Let's stay strong, Emma.
Together, we're stronger than apart.
Have you accepted my demands?
It's all set.
Our trucks are on their way south.
Promise me that you'll have all the border people paid off.
Now that we're doing this,
I want it done as quickly as possible.
I can assure you, Judith, everyone involved in this transaction wants our product moved quickly.
Your loved ones, especially.
I'm keeping my end of the bargain, Luis, and I expect you to do the same because if something should happen to my granddaughter, trust me when I say you and everyone you love will die regretting it.
We'll be in touch, Judith.
[Sobs]
If those trucks get stopped at the border [voice breaking] and he does anything to hurt my Emma...
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Okay, we are doing exactly as they asked.
- They need those trucks.
- Mm.
Why don't you go upstairs and lie down?
[Grunts] Come on.
- I'll have your medication sent up.
- Mm-hmm.
Look, I've got this under control.
- You hear me?
- Mm.
Man:
Mr. Ryland, you have visitors.
Come on in.
[Door opens]
Harris, I need your help to contact the CIA.
The cartel has taken over Ewing Global.
Ewing Global isn't the only thing they've taken.
♪ ♪ Theme music plays ♪ ♪
Hey.
What is it?
Something's happened.
I need to explain because I love you.
And I need you to understand, okay?
Okay.
After you and your family moved to Texas,
I didn't stay in the catholic school.
I went back to the streets, Ellie.
You should've told us, Nicolas.
There were some boys dealing drugs.
Pretty soon, the boss of this gang, Orestes, noticed that I had a facility with numbers.
He told me that I was destined for great things.
[Scoffs]
And I believed him.
I was thrown in jail a few times.
But Orestes got me out.
He sent me to study in Europe to become educated, to become...
Nicolas Treviño.
Then Orestes started to change.
Mexico's drug trade wasn't enough for him.
He wanted to control the government, too.
I was desperate.
I was tied to a man who had become... a murderer.
Orestes knew I wanted out, so he made a deal with me.
If I could deliver the funds to buy the next national election,
I could be free.
In my eagerness, I overreached on an investment and I lost the cartel more than half a billion dollars.
And then you came back into my life.
Just like when we were children, you saved me.
What are you saying, Joaquin?
The Ewing Global deal.
Orestes forced me to take it for him.
Orestes' last name is Mendez-Ochoa.
He is the war criminal known as El Pozolero.
You used me to pay your debt to the Mendez-Ochoa cartel!
I am so sorry.
We need to tell the Ewings.
We need to tell the S.E.C. so they can fix this.
They can undo this.
We can't.
[Camera shutter clicking]
There's nothing we can do.
Please, listen to me.
Orestes threatened to kill my sons.
He threatened to kill you.
Hunter McKay set up the shell companies for the cartel.
He is dead.
They're tying up loose ends.
They want me to sell off all the divisions of the company so they can use the cash to influence the election.
Until then, we are both in danger.
You were the one person I thought I could trust.
[Camera shutter clicking]
But I never knew you at all.
You need rescue them now.
We need to find them first.
Then call in all your resources and find them.
Sue Ellen:
At least act like you give a damn.
I feel for you all.
I do.
I'm not unsympathetic to your situation.
I have a wife and a daughter, too.
And that is the only reason I'm telling you as much as I am about a classified CIA operation.
But locating and rescuing kidnapped U.S. citizens is not just an operational decision.
It's a diplomatic one, above my pay grade.
- Bullshit.
- Then call your boss.
I'll call Langley right away, ask if we can put some pressure on the Mexican government to accelerate a move against the cartel.
But I got to be honest.
I don't think Mexican authorities will authorize a move unless it gets them El Pozolero.
- Who?
- The head of the Mendez-Ochoa cartel.
He's been underground for the last four years, selling drugs, laundering money to liberate Mexico.
Both the Mexican government and the CIA believe catching him is the only way to stop a complete destabilization of the country.
I can appreciate what the CIA and the Mexican government are trying to accomplish.
But I refuse to allow my wife and her daughter to become collateral damage!
The cartel made it perfectly clear that if we don't start doubling our shipments immediately,
Ann and Emma are dead.
So you tell your bosses I'm moving those drugs with or without their protection.
Ryland?
What the hell are you doing here?
Why are you all here?
What's going on?
Emma's in this mess because of you, you little shit, pushing her to work against me!
[Sighs]
Ann and Emma were kidnapped by the Mendez-Ochoa cartel.
Ryland's not running drugs like Emma told you.
He was working with the CIA.
Bobby:
The cartel can't find out about Ryland and the CIA, or Ann and Emma will be killed.
So, how are you gonna find them?
It turns out a lieutenant in the cartel has them, a man named Luis.
We have two options of tracking him down...
Nicolas Treviño, Victor Des Lauriers.
Nicolas is inside man on the I.P.O.
Turns out they were both working together to steal the company for the cartel.
Christopher:
Finding either one of them could lead us to Luis.
And Ann and Emma.
I'll do what I can to track down Des Lauriers and Treviño.
But I won't be able to get your trucks any CIA protection at the border.
[Ryland scoffs]
I'm not gonna wait for the CIA to find Treviño.
I'm gonna find him myself.
How?
Lucia Treviño.
I bet she knows where her husband is.
Sue Ellen:
I'll contact Carlos.
He has contacts within the Mexican government and the federal police, too.
John Ross:
These guys aren't just drug lords.
They're businessmen.
Look, they took Ann and Emma because they wanted money.
- [Cellphone rings]
- Treviño offered them a deal.
Let's bring them a better one.
- Hello?
- And what would that be?
- What's going on?
- I don't know yet.
I'll figure it out.
Check with me before you do something, okay?
Thank you.
What's happening, Christopher?
That was the office.
Treviño just sold the consumer division at Ewing Global.
He's selling our assets at 70 cents on the dollar.
[Gasps]
With prices like that, the cartel will get the money they need quickly.
And once they get the money they need...
They won't need hostages.
Emma.
Hmm?
I'll be right back, okay?
Where are you going?
Just sit tight.
If there's a way out of here, I'm gonna try to find it.
Excuse me, señor?
May I go to the washroom, please?
Of course.
Diego will show you the way.
[Speaks Spanish]
Un momento, por favor.
[Dogs barking]
[Barking continues]
Hey.
After everything that happened,
I never thought I'd see you anywhere near Southfork again.
Well, I guess you were wrong, because here I am.
Why are you here?
My father's feud with the Ewings is over.
But mine is just beginning.
I'm staying here in this marriage until my idiot husband can figure out a way to get the company back.
And once he does,
I'm gonna take him for everything he's worth.
Look, I know you hate me, and I don't blame you.
But we got to set our feudings aside, Pamela.
Ann and Emma have been kidnapped by the Mendez-Ochoa cartel.
Oh, my God.
The cartel asked Ryland to push more drugs through the pipeline in exchange for Ann and Emma's freedom.
Christopher's tracking down Nicolas, and I'm gonna try to broker a deal between the cartel and Nasir.
You think Nasir's gonna want to do business with you again?
Your word means nothing to him.
You might be right.
But I have to try to convince him to trust me again.
Look, if I can get Nasir to lend me the money to buy the divisions the cartel's liquidating... [Sighs]
I may be able to make a deal for Ann and Emma's freedom.
Pamela, they are in danger.
I have to do something.
I could really use your help.
I need to unpack.
[Sighs]
[Door closes]
Lucia:
You shouldn't have come back to Mexico, Señor Ewing.
These parts have been very dangerous lately.
Rebels killing locals and tourists without discrimination.
Well, things have been very dangerous in Dallas as well, Señora Treviño.
That's why I'm here.
I know your husband's real name is Joaquin Reyes, and I know that he's in debt to the Mendez-Ochoa cartel.
The cartel threatened our family if my husband didn't repay his debt.
Nicolas is a good man.
He's a good father.
He was left with no other choice.
Would a good father who fears for his children's lives leave their side with things as dangerous as you have described?
The cartel has already killed one man involved in the Ewing Global takeover and has kidnapped two of my family members.
I need to find Nicolas because I think that he can lead us to them.
[Sighs]
Nicolas has run off with Elena Ramos.
Nicolas isn't putting your welfare at the top of his list.
He's holed up somewhere with Elena, and he won't come back for you, no matter what you tell yourself.
Please, let's help each other.
I'm sorry, Mr. Ewing.
[Sighs]
I'm not saying you're lying.
I just want to make sure he's getting my messages.
Look, what did he say when you told him I called?
Well, I'm sorry you had to hear that type of language.
[Footsteps approaching]
[Cellphone beeps]
Here to beat up on me some more?
Get in line.
I got people that hate me on every continent.
Was that Nasir?
Yeah.
He hates me, just like you said.
But he doesn't hate me.
What are you saying?
You and Emma...
It killed me, John Ross.
I believed in both of you.
But Ann...
I'll do anything to help her.
Even if it means helping you.
[Cellphone beeps]
[Telephone ringing]
[Cellphone rings]
Lucia?
Is everything all right with the boys?
Yes, as all right as things can be with you away.
Where are you, Nicolas?
I can't tell you that.
You know it wouldn't be safe for you and the boys to know where I am.
A bomb went off on the city bus today.
Eight people were killed.
I just don't feel safe here without you.
I've even stopped sending the kids to school.
When are you coming home?
I'm sending a plane for you and the boys immediately.
I want you to go back to the Costa Azul until this is over.
Orestes has possession of Ewing Global.
Your debt is paid.
What more does he want?
Things have gotten complicated.
Christopher Ewing was here looking for you.
He knows your real name.
He knows about your debt to the cartel.
And he said that you and Elena were together.
No, Christopher is manipulating you to get you to tell him where I am.
Elena is in a hotel in Dallas.
If Orestes finds me, I don't want Elena hurt anymore than I want you and the boys hurt.
Now, may I speak with my sons?
They're with the tutor.
I'll have them call you when they're done.
I know I lied.
I told her you weren't with me, but for good reason.
Lucia is a jealous and impulsive woman.
The last thing I need right now is for her to do something rash or stupid.
Be with your family, protect them.
It's too late for me and Lucia.
For now, I just need her and the boys to be safe.
I'm protecting them by making sure my debt is fully paid.
I love you, Elena.
And I hope someday you'll be able to forgive me...
For all the terrible things I've done.
[Sighs]
A proper drink for a proper lady.
[Grunts]
So...
You were married to Harris Ryland.
Yes.
A long time ago.
Hmm.
Well, I don't see him deserving you.
Perhaps he was more handsome with hair.
[Cellphone rings]
Ah.
Excuse me.
Sí.
Dígame.
¿Qué?
Imaldita sea!
No!
No!
No, please!
Stop!
No!
- No!
What happened?
- No!
No!
No!
Stop!
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!
Don't!
Mom!
[Both screaming]
Emma!
Emma!
[Cellphone rings]
Hello, Luis.
I just got a call from one of my men.
It seems your trucks have been stopped at the border.
Did you not think I was serious about my threat?
This is exactly what I was worried about in the first place.
Moving more trucks across the border always meant more risk.
I warned you this could happen.
But I can fix it, if you'll just give me a little more time.
And I warned you what would happen
- if you didn't do exactly as I asked.
- [Whimpers]
Say hello to your grandma.
[Voice breaking] I'm sorry, grandma.
This is... it's all my fault.
I'm so sorry.
[Gasps]
Oh, God, please don't do that.
[Cries]
I only need one hostage.
And at this moment, I have two.
Please don't do this.
[Gunshot]
Aah!
Emma!
Emma!
[Screaming]
[Crying]
Damn you!
Damn you!
No!
Habla con tu abuela.
I...
I'm okay.
Oh!
I'm okay.
Oh!
[Whimpers]
I want you to think about the emotion you just felt.
And then imagine feeling it every day for the rest of your life.
You have one day to get the trucks moving.
[Cellphone beeps]
She's okay.
Oh, my God.
Oh!
[Crying]
I thought I lost you.
[Sniffles] It's okay.
It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.
It's okay.
Shh.
That's what they thought, too.
Senator, we're talking about my wife and my stepdaughter, two Americans who are in trouble because the CIA is doing business with the cartel.
The government created this mess.
The government should clean it up... now, before innocent lives are lost.
Joe:
I wish there was something I could do, Bobby, but our government is weighing the lives of two citizens against the security of an entire nation.
I know there's something you can do, Joe.
You're a United States senator, for God's sake.
I'll talk to my colleagues on the intelligence committee.
- But other than that, my hands are tied.
- [Sighs]
The longer they're there, they...
[Sighs]
Things are escalating, Sue Ellen.
Look at this.
Man:
Riots broke out again today in the streets of Mexico City in response to the murder of yet another federal magistrate.
Many believe the killings are part of a plan by the Mendez-Ochoa cartel to consolidate power in their bid to influence the upcoming presidential election.
I should be doing more.
My sister-in-law, Sue Ellen Ewing, made me aware of a near breach of one of our gas pipelines.
Leaks happen almost every day.
Even with expedited repairs, an explosion could happen at any time.
With so many lives at risk in South Texas,
I'm proposing we do something about it now.
Well, there is no doubt that gas-pipeline safety is an important part of the railroad commission's purview, but the emergency drill that you're proposing, Bobby, would involve large-scale evacuations.
We would have to clear train tracks for miles on both sides of the border.
I'm aware of that.
Tests like that don't come cheap, especially on such short notice.
And I'm aware of that.
But cost and inconvenience is a small price to pay for human lives.
That's why I'm proposing we do this emergency training exercise with our Mexican counterparts so that crews on both sides of the border can be well-prepared in case of a gas-pipeline leak.
It's that simple.
I'm gonna step outside.
You two discuss it, and then, uh, we'll take it to a vote.
How did it go?
Well, I'm counting on their instinct for self-preservation to guide their conscience.
You do realize what will happen if you get caught.
Well, since I don't have immunity from the CIA and I'm going against their wishes to bring a trainload of drugs across the border,
I'm guessing there'll be a little jail time.
Federal prison.
For the rest of your life.
If it helps bring Ann and Emma back, it's worth every day of it.
The last time you were here, Mr. and Mrs. Ewing, you assured me and my father that you would make good on J.R.'s pledge to include our family in your plans for the Arctic leases, leases that we are not allowed to bid on as foreigners.
And once again, the Ewings failed to make good on their word.
My husband failed to make good on his word.
I was raised to believe that a wife should support her husband.
I was here last time as just that, a wife.
But today I'm here as a businesswoman, your highness, and my word is my bond.
That is the only reason I agreed to this meeting, Mrs. Ewing, because I take you as a woman of integrity, a word foreign to your husband.
Nobody knows that better than I do.
When I married, half of everything I owned became my husband's, including my shares in Barnes global, the company my father founded.
Indeed.
It was your dowry.
I trusted my husband when he assured me that we would have controlling interest in the company.
But, instead, he lost it all, his family's legacy and mine.
Dishonorable and inept, a most unfortunate combination in a businessman.
I'm here, your highness, because I believe that my family's loss might be your family's gain.
How so?
The Mendez-Ochoa cartel bought the shares of Ewing Global with drug money.
Now they're selling off all the divisions at 70 cents on the dollar.
These are blue-chip divisions we're talking about... timber, mining, media, insurance.
If we were to offer, say, 75 cents on the dollar,
I believe we'd be able to buy it all back in one fell swoop.
Why would I lend you an exorbitant amount of money to get in business with criminals?
John Ross:
Because the methane technology is among the assets Ewing Global has for sale.
Once we buy them back, I'll be able to bid on the Arctic leases off the Alaskan coast, as only an American company can.
Seeing as your family's reserves are gonna be dry within five years,
I have a feeling you're gonna be thirsty for that sweet Arctic crude.
I'm intrigued, of course, but skeptical.
I've been burned by the Ewings before.
But never by a Barnes.
I find your loyalty to your family admirable, Mrs. Ewing.
Ms. Barnes.
Better yet, Pamela.
You don't have much time, Your Highness.
A day maybe.
Nasir, Pamela.
I hear sincerity in your voice, and I see integrity in your eyes.
I will speak to my father right away and let you know what we decide.
I'm not sure exactly how you pulled it off, Ewing, but you're a lucky man to have such a wife.
[Lucia speaking Spanish]
Arriba.
[Sighs]
Gracias.
[Sighs] Someone will meet you at the landing strip and take you to Luis.
I told him you would solve our transit problem.
[Vehicle door opens]
Emma... is all I have.
Thank you.
That's how I feel about Ann.
Bring them home safe.
We have a deal.
The sheik has agreed to give us the loan.
Thank you for pulling off the impossible, Pamela.
You're amazing.
I did it for Ann.
And I did it for my legacy.
Nothing's changed between us, John Ross.
Christopher:
I'm surprised to hear you were at the gate.
After this morning...
In Latin America, the family means everything, Mr. Ewing.
Nothing can be allowed to interfere with the sanctity of the family.
Even infidelity can't tarnish that sanctity.
So, we give our husbands room to indulge their impulses, with the unspoken understanding that our loyalty ends the moment the family becomes subservient to the mistress.
My family has been threatened, and my husband has made a choice to break our family.
Do you know where he is?
Yes.
I know more about my husband than he realizes.
Do you think that daddy will move the trucks in time?
Your father will do everything in his power to save us.
I know that.
[Sighs]
Ann, would you like to join me for dinner?
Do I have a choice?
Not really.
Sit down.
Please, eat.
[Chuckles]
I'm glad you like it.
My secret is using the freshest ingredients.
The boy from the farm down the road brings me fresh vegetables every day.
2:00 sharp.
Sometimes I let him sample my cooking.
Of course, I'm not the cook El Pozolero is.
But I can make a few dishes like this pozole, a hearty Mexican stew.
I believe I've lost my appetite.
Oh, you must've heard about my boss, El Pozolero, and how he got his nickname.
Dissolving the remains of his victims in a stew of acid.
Ahh.
An exaggeration, I can assure you.
Emma and I are your hostages.
We're already at your mercy.
Do you need to terrorize us, too?
I'm sorry.
It's not my intention to terrorize you.
I'm simply trying to make the best of a difficult situation.
Well, you have a sick way of doing it.
[Dog barking]
[Vehicle approaches]
Forgive me.
I've never had the privilege of an education or proper upbringing.
You're a beautiful woman.
Harris Ryland is a bigger fool than I thought for letting you get away.
Bobby Ewing is here.
Excuse me.
[Barking continues]
You understand that requesting to meet with me and coming here alone, you've put yourself at my mercy.
Well, you seem like a nice enough fella.
Here.
I brought you something.
"Railroads move the nation."
I can arrange... one time only... for you to move as much product as you want, much more than a fleet of Ryland trucks can accommodate, between Mexico and the U.S. by rail.
And what makes you think that your train would fare better than our trucks at the border?
The odds are worse.
One train only needs one nosy border patrol guard to cost us the entire load.
The railroad commission will, at my request, run an emergency drill, effectively creating a massive diversion in which the state of Texas will officially vacate the populace and shut down security on the rail for three hours,
allowing a certain train to move freely and undetected between our countries, delivering all the product the cartel ever wanted delivered to the U.S.
in one trip.
And you are being so helpful... because... ?
Because I want my wife and stepdaughter back.
[Laughs]
If I did that, I would have no leverage left.
What would stop you from trying to undo our takeover of your company?
We already tried.
And all our best leads wound up being dead.
So, you can continue to hold the women if you want, or you can be smart and show your boss that you were the one who could amass a giant fortune in one night.
[Sighs]
So, do we have a deal?
Or do you have to call someone for approval?
Yes.
We have a deal.
But you only get to take back one of our guests with you.
The girl... or your wife?
Mm!
Oh, God, that is so hot.
- Aw, yeah.
- (coughs)
Something's wrong with the heater thingy.
I keep telling people.
That water's coming out, like, lawsuit hot.
Thanks, Devin.
You ever think of telling people that before they drink?
Nah.
You know, I'm in the legal department, and we kind of need the work.
Ever since they fired Susan the sexual harasser,
- things have been slow.
- Yeah.
It was a lot more fun with Susan around.
- (laughs)
- Ray:
Hey, Nate.
Remember when you set me up with that blind date with Janice's ugly cousin?
Now we're even.
Hey, uh, Miller.
Ray says he's busy Friday night, but, uh, he mentioned that you don't have any plans.
You and I are gonna party.
I need another tomcat to go tomcatting with.
(laughs)
Sir, I-I'd love to go tomcatting.
I mean, who doesn't, these days?
But don't you have a wife?
(chuckles) Divorce.
Dang Job came between us.
Hmm.
Dang Job is the name of the acupuncturist she was sleeping with.
Come on, you and me, Friday night.
Huh?
Give me some skin, baby.
Out of sight.
I-I'll come by, I'll pick you up at, uh, 7:30.
Uh, you know, I could do 7:00 if you want to teach me some new dance moves or, indeed, some bedroom tactics that people are doing now.
I'm an old dog, but I can learn new tricks, baby.
Ray, how could you do this to me, man?
Janice's cousin wasn't that ugly.
She just had a gap-toothed smile.
Come on, it was more gap than tooth.
She ate a whole breadstick without opening her mouth.
Hey, you know, Miller, you know, something... something's really bugging me, and I need to get it... out in the open before we go out tonight.
You see, when I-I slap tens with someone,
I need to slide it off, you know, real cool, like...
I mean...
I mean, the chicks...
they-they really dig that.
And I think we need to practice before tonight.
So, uh, come on.
Give me the palms.
Now you feel that, huh?
Huh?
Groovy, right?
- Very-very groovy, sir.
- Okay, now you.
Come on, you.
Come on.
Give it a whirl.
Come on.
Slow down.
Where you going?
Where you go...
Whoa-whoa, whoa.
Attaboy.
You know, if you two are sleeping together,
I'm gonna need you to fill out some paperwork.
So what?
Your boss wants you to be his wingman, big deal.
Yeah, I can't go to a bar and pick up women with a man in his 60s.
He said he needs to stop on the way and pick up a compression sock.
Not entirely sure it's for his feet.
I'll be honest, I don't see anything weird about this, either.
Yeah.
Says the guy who made cheese from his wife's breast milk.
Breast milk is the number one super food.
I didn't need to wear my glasses that whole year.
I'm gonna go throw up.
Look, I'd love to cancel, but I can't snub my own boss.
All right, so go out with him once and make sure he never wants to do it again.
Just give him the old South Side Mall treatment.
Ugh.
The South Side Mall.
That place is the worst.
It's hot, it's dirty, and it has the saddest merry-go-round.
Those horses just stare out with dead eyes, saying,
"When will it end?"
Yeah, exactly.
You go once and you never want to go back.
It's what we do when Mikayla brings home a friend we don't like.
We just turn the house into the South Side Mall.
Yup.
We crank the heat, blast Bjork, close all the windows and steam some broccoli.
What do you want him to do, make himself look bad in front of his boss?
He can't do that.
Yeah, she's right.
I mean, it's impossible for me to be unlikeable.
Believe me, I've tried.
We were in high school,
I ruined A Christmas Carol with my Scrooge.
Director said he'd never seen a crowd turn against Tiny Tim before.
Look, you can ditch someone and still have them like you.
You just have to pass them off on someone else.
I did it all the time when I was teaching.
Remember Ms. Parker and Coach Deborah?
I pawned them off on each other and that turned out beautifully.
Yeah, didn't you sing at their civil union a few years ago?
I rewrote the lyrics and sang
"It's Raining Women."
Look, I'd love to pawn Ed off on someone he has something more in common with.
But the problem is I don't know any single 60-year-old losers who are in desperate need of companionship.
My bee friends are gone.
The hive collapsed, the queen left.
And the whole colony followed her without so much as a good-bye.
I got to go check on my ant hills.
God forbid they left me, too.
If they did, someone better be ready to take me out for ice cream.
Oh, come on, well, that's just too easy.
Oh, I don't know if he's gonna go for Dad.
I mean, Mr. Dolan's a sophisticated executive.
Dad gets mistaken for the cart collector at the grocery store.
He's got to stop wearing that red vest and start remembering where he parked his car.
Hey, come on, Tom must have some social skills.
He used to be regional vice president.
I mean, somehow he managed to climb the corporate ladder.
He didn't climb.
I put a hand under each butt cheek and shoved him up that ladder.
Nathan:
Wait.
So you're saying that you know how to make Dad look good?
Sure.
It took me a whole marriage to figure it out, but I learned how to dress him and how to steer him toward his best jokes.
It's basically the technique that Jim Henson used to turn a pig into a movie star.
You know what?
This plan could work.
All right, so I'll-I'll tell Dad, and then we'll figure out how to switch it up.
No, Tom's the puppet.
You can't tell the puppet you're pulling the strings.
He'll try to move on his own and get tangled.
You know, if Mom could sell Ed on Dad, you would be the son of the boss's buddy.
That is not a bad thing.
Yeah, that's true.
It could be perfect.
I mean, I'd be...
I'd be close enough that he'd want to promote me, but not so close that he'd want to try out his pickup lines on me.
"Nice legs.
What time do they open?"
(laughing)
My God!
(laughing):
What he said...
Oh, God!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
That would totally work on me.
You know, when someone gives you a gift, it's polite to use it.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
My sock is tight.
Nathan, Nathan!
Oh, gosh, my divorced parents are here.
What are the chances?
Wow, Nate, what are you doing here?
I was about to ask you the same question.
Uh, Dad, you know my boss Ed Dolan.
Hey, Ed.
How are you?
Hello, hello.
Oh, your mom said the Andersons wanted to meet up here and talk to us.
I hope they're not gonna ask us to swing again.
I told them the last time,
I don't even like to share my popcorn.
Right.
Um, well, Ed, why don't you have a seat here and I'll get us some drinks, and if the Andersons don't show up, we'll just take these seats.
Okay, great.
So sorry to hear about your divorce.
- Oh, thank you.
- But you know what Tom says.
Marriage is like a three-ring circus.
Engagement ring, wedding ring and...?
Suffering.
(laughter)
That's good.
Very good.
This guy's got a million of them!
Tell him the one about the old couple
- having sex on a farm.
- Oh, yeah.
This is good.
Nice legs.
What time they open?
(chuckles)
So that-at works on my sister.
I...
Not-not that I've tried ion her.
Hurry, your dad's in the middle of the farm joke.
So, the old couple is making love up against the same fence, arms flailing, they're screaming.
And the old lady says to him,
"You didn't do it to me like that 50 years ago."
And the elderly husband says,
"Well, 50 years ago, the fence wasn't electric"
(both laughing)
So, are you set with a believable excuse to leave early?
Yeah. (clears throat)
I'm actually getting a little help on that.
Which should be here in three, two, one...
Nathan, I totally had the date wrong!
My sister's getting married tonight!
- Tonight?
!
- Tonight!
- But I don't have my...
- Tux... it's in the car!
- But I'm here with...
- Ed...
I know!
Ed, we got to go.
I'm so sorry.
So sorry, Ed.
I'll make it up to you.
I'll make it up to you right now.
Give it me low and slow.
Ooh.
Slow ten.
Groovy.
(laughs)
Speaking of weddings, Tom, tell him the time you saw the drunk wedding photographer in the emergency room.
(laughs):
Oh, that's a good one!
It all started with me, my cousin and a donkey who could do math.
Ooh, I-I love donkey stories.
Well, strap in, mister, I got six.
(door closes)
(music playing quietly)
(music stops)
Mom.
Mom?
What time is it?
Oh, Mom, what are you...?
Oh, naked mother!
Naked mother!
Please put lots of clothes on and meet me downstairs.
You know, your son shouldn't have to see you like that.
This is why babies come out crying.
(groans)
I'm so hungover.
Say what you will about alcoholics, but they're brave to face every morning like this.
Sleeping with my boss?
What happened to our plan?
What happened to Dad?
Please tell me he's not upstairs with the Andersons.
Your dad got too drunk.
We had to put him in a cab after he peed in his fedora.
And then?
And then,
Ed asked me if I wanted to share a cab, and when the driver asked where we were headed, he said, "Bonetown."
I'm sorry, Nathan, but that's where we went.
We went to Bonetown.
(sighs)
Please tell me you made a pit stop in Rubberville.
You think I'm happy about this?
Do you know how stressful it is to sleep with a bald man?
You have to keep opening your eyes to make sure you're kissing his head and not his ass.
Look, Mom, you slept with my boss... a man that I'm trying to move out of my personal life, not into my mother's bed.
And on her floor.
And a little on this couch.
What?
!
Oh, God, this couldn't get any worse.
Wait.
Think about this.
Maybe this isn't a bad thing.
How?
He clearly felt as awkward as I do, because he snuck out without even saying good-bye.
You know what?
Maybe you're right.
Nobody wants to hang out with the son of their one-night stand.
If Ed is gonna try to avoid you, then he's gonna avoid me, too.
You actually just might've fixed this.
- You're welcome.
- (sighs)
What a relief.
All right, let's just try to erase this whole thing from our minds and pretend it never happened.
I'm gonna go upstairs and call Crate Barrel, see how soon they can get a new couch in here.
Oh.
Darn it.
You're awake.
I-I wanted to be there when you... when you opened your eyes.
This is what you would have seen.
Hey, you.
Ed, I thought you left.
Well, I did.
I went to get some, uh, some things.
I, uh...
I want to cook us breakfast, and I want to eat a hard-boiled egg on every spot we made sweet love last night.
I got a dozen... they wouldn't sell me just three.
What?
Oh!
Uh, Nathan.
I didn't, uh, see you there.
Uh, we need to have a talk.
Okay.
All right, uh, this is how it is.
(clears throat)
You ever heard of a place called Bonetown?
Ugh, God.
I can't believe you're telling us
Mom had sex with your boss.
You know, some things you keep to yourself.
It's-it's like you had flu in your house and you just... you came over and you sneezed in my mouth.
Why would you trick me?
I thought Ed and I were getting along great.
And when he gets those flowers I sent him, tell him I want them back!
And ask him not to read the card.
What's the big problem here?
So your mom and your boss had sex.
My mom and the mailman had sex, and it didn't change our relationship one bit.
Except I had to deliver the mail while he had sex with my mom.
Look, the problem is it's not just sex.
Ed wants to take Mom to his beach condo this weekend.
He-he wants to turn this into a serious relationship.
Not gonna happen.
I can't be with a bald man.
That's the lowest of the low.
If hair doesn't want to be on top of him, why would I?
Okay, why don't you just tell him you're not interested?
No, no, look, Debbie, she can't dump my boss.
He'll get upset ship me off to some radio station.
And this is not a face for radio.
This is a face that can sell beer, with a voice that can sell cars, all wrapped inside a body that can sell just about anything you use in the shower.
Wait.
What if Carol gets Ed to break up with her?
Yes.
Right.
Give him the old South Side Mall treatment.
Won't work.
He's already been to my mall, and he shopped till he dropped.
The man likes him some Carol.
He likes first-date Carol.
You got to give him the full Carol!
Show him the stuff I had to live with.
Like what?
Like why don't you wear that giant striped bathrobe that makes you look like you're being tented for termites.
Oh, wait.
I know.
Just slurp your soup in front of him.
(laughter)
I don't slurp.
(laughter) Sure.
And you don't scream like the Hulk when you have night terrors.
(mock screams)
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Why don't you show him your Sunday night beauty routine.
She wears so many beauty products at once, she looks like...
- You?
- Hey.
We're making fun of Mom, not me.
Right, right.
Okay.
Oh, no, I know what to do.
I know what to do.
Just do that thing where the back of your throat itches and you press in your ear and you make that goose noise.
- (honking)
- Yeah.
(honking)
Fine, fine.
You want me to be the South Side Mall,
I'll be the South Side Mall.
But I can't guarantee it'll make Ed stop liking me.
This... is a hard habit to break.
I went cold turkey and I'm fine!
Well... here we are.
Oh, good.
There's a couch for you to sleep on.
Seriously?
I know we got off to a quick start, but no more sex for a while.
I'm a lady.
This trip is going to be about mental intercourse.
But... this suitcase is mostly condoms.
I'll be ready to go to the beach in an hour or so.
Well, we're probably gonna miss the sunset, but, uh... no problem.
♪ ♪
Are you here with me or the Internet?
(slurping loudly)
(electric buzzing)
I'm doing this for you, you know.
Thank you.
(snoring)
(Carol screaming)
(slurping loudly)
Don't talk to me till I've had coffee.
All right.
Let me just...
What did I say?
!
(slurping loudly)
See?
You look so much more manly with hair.
Hmm.
Well...
Better than the spaghetti.
(slurping loudly)
(moans)
(clears throat)
Soup makes my throat itch.
(honking)
Oh!
Hey!
How was your weekend?
Good?
Your mom is amazing.
It is so great to finally meet a woman let's it all hang out and cuts through that... that phony new relationship BS.
Can you believe we rode home in silence?
That is so refreshing!
Ed, my other bag isn't gonna just walk in here from the car by itself.
You see?
She tells me exactly what she needs.
Move it, jackass!
That's the stuff!
What did you do?
!
Everything I was supposed to.
All the things you complained about and tons extra.
I told you, this was a hard habit to break.
He didn't mind the way that you slurp soup?
No, he smiled and said he'd like to see what I could do to a chowder.
I can't believe that he put up with all that.
I know.
He's the most patient, good-humored, accepting man I've ever met.
I don't know how to get rid of him.
Well, then maybe you shouldn't.
What do you mean?
Well... do you like him, Mom?
Well, he's-he's kind and very funny.
You should see his impression of you looking in the mirror.
(laughs)
(mumbling)
(laughs)
He totally captures your spirit.
Oh, I can't date your boss.
What if it goes sour or I break his heart?
It could hurt your career.
Look, Mom, yes, I'd like to be an anchorman someday, but not as much as I'd like to see you find somebody that makes you happy.
And who has a house that you could eventually move into.
This has a big, big upside for me.
But he's bald.
So what if he's bald?
This guy saw the worst parts of you, things that only your family knows about, and he's cool with it.
I think you can put up with a little shine on his noggin.
He's a good man.
And it's kind of nice to know he'll never give me lice.
Okay.
Here's the, uh... here's the last one.
(exhales)
Well, okay.
I'm, uh, gonna be heading out now.
I'm gonna see a plastic surgeon about all those problem areas you circled on me.
Wait, wait.
You had a long drive.
Um... why don't you sit down.
- Oh.
Oh.
- Yeah.
I'll...
I'll make you a drink.
Well, that would be...
that would be lovely.
Uh, as long as it's not a problem with... (mumbling)
(laughing)
Just a little speed bump on the way to Bonetown.
Hey, Miller, I think I got flowers from your mom.
Wait a...
Wait a minute, these are from your dad.
Oh, you know what?
Here, let me just...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
"Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm sorry I peed in your fedora."
Why don't you just give me those, and we'll pretend it never happened.
Mm!
Oh, God, that is so hot.
Aw, yeah.
Something's wrong with the heater thingy.
I keep telling people.
That water's coming out, like, lawsuit hot.
Thanks, Devin.
You ever think of telling people that before they drink?
Nah.
You know, I'm in the legal department, and we kind of need the work.
Ever since they fired Susan the sexual harasser,
- things have been slow.
- Yeah.
It was a lot more fun with Susan around.
Hey, Nate.
Remember when you set me up with that blind date with Janice's ugly cousin?
Now we're even.
Hey, uh, Miller.
Ray says he's busy Friday night, but, uh, he mentioned that you don't have any plans.
You and I are gonna party.
I need another tomcat to go tomcatting with.
Sir, I-I'd love to go tomcatting.
I mean, who doesn't, these days?
But don't you have a wife?
Divorce.
Dang Job came between us.
Hmm.
Dang Job is the name of the acupuncturist she was sleeping with.
Come on, you and me, Friday night.
Huh?
Give me some skin, baby.
Out of sight.
I-I'll come by, I'll pick you up at, uh, 7:30.
Uh, you know, I could do 7:00 if you want to teach me some new dance moves or, indeed, some bedroom tactics that people are doing now.
I'm an old dog, but I can learn new tricks, baby.
Ray, how could you do this to me, man?
Janice's cousin wasn't that ugly.
She just had a gap-toothed smile.
Come on, it was more gap than tooth.
She ate a whole breadstick without opening her mouth.
Hey, you know, Miller, you know, something... something's really bugging me, and I need to get it... out in the open before we go out tonight.
You see, when I-I slap tens with someone,
I need to slide it off, you know, real cool, like...
I mean...
I mean, the chicks...
they-they really dig that.
And I think we need to practice before tonight.
So, uh, come on.
Give me the palms.
Now you feel that, huh?
Huh?
Groovy, right?
- Very-very groovy, sir.
- Okay, now you.
Come on, you.
Come on.
Give it a whirl.
Come on.
Slow down.
Where you going?
Where you go...
Whoa-whoa, whoa.
Attaboy.
You know, if you two are sleeping together,
I'm gonna need you to fill out some paperwork.
So what?
Your boss wants you to be his wingman, big deal.
Yeah, I can't go to a bar and pick up women with a man in his 60s.
He said he needs to stop on the way and pick up a compression sock.
Not entirely sure it's for his feet.
I'll be honest, I don't see anything weird about this, either.
Yeah.
Says the guy who made cheese from his wife's breast milk.
Breast milk is the number one super food.
I didn't need to wear my glasses that whole year.
I'm gonna go throw up.
Look, I'd love to cancel, but I can't snub my own boss.
All right, so go out with him once and make sure he never wants to do it again.
Just give him the old South Side Mall treatment.
Ugh.
The South Side Mall.
That place is the worst.
It's hot, it's dirty, and it has the saddest merry-go-round.
Those horses just stare out with dead eyes, saying,
"When will it end?"
Yeah, exactly.
You go once and you never want to go back.
It's what we do when Mikayla brings home a friend we don't like.
We just turn the house into the South Side Mall.
Yup.
We crank the heat, blast Bjork, close all the windows and steam some broccoli.
What do you want him to do, make himself look bad in front of his boss?
He can't do that.
Yeah, she's right.
I mean, it's impossible for me to be unlikeable.
Believe me, I've tried.
We were in high school,
I ruined A Christmas Carol with my Scrooge.
Director said he'd never seen a crowd turn against Tiny Tim before.
Look, you can ditch someone and still have them like you.
You just have to pass them off on someone else.
I did it all the time when I was teaching.
Remember Ms. Parker and Coach Deborah?
I pawned them off on each other and that turned out beautifully.
Yeah, didn't you sing at their civil union a few years ago?
I rewrote the lyrics and sang
"It's Raining Women."
Look, I'd love to pawn Ed off on someone he has something more in common with.
But the problem is I don't know any single 60-year-old losers who are in desperate need of companionship.
My bee friends are gone.
The hive collapsed, the queen left.
And the whole colony followed her without so much as a good-bye.
I got to go check on my ant hills.
God forbid they left me, too.
If they did, someone better be ready to take me out for ice cream.
Oh, come on, well, that's just too easy.
Oh, I don't know if he's gonna go for Dad.
I mean, Mr. Dolan's a sophisticated executive.
Dad gets mistaken for the cart collector at the grocery store.
He's got to stop wearing that red vest and start remembering where he parked his car.
Hey, come on, Tom must have some social skills.
He used to be regional vice president.
I mean, somehow he managed to climb the corporate ladder.
He didn't climb.
I put a hand under each butt cheek and shoved him up that ladder.
Wait.
So you're saying that you know how to make Dad look good?
Sure.
It took me a whole marriage to figure it out, but I learned how to dress him and how to steer him toward his best jokes.
It's basically the technique that Jim Henson used to turn a pig into a movie star.
You know what?
This plan could work.
All right, so I'll-I'll tell Dad, and then we'll figure out how to switch it up.
No, Tom's the puppet.
You can't tell the puppet you're pulling the strings.
He'll try to move on his own and get tangled.
You know, if Mom could sell Ed on Dad, you would be the son of the boss's buddy.
That is not a bad thing.
Yeah, that's true.
It could be perfect.
I mean, I'd be...
I'd be close enough that he'd want to promote me, but not so close that he'd want to try out his pickup lines on me.
"Nice legs.
What time do they open?"
My God!
What he said...
Oh, God!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
That would totally work on me.
You know, when someone gives you a gift, it's polite to use it.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
My sock is tight.
Nathan, Nathan!
Oh, gosh, my divorced parents are here.
What are the chances?
Wow, Nate, what are you doing here?
I was about to ask you the same question.
Uh, Dad, you know my boss Ed Dolan.
Hey, Ed.
How are you?
Hello, hello.
Oh, your mom said the Andersons wanted to meet up here and talk to us.
I hope they're not gonna ask us to swing again.
I told them the last time,
I don't even like to share my popcorn.
Right.
Um, well, Ed, why don't you have a seat here and I'll get us some drinks, and if the Andersons don't show up, we'll just take these seats.
Okay, great.
So sorry to hear about your divorce.
- Oh, thank you.
- But you know what Tom says.
Marriage is like a three-ring circus.
Engagement ring, wedding ring and...?
Suffering.
That's good.
Very good.
This guy's got a million of them!
Tell him the one about the old couple
- having sex on a farm.
- Oh, yeah.
This is good.
Nice legs.
What time they open?
So that-at works on my sister.
I...
Not-not that I've tried ion her.
Hurry, your dad's in the middle of the farm joke.
So, the old couple is making love up against the same fence, arms flailing, they're screaming.
And the old lady says to him,

Just a little speed bump on the way to Bonetown.
Hey, Miller, I think I got flowers from your mom.
Wait a...
Wait a minute, these are from your dad.
Oh, you know what?
Here, let me just...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
"Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm sorry I peed in your fedora."
Why don't you just give me those, and we'll pretend it never happened.
A lot of big, things happened in 1991... the Soviet Union collapsed, pee wee Herman was arrested, for something I do every day... see you later... and I tried to learn the guitar.
♪ More than words ♪
♪ Is all you have to do to make it real ♪
To, uh, have the whole thing.
Did you need something,
Huh?
Yeah.
Maybe music, isn't your thing.
I could get better, what if I'm, like, the next Slash?
Statistically, most guitarists end up penniless and addicted to heroin.
Look, you're great at...
lots of other things.
Like what?
Well, like, uh, baseball... and, um...
Let me borrow this.
Morning, sweetie.
Morning.
My school's homecoming dance was a week away.
I was nervous about asking Heather Blumeyer.
Dad didn't give a crap.
Honey, Heather would have, to be blind to say no to you, you know what?
She still would say "yes,"
because you smell great, and your... and your face feels handsome.
Mom...
I get what you're doing.
I'm begging you... please stop.
No, I'm on a roll.
Jack, you asked out plenty of girls before we got married.
Granted, they were all hideous skanks.
Give him some tips.
Walk up to her and ask her.
It's not that easy.
Then don't ask her.
I bet she's gonna ask you because you're so hot.
Sounds like you could go to homecoming with your mom.
Obviously, he's joking.
But if we did, we would have an amazing time.
Kill me,
I thought you were going into the pool.
I changed my mind.
There's something gross floating in it.
Hey, Rach.
This baby's a 2-seater.
Ugh!
What's that on your hand, it's a stamp from the concert we told her not to go to.
My dad always steamrolled me, but with Rachel, it was a fair fight.
All right.
No car for the next month.
Fine.
Doug will drive me around.
- And no TV.
- Fine.
I'll just get smarter.
And no...
Fine.
Fine, fine.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine,
Oh, I will defeat her.
Mom didn't laugh for long because thanks to her study group, law school was bleeding into weekends.
Okay, so our test will definitely cover personal jurisdiction.
Ohh.
Oh, are you two together?
Yeah, he's my man.
Aw.
I'm so glad to hear that because I don't have a lot in common with the single students.
You know, they just... they just seem to... okay, and now you're making out.
I'm not sure this is the most appropriate place for that.
I need some adult friends.
I need to find a good punishment for Rachel.
Okay, me first.
Whenever I'm at home, I'm with kids.
I go to law school, more stupid kids.
Why do you need friends?
I don't ever want to be around anyone but you.
Mm-hmm, and our children.
I stand by my original statement.
All right, look.
Now that we fixed your stuff, here's what I'm thinking about Rachel's punishment.
In the war, the Vietcong used to...
Yeah, I'm gonna stop you right there.
With Rachel, all you need to do is find something, she really hates.
Has anyone ever told you you could be a model?
Yes!
Now get away from me.
It's been you all along, hasn't it?
Who's excited about having Rachel take over carpool duties for the week?
I am.
Yep.
And, George, I'm gonna, have to ask you to always sit shotgun.
- You can count on me, sir.
- No.
- I know I can, Dad, seriously?
Five days of watching George perv on my sister?
Five days?
Are you nerds still going to school on Fridays?
Please don't make me do this.
He stares at me with his mouth open.
You know, Rachel, there are times we have to do things we don't want to do.
But sometimes we get to make people do things they don't want to do, and it's those times that make life worth living.
Have a nice ride,
- Answer me this.
- Hmm?
What car are you using to get to work today?
Because I need mine to get to class.
Am I not a man?
Do I not have legs?
You're gonna run to work?
Bye-bye.
I'll see you around 7:00, good luck.
In high school, your best chance to ask someone out is the two minutes between classes.
And people were pairing up left and right.
Do you want to go to homecoming with me?
Totally.
I needed to find Heather A.S.A.P.
Jackpot!
Crap, it's Chad... the world's most obvious narc.
Hey, Frankie...
You know where I can score some reefer?
Damn it, Chad!
I know.
I want to smoke it!
Unfortunately, I didn't see Heather again until the end of the day.
Heather!
- Hey.
- Hi.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah, of course.
Um...
Okay, here's the thing.
Hey, is that your dad?
Oh, my God.
What's happening?
Hi, Dr. Dunlevy.
Hey, Frankie's friend.
Did you need something?
Too winded to run the last couple of miles.
I thought I'd hitch a ride home with you and Rach.
Mind if I hit that?
Well, my ride's here.
Were you gonna ask me something?
Suddenly, it just didn't see, like the right time.
Do you know what they're serving for lunch tomorrow?
I think it's turkey potpie.
Nice.
That the girl?
Yes.
Oh!
Swing and a miss.
You know what?
This drink energized me.
I think I can make it.
Patient prescribed 50 milligrams of mercaptopurine.
What were you thinking?
!
You want to turn down the volume and try that again?
You ran up like a crazy person just as I was gonna ask Heather to homecoming.
It was the perfect time.
Perfect time?
This is not a shuttle launch, there's nothing to be scared of.
You do know that fear is just an evolutionary response designed to keep you safe, from predators and not 16-year-old girls.
Yay!
Let's have a long conversation about how I'm dumb with girls because of science.
Well, it's actually, a short one.
It's all about adolescent hormones.
Now, I'm assuming that you get erections all the time for no apparent reason, am I right?
Ding, ding, ding.
Couldn't have been more right about that.
Just run, honey.
Remember I was saying that I wanted to make new grown-up friends?
Well, I made one today at the supermarket.
Mm.
Her name is Gail.
She has a great smile.
We both love gnocchi and Cary Grant movies.
Honey, that's not a friend, a friend is someone, you call after you wake up covered, in someone else's blood.
Well, I think Gail would be great in that situation.
I told her and her husband that we'd have dinner with them tomorrow night.
You're gonna love him.
He also treats cancer.
What kind?
Uh, all kinds... cat, dog, horse.
He's a vet.
You are not a doctor if your job used to be done, by a shotgun.
Trust me, Jack.
You're gonna love the...
Donkenhoffer... stursens.
You don't even know, their name, do you, don't care.
We're gonna have fun.
Why didn't you get out in front with Frankie and Mikey?
Because my class is closer to the parking lot.
After I get out, you need to wait at least, 30 seconds, okay?
- Hi, Rachel.
- Hi!
Thanks for the ride, baby girl.
'Sup, playas?
If you're looking for Heather, you're not gonna find her.
Why not?
Her and her friend, are skipping school, and going to Peach Lake.
I heard some guys, talking about it while I was flushing an M-80 down the toilet.
Well, I don't know, dude.
I've never ditched before.
I'm not really much of a rule-breaker.
Yeah, me either.
Look, you want to talk to Heather?
Don't be a wuss.
George is gonna cover for us.
- John Donovan, Here!
Frankie Dunlevy?
Here!
- Honey.
- Hmm?
What do you think about this blazer for dinner with, uh, Gail and the dog doctor?
Hold it up a little bit.
Yeah, no.
I don't think it's gonna go well with the, uh, sweat pants and that couch I'm gonna be sitting on over there.
I'm not going.
Okay, except that you are.
Look, when you were stuck, all day in the house with the kids, I went to all these hell nights because you needed it.
But now I'm on dumb-dumb patrol, and I don't need it.
So what are you saying?
I don't have to do that, anymore.
- Really?
- Yeah.
All right.
Late for work, gotta go.
See ya.
I will defeat him.
Hey.
Anyone got any marijuana cigarettes we can blaze?
Chad, are you wearing, a wedding ring?
What?
No.
Whoa, check it out.
The rope's still up.
If you can swing off of it and land in the lake, you're a legend.
Mike Vessallo was the last person to try it.
Landed on the rocks.
That guy's a badass.
Eats through a tube now, bro.
Frankie?
Hey, Heather.
What are you doing here?
Um, just skipping class, 'cause, you know, it's... it's kinda my thing.
Actually, Frankie came down here for something else.
Dude.
I should have just asked her to the dance right then and there.
But instead,
I went with a slightly less-terrifying option.
Dude, what the hell am I doing?
Going out on top, bro.
There are moments in life when legends are made.
This was not one of them.
Aah!
Uhh!
Brutal.
Here comes the Principal, run!
Yeah, I'll keep you updated, Gord.
I mean, Principal McMullen,
I'm in deep trouble for all the drugs I've been doing.
Mr. Dunlevy, one of your parents is here to pick you up.
Oh, God, please be mom.
Howdy, Chief.
I was suspended a day for the rope incident and it was going to suck.
Mom...
Please don't make me go to work with him.
Frankie, I'm sorry, but I have classes all day.
Besides, suspension's, not supposed to be fun.
I'll do anything.
I'll take you to homecoming.
I'm no one's backup, Frankie.
Okay, let's hit it!
- All right.
- Okay.
- Here we go.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye, honey.
Bye, baby.
Why aren't we getting, in the car?
It's a bad day to wear jeans, chief.
Try to keep up.
Really,
- Just got a call, chief.
Double-time it!
- Ugh!
Get out...
Both of you.
Thanks again, baby girl.
Uh-oh.
You better cover your nads.
Enough with the "baby girls" and "sweethearts."
Do you know why I'm even driving you?
Because my dad wanted to punish me.
He knows I think you're weird, creepy, and you smell like pickles.
Actually, that's me.
I had pickles this morning.
Hey, honey, please tell me you remembered to record that 3-hour "Nova" special on black holes.
Oh, I did, but I decided not to do it.
What... what, why... why?
Well, I just realized that I was only watching the stupid shows because you enjoyed them after a day of work.
But, like you said, our roles have changed.
So...
I don't have to do that anymore.
Oh, okay, okay.
Do I have to remind you, Joanne, this is a special.
It-it's never gonna be on the air again.
Well, I don't care, 'cause I think space sucks.
I think it's boring and it sucks.
Bye.
What the hell took you so long?
This... is so stupid.
We own two cars.
You know, I think you've lost the privilege of using the word "stupid," when you decided to skip class and risk breaking your neck all because you couldn't ask a girl to a dance.
So...
I would have already asked her if you hadn't shown up in front of my school, and taken the world's, weirdest water break.
Who does that?
So if not for me, this would have been a layup.
Oh, my goodness.
Well...
I apologize for getting in the way of you and your giant balls.
Here's the phone.
Give her a call.
Ask her out now.
Or I'll be back in four hours.
Here's a magazine.
Read it.
It's got photos of naked women.
They've all got tumors.
Uh!
Don't leave this office.
I was sick of my dad not giving a crap about my problems.
So I ignored him and left his office, 'cause I do what I want.
Frankie, I need your help.
Frankie, I need your help.
I'm short on nurses.
Get in here.
I'm losing him.
W-w-what do you want me to do?
I need you to apply direct pressure right here.
Here?
Aah!
[Screams
That's what you get for leaving my office.
Okay, so the elements of false imprisonment are...
I hope Zack and I get married.
But I don't know.
Right now, we're having a ton of sex, and it's really romantic.
Well, how can it not be, in a men's room?
I'm sorry.
Continue.
I think we're both worried that it's not gonna stay that way forever.
Well, it's not.
It gets better.
For real?
Yes, because eventually, you stop worrying about whether you're gonna make it.
You just know.
And no disagreement, about money, faith, or going to a lovely dinner with someone who treat, cat cancer is gonna jeopardize that.
Because at the end of the day, you know your partner's gonna step up and put, your happiness first.
You guys will be fine.
You've been together, what..
A year?
Two and a half weeks.
Okay, I'm done with you.
I'm sorry to do that to you, Frankie, but I needed a good laugh.
That's the best medicine.
Right, doc?
No, penicillin is.
In your case, it's chemotherapy.
When am I gonna be finished with all of this, Jack?
All right, here's the deal... if tomorrow's tests look good, you're done.
All right.
You're not the only pretty girl at the dance.
I'll see you in a bit.
You stay here.
So...
Who you taking to the dance?
He told you about that?
I was getting a catheter put in.
It seemed like a welcome distraction.
I didn't even know my dad thought about that stuff.
You got a girl in mind?
Well, actually, there's a...
I don't know why I opened up to him in that moment.
Maybe it was because he asked.
He's like, yeah, give me your... stupid energy drink.
Either way...
It was just nice to have somebody to talk to about it.
I know I was harsh on George, but he was asking for it,
I mean, he was acting, like we were dating.
So you think people believe that?
Ew!
No!
Of course not.
I'm me.
But all that crap you said to him, that's gonna follow him around school.
You know, because you're you.
Are you gonna be a bitch about me eating pickles in here?
Test results for the patient Carl Powell show an aggressive resurgence, of malignant cells in the prostate and surrounding tissue...
You talking about Carl?
Yeah,
Is he okay?
He's not responding, to treatment.
But he... he will, right?
Yeah, because that's how it usually works... treatment fails, and the patient gets better.
The, uh, likelihood of stopping the spread is less than 2%.
I'd seen that look on my dad's face many times.
But this was the first time, I knew what it meant... he was hurting.
Dealing with people living and dying all day made my girl problems not seem that important.
I guess I just wanted to cheer him up.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
I'm sorry, I got in trouble and you had to leave work, to come get me.
Ah, you're 15.
I'm 16.
Really?
You're gonna bust my chops about that right now?
Look...
You're a kid.
You're supposed to do stupid stuff.
I'm supposed to tell you why it's stupid and make sure you don't do it again.
I'm not gonna bug you about, this Heather stuff anymore.
Who's Heather?
I'm kidding.
Listen...
My hallways are littered with people regretting the things they wish they had done.
So do me this one favor... next time you know you want something, stop thinking about it and just do it before it's too late.
Sometimes in life, you have to step out of your comfort zone.
That may involve swallowing, your pride for a moment.
Maybe I should just...
So you're not gonna call me, George?
Hmm?
Is that your move?
I knew you were a player.
I'm so hitting that.
No, you're not.
Sorry to hear about Carl.
Yeah.
Or realizing the help you wanted was yours to give.
I was thinking tonight we could watch the "Nova" tapes?
Well, I actually thought we'd go out with your friends.
But the hardest part is taking that first leap.
Heather, hey!
Um... will you be my date to homecoming?
Oh...
That's so sweet of you to ask.
But I can't.
What?
Someone else already asked me.

Do you know why I'm even driving you?
Because my dad wanted to punish me.
He knows I think you're weird, creepy, and you smell like pickles.
[Light laughter]
Actually, that's me.
I had pickles this morning.
[Scoff]
Hey, honey, please tell me you remembered to record that 3-hour "Nova" special on black holes.
Oh, I did, but I decided not to do it.
What... what, why... why?
Well, I just realized that I was only watching the stupid shows because you enjoyed them after a day of work.
But, like you said, our roles have changed.
So...
I don't have to do that anymore.
Oh, okay, okay.
Do I have to remind you, Joanne, this is a special.
It-it's never gonna be on the air again.
Well, I don't care, 'cause I think space sucks.
I think it's boring and it sucks.
- Bye.
- [Click, dial tone]
[Bangs door]
What the hell took you so long?
This... is so stupid. [Receiver clicks]
We own two cars.
You know, I think you've lost the privilege of using the word "stupid," when you decided to skip class and risk breaking your neck all because you couldn't ask a girl to a dance.
So...
I would have already asked her if you hadn't shown up in front of my school, and taken the world's, weirdest water break.
Who does that?
So if not for me, this would have been a layup.
Oh, my goodness.
Well...
I apologize for getting in the way of you and your giant balls.
Here's the phone.
Give her a call.
Ask her out now.
Or I'll be back in four hours.
Here's a magazine.
Read it.
It's got photos of naked women.
They've all got tumors.
Uh!
Don't leave this office.
[Magazine thuds]
I was sick of my dad not giving a crap about my problems.
So I ignored him and left his office, 'cause I do what I want.
[Monitor beeping steadily] Frankie, I need your help.
[Man chokes]
Frankie, I need your help.
I'm short on nurses.
Get in here.
I'm losing him.
W-w-what do you want me to do?
I need you to apply direct pressure right here.
Here?
Aah!
[Screams
[Laughing]
That's what you get for leaving my office.
Okay, so the elements of false imprisonment are...
I hope Zack and I get married.
But I don't know.
Right now, we're having a ton of sex, and it's really romantic.
Well, how can it not be, in a men's room?
I'm sorry.
Continue.
I think we're both worried that it's not gonna stay that way forever.
Well, it's not.
It gets better.
For real?
Yes, because eventually, you stop worrying about whether you're gonna make it.
You just know.
And no disagreement, about money, faith, or [Sighs] going to a lovely dinner with someone who treat, cat cancer is gonna jeopardize that.
Because at the end of the day, you know your partner's gonna step up and put, your happiness first.
You guys will be fine.
You've been together, what..
A year?
Two and a half weeks.
Okay, I'm done with you.
I'm sorry to do that to you, Frankie, but I needed a good laugh.
That's the best medicine.
Right, doc?
No, penicillin is.
In your case, it's chemotherapy.
When am I gonna be finished with all of this, Jack?
All right, here's the deal... if tomorrow's tests look good, you're done.
All right.
You're not the only pretty girl at the dance.
I'll see you in a bit.
You stay here.
So...
Who you taking to the dance?
He told you about that?
I was getting a catheter put in.
It seemed like a welcome distraction.
I didn't even know my dad thought about that stuff.
You got a girl in mind?
Well, actually, there's a...
I don't know why I opened up to him in that moment.
Maybe it was because he asked.
He's like, yeah, give me your... stupid energy drink.
Either way...
It was just nice to have somebody to talk to about it.
I know I was harsh on George, but he was asking for it,
I mean, he was acting, like we were dating.
So you think people believe that?
Ew!
No!
Of course not.
I'm me.
But all that crap you said to him, that's gonna follow him around school.
You know, because you're you.
[Plastic bag rustles]
Are you gonna be a bitch about me eating pickles in here?
Test results for the patient Carl Powell show an aggressive resurgence, of malignant cells in the prostate and surrounding tissue...
You talking about Carl?
[Click] Yeah,
Is he okay?
He's not responding, to treatment.
But he... he will, right?
Yeah, because that's how it usually works... treatment fails, and the patient gets better.
The, uh, likelihood of stopping the spread is less than 2%. [Click]
I'd seen that look on my dad's face many times.
But this was the first time, I knew what it meant... he was hurting.
Dealing with people living and dying all day made my girl problems not seem that important.
I guess I just wanted to cheer him up.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
[Sighs] I'm sorry, I got in trouble and you had to leave work, to come get me.
Ah, you're 15.
I'm 16.
Really?
You're gonna bust my chops about that right now?
Look...
You're a kid.
You're supposed to do stupid stuff.
I'm supposed to tell you why it's stupid and make sure you don't do it again.
I'm not gonna bug you about, this Heather stuff anymore.
Who's Heather?
I'm kidding.
- Listen...

My hallways are littered with people regretting the things they wish they had done.

Tessa:
Some say your wedding day is the most romantic day of your life.
But others would argue it's the day after your wedding.
[Smooches]
Good morning, Mrs. Lafrique.
Good morning, Mr. Mrs. Lafrique.
[Chuckles]
Ugh!
While it may be perfectly legal for you two to consummate this marriage as often as you like,
I doubt it's gonna get you to school on time.
[Vacuum whirring]
Oh!
Sorry, dear!
I'm behind on my hoovering!
Oh!
Are they consummating?
!
- Yeah.
- Aww.
- [Whirring stops]
- Does "consummating"
mean what I think it means?
Are they [Bleep]
That's what I thought it meant.
Okay, out!
All of you, out!
- Okay.
- So sensitive.
This is why people don't have their weddings on a school night.

Lisa and Malik's wedding was notable for another reason... it was the first school night in my
- [Barks] - whole, entire life that dad didn't come home.
You didn't actually think that you were gonna sneak in the back door unnoticed, did you?
Okay.
So, hello.
Good morning.
And, yes, you may have noticed that I'm wearing last night's clothes, but that's only because...
I don't really need you to paint the picture for me on this one, George, but thanks.
So, let me just say that the assumption you made is correct, and, yes, although Dallas and I s-spent the night visiting with one another...
"visiting"?
Is that what people your age call it?
It doesn't mean anything.
We're not... it... it was a one-time thing, okay?
We're all adults, and it was a totally harmless and unremarkable event.
It was a huge mistake!
Our lives are ruined!
Poor mommy.
I know how you feel.
My mouth almost hooked up with a piece of wedding cake, but, luckily, I pulled out at the last minute.
Dalia, why would I do such a stupid thing?
Because it was a wedding and you were alone and daddy Altman looks good in a suit and the scent of Jasmine was in the air and Jasmine makes you horny and "a different world" was a great show... and whatever happened to Jasmine guy?
... and you and daddy Altman were meant to be.
I will say...
The sex was amazing.
Whoo-hoo!
Shamwow, baby!
That's what I'm talking about!
Did you, uh, do it animal-style?
What does that mean?
I think...
It's with sautéed onions?
Okay.
Then, no.
No, we didn't.
But I will say, I needed that.
Dallas kind of rocked my world.
And we both totally know what it's like to get some good, good sex.
[Laughs] It's just like, "whoops!
I totally just had awesome sex all over the place."
[Chuckles]
You have children, so I know you've been with a woman, but I got to say...
It sounds like you haven't.
I will take that as a compliment.
Tessa:
Whoa, this says you guys are allowed to cheat off one another.
That... that can't be right.
No, it's true.
In addition to a bank account, married classmates can legally share a G.P.A.
And we also get to share a marriage locker.
[Gasps]
Look, sweetie, it's a double-wide!
- Wow, pretty sweet.
- Oh, we also decided to get a new joint e-mail account.
So, from now on, you can reach us both at there were 16 other
Open your eyes, Tessa.
Love is all around.
Lisa was right.
It seemed like wherever I looked, people had things going on in their lives.
Lisa and Malik had their new marriage to share,
George had a crazy wedding hookup, and my ex-boyfriend Ryan... had June.
Watching them dance at Lisa's wedding made that painfully obvious.
But me, I was done with love, and, for now, I just needed a way to occupy myself.
It's good to see you back at the club, George.
We've missed you.
Well, it's... it's... it's good to be here.
Thank you for inviting me.
Uh-oh!
[Chuckles]
[Singsong voice] Looks like someone ordered the sautéed onions.
[Chuckles]
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, nothing...
Dear.
It's good to see you, Dallas.
You're looking well.
You too, daddy.
Is this seat taken?
- Dallas, what are you doing?
- What do you mean?
Isn't this a little inappropriate?
How so?
George, could you pass the sugar, please?
Dallas:
Oh, I'll pass it.
[Ethereal music plays]
Fantasizing about Dallas had become a full-time job.
It's a problem.
I don't know what to do.
It's really interfering with my work.
Is it?
Maybe these designs are just... ahead of their time.
I, for one, would love a buttocks bonus room.
It's not even that I have feelings for Dallas or I want to get back together, but...
It's just that night.
I can't get it out of my head.
She's really under my skin, Fred.
You know, when I accidentally feel something,
I write a letter.
- A letter?
To who?
- To no one.
In one glorious letter, you get it all out.
Nothing is too taboo or risque.
And then, when the letter is writ, you tuck it away somewhere safe, and then you never read it or think about it or feel any of those feelings, ever again.
How many of these... 346.
I see.
Well, it's worth a shot.
Hey, hey, hey, and... and may I keep these?
I really want to try to sell Sheila on adding a breastfast nook.
With my best friend off nesting and no boyfriend to speak of,
I had no other choice but to find a new circle... a knitting circle.
I was the first girl in my town to straddle a bicycle seat.
- Wow!
Trailblazer.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, hey, George.
- Is that your brother?
- He's my dad.
He lets you call him "George"?
He tolerates it.
Gertrude:
Is he single?
Gertrude, knock it off!
What?
Just because I'm 80 doesn't mean I'm not... still horny.
[Laughter]
Uh...
Tessa, could I speak with you for a moment?
Um...
W-What the hell is that?
That's my quilting circle.
Aren't they a hoot?
Since when do you have a...
Quilting circle?
Ever since I found myself with no friends, activities, or a love life.
They're helping me quilt a wedding present for Lisa and Malik, and providing awesome stories and a super-cool hang.
Uh-huh.
Y-You don't... think they're a little old for you?
Pshaw!
Don't be ageist, George.
We're seniors.
[School bell rings]
[Indistinct conversations]
Tessa:
Hi, newlyweds.
- Hi.
- Hello. [Sighs]
Is something wrong?
Now that we're married, we decided that Malik should handle our finances and I should handle our social calendar.
Great.
Not great.
He's nickel-and-diming me.
I'm not nickel-and-diming you.
I-I'm just pointing out that your special-order vegan entrées cost three times what a normal person's meal does.
I am not a normal person!
I am an above-average person.
Or, I used to be, before your 2.4 G.P.A.
- dragged mine through the mud.
- [Cellphone vibrates]
Great.
Y-You forgot my grandmother's birthday.
We just merged calendars today!
- Which happens to be her birthday!
- Fine.
I'll send flowers.
You know who doesn't have any of these problems?
Esther, Kay, Gertrude, and Harriet.
All their husbands are dead... and buried.
Must be nice for them.
I can't wait to be dead.
Trust me.
For Lisa and Malik, the honeymoon was over, but I was in the best relationship of my life.
Come on, ladies.
Let's hit the road.
But it's still early.
[Chuckling] Oh, for you, maybe, but we're pretty tired, and we need to get home to take out our teeth and hair and eyeballs so we can relax.
Okay, that's cool, but you guys are coming back tomorrow, right?
Because I have the whole day clear.
We'll be here, Tessa, so climb off our jockstraps.
See ya.
Maybe I was being a little clingy, but my heart was in the right place.
Meanwhile, George struggled to make sense of what he was feeling.
Letter-writing didn't seem like the answer.
But songwriting did.
[Guitar playing]
And by morning, George had a song and I had...
Oh, dear.
[Ominous music plays]
Hi, gals.
Oh!
What the hell is this?
!
I have been up all night.
Isn't it great?
Your hand is bleeding.
Oh, yeah.
This... happened around 4:00 A.M.
My eyes aren't as sharp as my needles are.
That's an old person's joke.
A-And that's an eye-glass leash.
Even I don't wear one of those.
- Tessa, dear, this afghan is completed!
- [Gasps]
You're too young to be staying inside with a bunch of old biddies.
You should be out there, being groped by a young man in a pork-pie hat.
What?
!
No!
No, that sounds... terrible.
We don't need men.
The five of us are stitched together.
We're a... sewing sisterhood.
Sister, you must me mad!
T-There's not one of us here who wouldn't bag and sell the others just to feel it again.
Feel what again?
- Love.
- Moisture.
Anyhow, you've still got your original hips and knees.
You should be out there using them.
Yes.
Why don't you go on a date with Kay's grandson?
- Oh!
- He's around your age.
[Sighs]
I-If it's important to the sisterhood, yeah, I'll do it.
You're 30, right?
I'm 17.
Oh, Esther has one your age.
He's got freckles!
While the sisterhood tried to force me back onto the dating scene...
[Humming] George was still feeling the aftershocks of his one-night stand.
Between whose thighs?
Whoa.
What?
Whose thighs were you singing about just now?
[Chuckles] Was I singing?
Yes.
It was very sultry.
Oh.
Well, that's weird, because I-I didn't even realize I was singing.
Must have been... something I heard on the radio.
Sing it again.
I'll Shazam it.
I'm... actually, I'm...
I got to take care of some things.
No, I-I want to Shazam it, George.
Let me Shazam it.
Well, no, Sheila.
Why do you care?
George, I like to stay on top of what's current.
Monopoly time at the shays'.
I'm always the boot.
I have to be the boot.
And that's how I feel about the iron.
- The iron?
- And the newlyweds were finding the games they played before marriage...
Were no longer fun.
- The iron?
- Yeah, it's the best piece on the board!
[Laughs] The iron is?
Oh, my God.
I feel like I don't know you.
No one suspects the iron.
They discount it.
And, slowly, it irons its way to victory.
You sound like an idiot!
Okay, what's going on over there?
- Nothing!
Nothing, just...
- [Sighs] having a little marital dispute
- [clears throat] - over which game piece is the best.
- The iron.
- It is not the iron!
Fred:
So, Malik plays the iron, and Lisa's the boot.
What's the problem?
We can... do that?
Mm-hmm.
I just thought, since we were married...
We had to share everything.
[Laughs] Goodness, no!
Being married, you share less.
[Chuckles] When you're dating, it's all sunshine and breastfast rooms.
[Chuckles, clears throat]
But when you're married, you finally get to be who you really are, which, in Malik's case...
Is the worst piece on the whole board.
- Isn't that the thimble?
- Shut up, June.
Victor!
Sorry.
I thought we were all thinking it.
No, we were not all thinking it.
I was.
Fred and Sheila's advice came just in time.
As for George, the cure for what ailed him came from a less-expected source.
What's this?
Sign-up sheet for the open mic.
Open mic?
That is why you're here, isn't it?
I mean, you've been singing to yourself for the past 20 minutes.
U-Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Of course.
That's... that's why I'm here.
While George prepared to pour his heart out,
I tried to find space in mine for...
Arthur...
Well...
Esther's grandson.
That was fun.
- Oh!
- [Muffled] Oh.
I'm so sorry, Arthur.
You seem like a really nice boy.
I'm just going through a really heavy crafting period right now, and...
I don't have romantic feelings...
For anyone...
least of all, you.
Well...
I feel like you could have mentioned that a little earlier, before I wasted my Saturday night and 50 bucks.
I ordered a side salad.
You added chicken.
- [Door opens, closes]
- The truth was, I was more of an old lady than those old ladies were.
But, unlike them, I was fine with it, and I was home in time to organize my yarn.
[Indistinct conversations]
Before I start, I'd just like to thank the bartender for lending me his guitar.

Yeah, me neither.

While it may be perfectly legal for you two to consummate this marriage as often as you like,
I doubt it's gonna get you to school on time.
Oh!
Sorry, dear!
I'm behind on my hoovering!
Oh!
Are they consummating?
!
- Yeah.
- Aww.
Does "consummating"
mean what I think it means?
Are they...
That's what I thought it meant.
Okay, out!
All of you, out!
- Okay.
- So sensitive.
This is why people don't have their weddings on a school night.
Okay.
Lisa and Malik's wedding was notable for another reason... it was the first school night in my whole, entire life that dad didn't come home.
You didn't actually think that you were gonna sneak in the back door unnoticed, did you?
Okay.
So, hello.
Good morning.
And, yes, you may have noticed that I'm wearing last night's clothes, but that's only because...
I don't really need you to paint the picture for me on this one, George, but thanks.
So, let me just say that the assumption you made is correct, and, yes, although Dallas and I s-spent the night visiting with one another...
"visiting"?
Is that what people your age call it?
It doesn't mean anything.
We're not... it... it was a one-time thing, okay?
We're all adults, and it was a totally harmless and unremarkable event.
It was a huge mistake!
Our lives are ruined!
Poor mommy.
I know how you feel.
My mouth almost hooked up with a piece of wedding cake, but, luckily, I pulled out at the last minute.
Dalia, why would I do such a stupid thing?
Because it was a wedding and you were alone and daddy Altman looks good in a suit and the scent of Jasmine was in the air and Jasmine makes you horny and "a different world" was a great show... and whatever happened to Jasmine guy?
... and you and daddy Altman were meant to be.
I will say...
The sex was amazing.
Whoo-hoo!
Shamwow, baby!
That's what I'm talking about!
Did you, uh, do it animal-style?
What does that mean?
I think...
It's with sautéed onions?
Okay.
Then, no.
No, we didn't.
But I will say, I needed that.
Dallas kind of rocked my world.
And we both totally know what it's like to get some good, good sex.
It's just like, "whoops!
I totally just had awesome sex all over the place."
You have children, so I know you've been with a woman, but I got to say...
It sounds like you haven't.
I will take that as a compliment.
Whoa, this says you guys are allowed to cheat off one another.
That... that can't be right.
No, it's true.
In addition to a bank account, married classmates can legally share a G.P.A.
And we also get to share a marriage locker.
Look, sweetie, it's a double-wide!
- Wow, pretty sweet.
- Oh, we also decided to get a new joint e-mail account.
So, from now on, you can reach us both at there were 16 other
Open your eyes, Tessa.
Love is all around.
Lisa was right.
It seemed like wherever I looked, people had things going on in their lives.
Lisa and Malik had their new marriage to share,
George had a crazy wedding hookup, and my ex-boyfriend Ryan... had June.
Watching them dance at Lisa's wedding made that painfully obvious.
But me, I was done with love, and, for now, I just needed a way to occupy myself.
It's good to see you back at the club, George.
We've missed you.
Well, it's... it's... it's good to be here.
Thank you for inviting me.
Uh-oh!
Looks like someone ordered the sautéed onions.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, nothing...
Dear.
It's good to see you, Dallas.
You're looking well.
You too, daddy.
Is this seat taken?
- Dallas, what are you doing?
- What do you mean?
Isn't this a little inappropriate?
How so?
George, could you pass the sugar, please?
Oh, I'll pass it.
Fantasizing about Dallas had become a full-time job.
It's a problem.
I don't know what to do.
It's really interfering with my work.
Is it?
Maybe these designs are just... ahead of their time.
I, for one, would love a buttocks bonus room.
It's not even that I have feelings for Dallas or I want to get back together, but...
It's just that night.
I can't get it out of my head.
She's really under my skin, Fred.
You know, when I accidentally feel something,
I write a letter.
- A letter?
To who?
- To no one.
In one glorious letter, you get it all out.
Nothing is too taboo or risque.
And then, when the letter is writ, you tuck it away somewhere safe, and then you never read it or think about it or feel any of those feelings, ever again.
How many of these... 346.
I see.
Well, it's worth a shot.
Hey, hey, hey, and... and may I keep these?
I really want to try to sell Sheila on adding a breastfast nook.
With my best friend off nesting and no boyfriend to speak of,
I had no other choice but to find a new circle... a knitting circle.
I was the first girl in my town to straddle a bicycle seat.
- Wow!
Trailblazer.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, hey, George.
- Is that your brother?
- He's my dad.
He lets you call him "George"?
He tolerates it.
Is he single?
Gertrude, knock it off!
What?
Just because I'm 80 doesn't mean I'm not... still horny.
Uh...
Tessa, could I speak with you for a moment?
Um...
W-What the hell is that?
That's my quilting circle.
Aren't they a hoot?
Since when do you have a...
Quilting circle?
Ever since I found myself with no friends, activities, or a love life.
They're helping me quilt a wedding present for Lisa and Malik, and providing awesome stories and a super-cool hang.
Uh-huh.
Y-You don't... think they're a little old for you?
Pshaw!
Don't be ageist, George.
We're seniors.
Hi, newlyweds.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Is something wrong?
Now that we're married, we decided that Malik should handle our finances and I should handle our social calendar.
Great.
Not great.
He's nickel-and-diming me.
I'm not nickel-and-diming you.
I-I'm just pointing out that your special-order vegan entrées cost three times what a normal person's meal does.
I am not a normal person!
I am an above-average person.
Or, I used to be, before your 2.4 G.P.A.
dragged mine through the mud.
Great.
Y-You forgot my grandmother's birthday.
We just merged calendars today!
- Which happens to be her birthday!
- Fine.
I'll send flowers.
You know who doesn't have any of these problems?
Esther, Kay, Gertrude, and Harriet.
All their husbands are dead... and buried.
Must be nice for them.
I can't wait to be dead.
Trust me.
For Lisa and Malik, the honeymoon was over, but I was in the best relationship of my life.
Come on, ladies.
Let's hit the road.
But it's still early.
Oh, for you, maybe, but we're pretty tired, and we need to get home to take out our teeth and hair and eyeballs so we can relax.
Okay, that's cool, but you guys are coming back tomorrow, right?
Because I have the whole day clear.
We'll be here, Tessa, so climb off our jockstraps.
See ya.
Maybe I was being a little clingy, but my heart was in the right place.
Meanwhile, George struggled to make sense of what he was feeling.
Letter-writing didn't seem like the answer.
But songwriting did.
And by morning, George had a song and I had...
Oh, dear.
Hi, gals.
Oh!
What the hell is this?
!
I have been up all night.
Isn't it great?
Your hand is bleeding.
Oh, yeah.
This... happened around 4:00 A.M.
My eyes aren't as sharp as my needles are.
That's an old person's joke.
A-And that's an eye-glass leash.
Even I don't wear one of those.
Tessa, dear, this afghan is completed!
You're too young to be staying inside with a bunch of old biddies.
You should be out there, being groped by a young man in a pork-pie hat.
What?
!
No!
No, that sounds... terrible.
We don't need men.
The five of us are stitched together.
We're a... sewing sisterhood.
Sister, you must me mad!
T-There's not one of us here who wouldn't bag and sell the others just to feel it again.
Feel what again?
- Love.
- Moisture.
Anyhow, you've still got your original hips and knees.
You should be out there using them.
Yes.
Why don't you go on a date with Kay's grandson?
- Oh!
- He's around your age.
I-If it's important to the sisterhood, yeah, I'll do it.
You're 30, right?
I'm 17.
Oh, Esther has one your age.
He's got freckles!
While the sisterhood tried to force me back onto the dating scene...
George was still feeling the aftershocks of his one-night stand.
Between whose thighs?
Whoa.
What?
Whose thighs were you singing about just now?
Was I singing?
Yes.
It was very sultry.
Oh.
Well, that's weird, because I-I didn't even realize I was singing.
Must have been... something I heard on the radio.
Sing it again.
I'll Shazam it.
I'm... actually, I'm...
I got to take care of some things.
No, I-I want to Shazam it, George.
Let me Shazam it.
Well, no, Sheila.
Why do you care?
George, I like to stay on top of what's current.
Monopoly time at the shays'.
I'm always the boot.
I have to be the boot.
And that's how I feel about the iron.
- The iron?
- And the newlyweds were finding the games they played before marriage...
Were no longer fun.
- The iron?
- Yeah, it's the best piece on the board!
The iron is?
Oh, my God.
I feel like I don't know you.
No one suspects the iron.
They discount it.
And, slowly, it irons its way to victory.
You sound like an idiot!
Okay, what's going on over there?
Nothing!
Nothing, just... having a little marital dispute over which game piece is the best.
- The iron.
- It is not the iron!
So, Malik plays the iron, and Lisa's the boot.
What's the problem?
We can... do that?
Mm-hmm.
I just thought, since we were married...
We had to share everything.
Goodness, no!
Being married, you share less.
When you're dating, it's all sunshine and breastfast rooms.
But when you're married, you finally get to be who you really are, which, in Malik's case...
Is the worst piece on the whole board.
- Isn't that the thimble?
- Shut up, June.
Victor!
Sorry.
I thought we were all thinking it.
No, we were not all thinking it.
I was.
Fred and Sheila's advice came just in time.
As for George, the cure for what ailed him came from a less-expected source.
What's this?
Sign-up sheet for the open mic.
Open mic?
That is why you're here, isn't it?
I mean, you've been singing to yourself for the past 20 minutes.
U-Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Of course.
That's... that's why I'm here.
While George prepared to pour his heart out,
I tried to find space in mine for...
Arthur...
Well...
Esther's grandson.
That was fun.
- Oh!
- Oh.
I'm so sorry, Arthur.
You seem like a really nice boy.
I'm just going through a really heavy crafting period right now, and...
I don't have romantic feelings...
For anyone...
least of all, you.
Well...
I feel like you could have mentioned that a little earlier, before I wasted my Saturday night and 50 bucks.
I ordered a side salad.
You added chicken.
The truth was, I was more of an old lady than those old ladies were.
But, unlike them, I was fine with it, and I was home in time to organize my yarn.
Before I start, I'd just like to thank the bartender for lending me his guitar.
You guys like country music?
Yeah, me neither.

Thank you.
After a standing ovation and one encore,
George decided to visit the actual Dallas, who'd been waiting to hear what, if anything, that one night meant to him.
I didn't know if I should call, or not call.
Well, somehow, you managed to do both.
Right.
So, hey, ever since... the other night,
I just feel that everything has been flowing for me, creatively.
And I'm not mad at you anymore.
Not for any of it.
I know our hooking up was weird, but I honestly feel it freed me.
Well, great.
You're free.
what... did I... say something wrong?
No, but you didn't say anything right.
Look, for you, it might have been fun and freeing.
But for me...
It... it wasn't.
It's... it's messy.
And it shouldn't have happened.
Okay, come on.
Dallas, don't be like this.
Can't we just... be friends?
No offense, George, but being friends with you is about as much fun as being kicked in the gut by a donkey.
George didn't want a fight, but Dallas did.
She wanted George to fight for her, and I knew how she felt.
Heading back?
Yeah.
I got a big geology final this week.
If I don't figure out what that means pretty soon,
I'm gonna be in trouble.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Yeah.
It was good seeing you, too.
I'm glad this is so normal.
What?
Us.
I'm... glad that we can be friends.
It's nice.
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay, well I guess I'll see you... when you're... back in town for the holidays.
Actually, it looks like
I'm... gonna be in Vail this year with June and her family.
Oh.
I've never been away for the holidays before.
But I guess it'd be stupid to... pass it up.
I mean, it's Vail.
Yeah, it's Vail!
How could you pass that up?
Right.
That's what I was thinking.
Okay, well, uh...
Drive safe.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Be cool.
Be cool.
Tessa, dear.
That cut on your hand has opened up again.
Yeah, I know.
It's a hard place to put a band-aid.
It keeps falling off.
You know what I do when a band-aid won't stick?
I take a piece of tape, but, you know, the good kind, and you have to use your own...
And that's when I realized the cut on my hand wasn't the only injury.
Ryan was my wound that wouldn't heal.
And maybe, just maybe, he wasn't meant to.
There was a reason I'd been hiding behind my crochet needles, and that reason was Ryan Shay.
Even after all this time... there was still something between us.
June!
Can I get you a ginger ale?
MARY:
I never thought I'd struggle with telling good from evil.
But there was once a time when I lost that certainty... and everything I thought I knew was just a lie.
BELL TOLLS
One Autumn morning in 1821,
I set off alone to a place far away from everything I'd ever known.
I had no family left to me, except an aunt I'd met just once.
It was there I was headed, to the ends of the earth, to Bodmin Moor.
You need to find a husband to take care of you.
You should take Ned, love.
You know he'd see you right.
You always said if I married I should love the man.
Have you changed your mind?
Of course I haven't.
Well, then.
'My mother hid her illness from me.'
And her sudden death was more than I could bear.
Mary.
Marry me, Mary.
When she'd gone, my childhood sweetheart, Ned, did all he could to make me stay.
But I did not love him.
I thought I had no need of love.
And didn't know its power.
But as I was soon to learn, there's nothing so dangerous as a headstrong girl who knows her own mind.

How long will it take to change the horses?
I'm going to Jamaica Inn.
Jamaica Inn?
If it's work you're after, you won't find it out there.
I'm expected.
It's my uncle's inn.
Well, you can tell your uncle, Legassik says hello.
What's your name?
Mary.
It's rough out at Jamaica, Mary.
Coaches don't stop there any more.
Be that as it may, it's where I'm bound.
I'm not afraid of hardship.
It's just the moors for 20 miles.
Some say there's ghosts.
Not afraid of ghosts, either.
You're a bloody cheat!
What are you afraid of?
Get off me!
I saw you!
I saw you, you...cheat!
Come 'ere!
Come 'ere!
Get a hold of him, will you?

Oi!
Which one of you took my scuddlin' horse?

Will you take me to Jamaica Inn, then?
Or shall I have to walk?

What is it, Joss?
Only, I was just...
Aunt Patience.
Mary?
Oh, it's never you, is it?
Is my sister with you?
She's dead.
Dead?
A month ago.
I wrote to you.
Did you not get my letter?
No.
No.
She wanted me to come to you.
I've nowhere else to go.
No.
No.
No.
You can't stay here.
Course she can.
She can work for us.
Can't you, Mary?
She's a good girl.
You can see it in her face.
She'll be no trouble.
Well, that depends.
Is she tame?
Or does she bite?
Should've made this one a boy.
Joss...
Shut up!
Me and this girl, we understand each other.
You can get her something to eat.
She's starved to death.
You mustn't mind your uncle Joss.
There's none round here who don't respect him.
He brings me flowers, see?
Here, sit.
Brandy?
You don't drink, huh?
No?
I do.
I drink and I drink.
Sometimes, when I drink, I talk.
But if you ever get too nosy or open that trap of yours,
I'll break you... and make you eat out of my hand.

SHE SIGHS
You've seen how castaway we are.
I don't go out there.
Happy with my chicken run.
Aunt Patience, why are there no customers?
Your uncle doesn't like folk staying'.
Lonely spot like this, we could be murdered in our beds.
How can you live if there's no custom?
People come from all around, thank you very much.
Farm cottages and the mines.
It's evenings when the bar's full of 'em.
So, tell me, Mary... you got a beau back there at home?
No.
He'll be along soon enough.
A man to stop you thinking straight.
You'll be off to church before you know it.
I don't know that I want to marry.
Unless I really loved the man.
It seems to me too many men just make slaves of women.
You'll change your mind.
Course you will.
Your uncle says there's silk for sale at Camelford.
Lovely Chinese silk.
Goin' cheap as well.
Thought we could get down there an' make ourselves new dresses.
Is it smuggled silk?
Now, listen here, missy, your uncle's got another mouth to feed now so we can't go paying out for everything.
I'll starve then, if it helps you.
It was smugglers who killed my father, surely you know that?
So you can't go putting money in their pockets.
Fine.
Then I'll just wear this one till it falls off my back then, shall I?
Leave me naked to the four winds!
What do I care?
I brought this for you.
It isn't new.
Hasn't got any holes in it.
Thank you, love.
I suppose you think me dowdy.
No.
Course not.
You need to take care, Mary, love.
You've got to fit in round here.
I'd hate to see any harm come to you.
HORSE WHINNIES OUTSIDE
JOSS:
Come on!
Hey, come on!
Your uncle's out.
There's water to wash.
You should be careful.
A man might help himself to what's on offer, if it's so pretty.
It's not on offer.
If he's any kind of gentleman he'd know that.
Well, that told me.
And he wouldn't help himself to the ale, either.
The landlord here is a brutal man.
I know the landlord.
But take it, if it makes you feel better.
I only came to check you're all right.
A horse thief came to check that, did he?
That's all I am, is it?
A common horse thief?
A man who can't find an honest trade is no man at all, in my eyes.
What the hell do you want, Jem?
Is there trouble?
What...can't I come an' see my own brother?
Like my new trinket, do you?
Mine.
What do you want?
There's a new magistrate in Launceston, sent down...
Says he'll hunt down any man who's working the Free Trade.
You don't think I know about it?
Yeah, well, you should do something about it.
You need to stay quiet a while.
And how d'you expect me to do that when someone's squealing'?
What d'you mean?
Customs've been turning over half my bloody stash.
Now, someone's talking.
You heard anythin'?
No.
All the more reason to lay low.
We can't, we've got a haul coming off the coast tonight.
Need you to get me more horses.
And I said no.
No?
No, Joss.
I'm your brother!
You want to see me hang?
WHISPERING:
Mary!
Get away from there!
Aunt Patience.
No!
You could have told me you're his brother.
I thought you might have guessed it from my manners.
How long you plannin' on being here, Mary?
Seems a waste.
A maid like you.
You need to find a husband.
Everyone seems very keen to tell me what I need.
What I mean to say is... you shouldn't stay here.
There's things going on here you shouldn't get caught up in.
What, like smuggling?
I worked that one out.
I'm not stupid.
Well, you are if you say it so damn loudly.
Well, it's wrong.
I know the lies folk tell themselves... to make out it's no crime.
But that doesn't make it right.
If I had somewhere else to go, I would and I would take my aunt with me.
Mary, whatever it is you think you know, you mustn't speak of it.
Not if you want to stay safe.
Says the horse thief.
You might be right there.
Probably be the death of me one day.
Here...take that nag.
I brought her for you.
I don't want it.
Well, take her, anyway.
There might come a time you'd rather not be here, and if there is... you'll need her.

Joss's brother, Matthew, got himself caught up in one.

Huh?
You'd come here and play a man's game?
I can tell you what time we'll be along the coast.
I'll put the barrels over the side.
We'll split it 50/50.
Can't say no to that, eh, Joss?
Ain't up to you, old man.
Now, get out!
Cakey's knocked his ale over.
Needs it cleaning up.

I would never lie to you, Joss.
Never.
Never lie to you, Joss.
I would never betray you.
It wasn't me, I swear.
I told you.
I swear to thee on my mother's grave, I ain't no snitch, Joss!
Then how'd the Revenue know we were coming, hm?
Hm?
I had to cut Zephaniah out because I thought it was him who was snitchin'.
I don't have many other choices, Abe!
Their boys, they'll talk or they'll hang.
It wasn't me, I never did nothing.
Then who was it?
I don't know.
Why would you lie to me?
I wouldn't lie, Joss.
I swear I wouldn't lie.
Why would you lie to me?
I half believe him.
It's up to you.
MAN:
Do it.
I've known this man all my life.
He has a wife and child.
No, Joss!
No!
ABE GRUNTS AND CHOKES
ABE CHOKES
BODY SLUMPS DOWN
What do you want me to do with him?
DOOR SLAMS SHUT
Aunt Patience.
Please.
Your aunt's cooked breakfast.
Sit and eat.
We saved a spot of cream for your bread, too.
Joss, some more?
Good.
Aunt Patience, please, I need to talk to you.
That's it.
They brought a man in here last night.
Mary!
I know he was in here.
And I saw the rope.
I think that my uncle kill...
Do you need me, Joss?
No.
DOOR CLOSES
I was hiding in the storeroom.
A man came and he hid in there.
And I think they hung a man called Abe.
You must have had a dream and got confused.
But you were there and you heard them and...
I didn't dream your face.
Oh, this?
I did it to myself.
I tripped up on the cobbles outside and fell down on the water trough.
You saw me do it.
Mary?
Mary, where you going?
Mary!
We have to tell someone.
Tell 'em what?
There's nothing to tell 'cept what you dreamt.
Don't you come here making trouble for me, girl!
I'm trying to save you!
Can't you understand that?
I don't understand what kind of hold he has on you.
I know that you're afraid of him.
Course I am!
So should you be.
Least I've got your uncle to protect me.
It's the other man.
The one that hid.
He tells your uncle what to do.
He's the one that hit me.
Who is he?
Can't.
He'll kill me.
We have to put an end to this.
I'll tell them you're not involved.
Mary, you're not going to the law.
We feed you, don't we?
I'll send your uncle after you.
I'll send your uncle to fetch you back, Mary!
CHATTERING
Excuse me, is there a constable here?
Constable, eh?
There he is.
Eli Brown.
INDISTINCT CHATTING
I'm Francis Davey, the vicar of Altarnun.
I'm...
I'm Mary Yellan, sir.
Do you wish to speak with me, Mary?
Mr Davey?
You can't make stew inside a church!
My sister, Hannah.
Mary Yellan.
And Beth.
Who helps us at the vicarage.
Pleased to meet you.
Hannah, Mary wishes to speak with me so perhaps you and Beth might leave us alone.
Oh, no.
I'm just...
You're new to our Parish, Mary?
I'm at Jamaica Inn.
God's house is open to any who would hear his word.
Mr Davey?
WHISPERING
Jamaica Inn.
You're family, I suppose?
Hannah, Mrs Trelawn has need of me.
Abe didn't come home last night.
Drunk inside some inn, was he?
I hope we'll see you at a service, Mary.
Hear him preach.
He's very good.
You won't regret it.
Thank you for not saying anything.
I mean, it's not like it's so wrong bringing back a few kegs to sell.
SHE EXHALES
We're getting married.
I have to go.
Stop!
Stop!
Mary!
SQUELCHING
Don't struggle!
Get me out of here, please!
If you'd taken that nag I gave you she'd have kept you out of there.
Will you just...just get me out!
Here.
SHE GASPS
Didn't my brother tell you not to walk the moors alone?
I'm tried not to listen to a word your brother said.
He'd be right about that one.
Bogs are dangerous.
Like a lot of things around here.
Including you.
Me?
!
I thought I just saved your skin?
Ran me in, more like!
Skulking round on the moors, trying to scare me.
I know that you were there last night.
And I think that a man was murdered.
And murder would be wrong then, would it?
Course it's wrong!
And what if the law tells you to do it?
If you're a soldier and you go to fight the war, they tell you to kill plenty then.
So, that's your excuse, then, is it?
You've been to war so now you can do what you like?
No morals and no conscience?
Mary, there's things going on here you don't understand.
You need to be careful who you talk to.
So, where are you going now, then?
Launceston, is it, for the magistrate?
It's none of your business.
Yeah, well, you're heading the wrong way.
But the new magistrate's in Launceston.
Yeah.
But he rode past half an hour ago heading west.
And I'd say he was riding for Jamaica Inn.
Go.
You'll see.
And when you see I've told the truth, do me a favour.
Don't say you've seen me.
Please, Mary.
I'll come find you soon, Mary.
The magistrate has come!
Did you call him?
You, girl.
What's your business here?
Says she's Merlyn's niece.
BANGING AND CRASHING
WHISPERING:
Please, God, no.
Damn it!
Who told him I was coming?
I don't know what you mean, I...
You, girl.
What do you know of the dealings at this inn?
Nothing, sir.
I only came here a few days ago.
What about the landlord's brother, Jem?
Do you know where he is?
I've never met him.
You can tell Joss Merlyn I won't rest until I see him hang.
He has my word...on that.
HORSE WHINNIES
BANGING
Thank you, Mary.
You're my little lamb.
Cos my Jossey's a good man, see?
You're one of us now, Mary.
I lied to the magistrate.
I can't bear it on my conscience.
Mary might be our ears and eyes.
She could help us to investigate her uncle.
She should take care for her own skin.
Who's here?
!
SHE SCREAMS
Who knows what Merlyn's capable of?
I know there's another man gives my uncle orders.
Is it you?
What do you think?
You're a thief who stands for everything I despise.
And yet...you like me.
I do not like you.
I know it's always difficult to determine the value, but the share price is the share price, Mr. Karadeniz.
What we can do, I'm sure you'll appreciate this, is offer you a fair deal in terms of...
As I told Mr. Walden,
I'm not interested in profit participation.
WFG needs my shares.
I grant you, sir, your shares are important for our overall strategy...
Jason, your wife is calling.
How are you, Mr. Karadeniz?
I'm not selling for $18 a share.
Oh, I'm not negotiating this.
This is Jason's deal.
We just need to give him a couple of minutes.
Which way to the bedroom?
It's over there.
Wow.
I love the view.
So do I.
Mr. Karadeniz, how are you?
Am I interrupting something?
No.
No, it's okay.
We're just...
I can call later.
No, it's fine.
It's fine, I assure you.
Asshole.
Everybody's sucking your dick about the Karadeniz deal.
- Congratulations, you did it.
- Thank you.
I've got a real big one for you.
Sheikh Abdullah Nayed.
Estimated capital, 10 billion.
Wow.
Erik almost got him to invest a half a billion, but now he's about to sign with Horizon Capital.
I want you to take over.
Get him.
Just start with the small shareholders and work your way up.
Don't worry about that.
Just get it done.
Mr. Montgomery.
Mr. Smith.
Thank you for helping me arrange this.
Useless.
This is garbage.
Who the hell did you use?
No.
No, I need real in-depth research on the guy.
Fast.
Deal with it.
Mr. Montgomery.
The Sheikh will see you now.
According to our religion, feeding birds and treating them well is a good behavior,
identified with acquiring merit in the eyes of Allah.
And it was a pigeon that helped Muhammad when he escaped from the Quraish.
I'm telling you this because I know many people find it hard to believe that a Sheikh could be a passionate piggeon fancier.
Well, I heard Mike Tyson does it.
That's pretty hard to believe, too.
When I'm with my birds, I feel they bring the best out of me.
I'm sure this is also the case for Mr. Tyson.
I've already told Mr. Walden that I won't be investing in your company.
I like the sound they make.
Isn't it soothing?
Very.
Have you ever wondered why pigeons are the symbol of peace, of love and good will?
Every time I hold them in my hands and look into their eyes, it's as if I understand exactly why.
To care for them, to see these noble birds race, makes me the happiest man in the world.
How do you race pigeons?
Do they fly in circles?
No.
They fly in a straight line back to their loft.
The most fantastic race in the world is the Barcelona international.
The birds have to fly over 1,000 miles to get back home.
Can you imagine?
That's a long way for such a small bird.
Indeed.
It takes them two days to cover the distance.
The Barcelona race is the epitome of endurance, the synonym of willpower, a hymn to love.
Love?
Yes.
Because the birds fly home to the one they've left behind.
They want to be reunited as quickly as possible with the one they love.
It's my dream to win that race one day.
What does it take?
The right bird.
And you don't have it?
No.
A very, very stubborn man named Jos Pauwels has it.
We have offered him a huge amount of money, but he doesn't want to sell.
Why not?
I don't know.
Where is he, this Pauwels?
Flanders, in Belgium.
Have you heard of it?
An ancestor of mine supposedly died there in World War I.
But let me ask you a favor.
Let me prove to you that you can trust us with your investment.
Let me get you that bird.
I told you, it can't be done.
Even better.
Let me show you that with hard work and determination
WFG can do what can't be done.
I'm very close to signing with Horizon.
Then I'd better act fast.
...he used to be the village doctor.
The pigeon he's holding is the champion dove the Sheikh wants, Wittekop.
This is his granddaughter, Isabelle.
She's a student at the University of Ghent.
Her mother moved back to Holland, so now she lives with Jos.
It's raining.
Again.
Welcome to Belgium.
Mr. Montgomery, welcome to Belgium.
Didn't get the memo?
It's Mr. Evans.
I've found lodging in the village itself, as you requested.
Great.
But I have to warn you, it might not be very comfortable.
Because the place I found is not really a hotel.
- It's a...
A parsonage.
- What?
The local priest is renting out a room because the Church needs extra money, I suppose.
But I can book you a hotel in a city nearby.
Everything is very close in Belgium.
No, it's perfect.
I want to blend in.
Okay.
Here's your Belgian cell phone.
My number is in it in case you need anything.
Great, thanks.
Voila, this is it.
A very modest car, like you asked.
But we can change it, if you want.
No, it's perfect.
Turn back to the indicated road.
Yeah, yeah.
The indicated road is closed, wise guy.
Oh, what the fuck...
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Shit.
Excuse me.
Sorry, ma'am?
She's asleep, sir.
And without her hearing aid she's as deaf as a post.
Anna, Anna?
Time to go home.
Mass is finished.
See you tomorrow, Anna.
Good-bye.
She falls asleep every morning, before I even can reach the altar.
- You must be Colin Evans.
- Yeah.
Did you walk all the way from America?
My car got stuck in the mud a couple of miles back.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll send someone later to pull it out.
You know, I was raised by parents that considered the Americans as our saviors.
And that's why I'm so touched by you trying to find your ancestor's grave.
Because he died for my freedom.
I apologize for the mess.
I wanted to replace the old furniture with more modern things, but I didn't have the time to assemble everything.
Don't worry, I'll deduct it from the room rate.
It's IKEA.
Do you have IKEA in America?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
IKEA is everywhere.
It's like my boss.
The bathroom is across the hall, over there.
Dinner is at 7:00.
Today is chicken.
I've asked Martha, my housekeeper, to choose Cecile.
She's a nice, fat chick.
I mean Cecile.
Cecile is, not Martha.
Right.
See you tonight.
I was wondering, I couldn't find your Wi-Fi.
My what?
Your Internet connection.
Oh, no, no.
No Internet here.
No.
God is my provider.
Right.
I've selected a few books about the Great War for you from my library.
I know it sounds strange for a man in my position, but I'm very interested in war.
I don't know why.
But I'm sure you'll find them quite interesting and they could help you to locate your ancestor's grave.
Yeah.
Thank you.
All right.
I wonder, do you know in which battle he was killed?
No.
I only know it was in Flanders.
The American troops have never been here.
They landed in France.
He was English.
My great-grandmother moved to the US with her son after her husband was killed.
Oh, I see.
I was fearing you would think that Flanders was just a part of France.
Many people in the US make that mistake.
Yeah.
I'm a high school teacher.
So I'm not supposed to make those kind of mistakes.
Of course.
I should have known.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you very much, Martha.
Cecile, as beautiful in death as she was in life.
Good morning.
The...
He is in church.
Morning Mass.
I see.
- Eggs?
- Yes, please.
Is this decaf?
What?
It's like coffee, but without the caffeine.
We're honest people here, sir.
Oh, one's enough, thank you.
So, Martha, are you from around here?
Yes.
I've lived here all my life.
I know everyone.
So tell me, what do people do around here all day?
They work.
And when they're not working?
They...
They like football.
You know, with the feet.
They like...
TV.
They like...
I was wondering, is there a local pub around here somewhere?
Yes.
In De Zavelput.
It's three kilometers.
Say if you want more.
Hey, what's up?
Nice day today?
Let me help you.
That's okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What would you like to drink?
I'll have a Coke, please.
I'm Isabelle.
I'm Colin.
Colin Evans.
Yeah.
I know who you are.
Everyone in the village is already talking about you.
I only just got here.
Well, it's very easy to become a star in this town.
In the whole of Flanders, for that matter.
I thought you didn't understand English.
English, yes.
American, no.
He used to be my English teacher.
Yeah.
Until so-called "health problems" got me fired.
That's the weirdest pool table I ever saw.
It's very typical for Belgium.
It's a fun game, you know.
Really?
I'm actually pretty good at pool.
Oh, yeah?
Would you like to try?
Sure, I'd love to.
Do you want red or white?
Red.
Of course.
The color of aggression.
Pierre, leave him in peace.
And Coca-Cola.
So you line up the balls like this.
The game is very simple.
The one who first succeeds in pocketing his five balls in the opponent's pocket, wins.
We both start at the same time.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll count to three and then we shoot.
Ready?
One, two...
Wait, wait.
You first have to make a bet.
It's his first time, so let's forget about that.
No, no, I think we should.
I'll buy Pierre a beer every time I lose.
How about that?
Fantastic.
But I want you to have one, too.
Sorry, I don't drink alcohol this early in the day.
"Sorry, I don't drink alcohol so early in the day."
Fine.
I'll have one, too.
Okay, here goes.
One, two, three.
Nice shot.
Thanks.
So, do you work here full-time?
No, only during the summer.
I study biology at the university in Ghent.
What about you?
I'm a high school teacher.
That's why I have all summer to find that grave.
Yeah, I heard about that.
I think it's really great that you do this.
Well, family ties are important to me and my entire family.
One day, I want to be able to tell my kids where they came from so they might better understand where they're heading.
That's beautiful.
Two beers, please.
No mercy?
You don't look like the kind of guy that needs it.
A rematch after this one?
Why not?
Shall I walk you to the door?
No.
I'm fine, thank you.
Here, your keys.
No.
You keep the car.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You're still gonna help me find that grave, right?
Yeah.
I'm happy to help.
It's exciting.
- Sure you don't need help?
- Thank you.
I'm good.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hey.
Drink lots of water, okay?
Thank you.
That's very sound advice.
Come on.
- You're sure this is going to work?
- Yes.
But you must drink it all in one time.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How are you feeling?
Good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Wait, you still have...
- First time you're wearing this?
- Yeah.
- Well, it looks good on you.
- Thanks.
So what cemetery shall we go to first?
I don't know.
There's a lot of them, right?
Yeah, more than 100.
- Let's start with the biggest one.
- Okay.
So, where do we start?
These are really good.
You can't live in Belgium if you don't like French fries with mayonnaise.
Sure feels good to be out in the open.
This really reminds me of where I was born and raised.
Where was that?
Bearsville, New York.
It's near Woodstock.
Woodstock.
Wow.
Yeah, don't get too excited.
Nothing really happens there anymore.
Does your family still live there?
Yeah, but me and my dad, we...
He's always pushing me.
Ever since I was a kid.
It wears me out sometimes.
I hardly ever see my parents.
What?
Nothing.
It's just that
I thought you said family ties are really important to you.
They are.
They are.
It's just...
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to come across all gloomy.
Must be the country air messing with my head.
- Oh, God, is it 2:00 already?
- Ten past.
Shit.
I promised my granddad I'd join him at the club.
- The club?
What kind of club?
- A pigeon club.
- A what?
- He races pigeons.
He's really good at it.
I never knew you could race pigeons.
Well, it's a big sport around here.
Well, I'd love to see this.
Let's go.
Thank God.
I thought you wouldn't make it.
And I can't manage without my mascot.
He says I bring him luck.
Not that his birds need it.
So, you are the American?
I'm afraid I am.
Isabelle tells me you race pigeons.
Sounds very interesting.
Really?
Tell me, what's the thing that makes it interesting to you?
Just the whole concept, you know.
The whole concept?
- Jos, your turn.
- Okay.
Don't worry about my granddad.
He's always a bit overprotective when I...
You know, when he sees me with someone.
So he should be.
What are they doing?
Well, the pigeons all have a ring with all their data on it.
And that big guy over there, he scans the rings.
And from that moment on, the pigeons are officially in the race.
The birds are then put together in shipping crates and brought to the start of the race, which is,
Amiens.
That's in France.
How far is that from here?
About 200 kilometers.
Look.
That's Wittekop.
It's his favorite bird.
What happens next?
Tonight, trucks will take all the birds to Amiens.
And tomorrow, around 10:00 a.m., the birds will all be released at the same time.
Thousands of them.
The first one home wins.
A real champion dove can be worth a lot of money.
Up to 200,000 euros.
I'm sure your friend is not interested in the financial aspect of the sport.
Oh, I find it fascinating, sir.
I'd love to know more.
You should show him your loft.
Tomorrow I could make us a nice lunch.
We could all wait for the birds to return.
That'd be awesome.
Thank you.
I'm warning you.
It's boring.
He hates my guts.
He'll warm up to you.
You'll see.
So, are you ready for some more country air to mess with your head?
Sure.
This is a really beautiful spot.
I've lived here all my life.
But when my father died, my mom went back to Holland.
And I went to live with my granddad.
But the house is still ours.
I'd be heartbroken if anything would happen to this place.
Why would something happen to it?
Well, a while ago, there was this Belgian building company and they were planning on putting, like, a huge apartment complex here.
Luckily they ran out of financing, but...
I swear, I'd chain myself to a tree.
I'd do whatever it takes to save this place.
Why is it that everything beautiful has to be turned into a mall or a gas station?
Yes, David.
What have you got for me?
The construction company you're looking for is called Boulaert NV.
Where are they located?
Actually, not that far from you, in Bruges.
All right, set up a meeting with their CEO for tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.
And then book me on a flight to New York the day after.
You got it.
Are you coming to the party tonight?
What party?
It's to support our local marching band.
The whole village will be there.
You really should come, too.
Sure.
I'll be there.
Who's the guy in all the pictures with your grandfather?
That's my dad.
So he was a pigeon guy, too?
Oh, yes.
But Mom hated his pigeons because they shat on her laundry.
So he brought them here.
They've won a lot of races together.
The Barcelona Classic was their dream.
They'd just started to train birds specifically for that race,
but then he died.
In a car crash three years ago.
So is Jos coming home soon?
He is home.
He's in his loft.
Hey.
You ever hold a pigeon?
No.
This is Romeo.
How does that feel?
It's great.
It's great.
I can feel its heart.
It's racing.
Yeah.
It's because he doesn't know you.
You should talk to him.
What should I say?
Whatever you want.
Calm him down.
Hey, handsome.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you.
He likes you.
I will show you something.
What do I do with Romeo?
Put him back in his spot.
Look at this.
Take it.
So tiny.
Just into the world.
Pigeons grow very fast, you know.
In three months' time this baby will be ready to race.
You should give him a name.
- What, me?
- Yeah.
Maybe one day, he'll win a race for you.
All right.
Speed.
I'll call him Speed.
Okay.
From now on, whenever we see this bird fly, we'll think of you.
Wittekop?
That's fast, mate.
He's getting better by the day.
You think he's the first one?
Maybe, yeah.
We have to go to the club to see if he has won.
All right, let's go check.
Jos, last night, someone broke into Marcel's.
Yeah, all his pigeons are gone.
Good lord.
Is something wrong?
Marcel got robbed of all his pigeons.
It's horrible.
He spent a lifetime building those birds.
Marcel.
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
I'm Colin Montgomery from WFG.
I have an appointment with Mr. Boulaert.
Yes, Mr. Boulaert is expecting you.
Please follow me.
Colin?
If you see the...
You know.
The reverend?
Yes, reverend.
Can you tell him I already go to party?
Okay.
Will you come also?
I don't think so.
You must come.
Have some fun.
So you came.
I don't want to miss the number one party in Bunderzele, right?
Are you making fun of us, Mr. Evans?
Who's the singer?
I want to buy all her records.
Come on, big shot.
Show me how good you are on the dance floor.
Dear friends, I absolutely want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for showing up in such large numbers.
And I'd say, long live Bunderzele.
And now a golden oldie, a special request from our dear friend Martha.
The kissing dance.
What?
The kissing dance.
No, no, no.
No more dancing.
Oh, come on.
So what do we do?
We kiss.
Are you having fun?
Yeah.
Good.
Now you choose a girl.
Hey, what the fuck, man?
Let's rumble.
Leave her alone.
Idiot.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, it's just a little cut.
I haven't been in a fight since junior high.
You know, I was on my way to you when that guy stepped in.
Really?
Yeah.
Then you should finish what you started.
Wait.
Isn't this going to hurt?
I hope so.
Martha.
Hey, what's going on in there?
Come on, Martha.
Leave them be.
- No sex before the wedding.
- Come on.
Maybe I should go inside, too.
He's not going to get her up those stairs alone.
Do you want to meet up tomorrow?
After I get back from Ghent?
Yes.
Don't wreck my car, all right?
Thanks for letting me use it.
So I'll come and pick you up sometime after noon, okay?
Your lips are cold.
Bye.
Are you sitting down?
Yes.
The Sheikh just called.
Guess how much he's prepared to put in the fund?
Half a billion, right?
Two is more like it.
Wow.
The deal's going to make you very rich, my boy.
Now, you're on top of it, aren't you?
Sure, yes.
Get it done, get your ass on a plane.
Now, you're flying home tonight, right?
I...
Yes.
Good.
Shit.
I was just taking care of Speed.
Look how big he is, in just one day.
I didn't come here to talk about Speed.
I'm here on behalf of Sheikh Nayed.
Mr. Pauwels, I work for a very powerful financing group in New York.
The Sheikh is a client of ours.
You're wasting your time.
Wittekop is not for sale.
I know.
That's why yesterday afternoon I had a meeting with the CEO of Boulaert Construction Company in Bruges.
Our financing group intends to provide Bouiaert with the necessary funding they need to execute the plans they have for that beautiful nature spot near Isabelle's house.
You mean the Kleiputten?
Yes.
She's taken me there.
Believe me, I'd love to make sure that that site remains untouched.
But I can only do that if I can give my client what he wants.
I'll put 300,000 euros in your name in an ING bank account.
I don't want any money.
Nevertheless, it'll be there for you.
Always.
What if I told you to go fuck yourself?
Then I'd go ahead and break Isabelle's heart.
I would.
You know how much that place means to her?
She said she wouldn't let anyone touch it for as long as she lives.
And still you want to destroy it?
Let me put it this way, I wouldn't be standing here if I wasn't convinced that you love that girl more than anything in the world.
You...
You're a bastard.
That's why they pay me the big bucks.
Jos.
We're giving you a good deal here.
300,000 euros is a...
Shut up.
Shut up.
I...
I accept.
But I don't want Isabelle or anyone else to ever know.
I will tell them that the bird got lost during practice.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Sign here.
You had everything prepared?
Always.
Someone will pick up the bird later today when Isabelle's in Ghent.
Listen.
Here's my card.
Just in case.
Montgomery?
That's your real name?
Yes.
And that great-grandfather of yours?
Is he a lie, too?
No.
As a matter of fact, he isn't.
Well, then I feel very sorry for him.
Goodbye.
Please sign here.
Thank you.
Sir?
Excuse me, sir?
Do you want to take the call?
That was fun.
We should do this again someday soon.
Sure.
Bye.
Come on.
You know, we can't wait any longer, man.
We're gonna have to do it now.
It's your serve, David.
Look.
I've looked at the numbers and I'm saying we move now.
Are you going to serve, or what?
You know, that Skyworks deal isn't just going to sit there.
Look, I came here to get a good game in.
All right?
Now serve the goddamn ball!
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, darling.
So good to see you.
Did you lose weight?
Me?
No.
So how's New York?
It's okay.
Did you meet a nice girl already?
- Jeez, Meg, please.
- You stay out of this.
We didn't put him through college to meet nice girls.
Actually, I did meet someone.
A while back.
Really?
Yeah, but it got complicated.
You've got no time for complicated, son.
I know, Dad, better than anyone.
It's a lonely road to the top.
So you've told me, like, a million times.
What, is good advice not good enough for you anymore?
Forget it.
Remember you're only the man you are today because I pushed you.
I know.
I didn't have a father who held my hand and showed me how things worked.
Okay.
Mine was drunk half the time, barely knew my goddamn name.
I made sure you got everything you wanted.
Everything.
I don't have everything, Dad.
What are you talking about?
You can make more money in a day than most people do in a lifetime.
- So what?
- "So what?"
So what else is there?
Your mom said you were here.
What have you got there?
I was looking around.
Found some old photographs.
Look at you.
You're quite the rebel.
Oh, God.
That's not Mom, is it?
No, your mom was the one taking this picture.
- Yeah, right.
- God, I remember that day so well.
This girl in the picture here, she was your mom's best friend.
She came on to me, but I wasn't into her.
It was your mom I was after.
She gave me such a hard time.
But in the end, that day was the best day of my life.
There must be another one of your mom and me, 'cause I remember, we took it in turns to take the pictures.
My God, look at this.
My father when he was a kid, and my grandmother and her second husband.
What's this?
What?
Is it a letter?
I'll be damned.
It's my real grandfather.
I told you about him when you were a kid, but you probably won't remember.
I do remember.
I remember it really well.
He's the one that went to the First World War, right?
Yeah, somewhere in Flanders.
I can't believe you found this.
My grandmother must have hidden it, because her second husband was a real jealous guy.
Read the letter.
No, you'd better.
All right.
"My love, I only have a few moments to write this letter
"as we are called to the front.
"I am scared, but I am also determined to survive
"and come home to you and our baby boy.
"Because if this war has taught me something,
"it is that nothing in this life is more important
"than to be with the one you love.
"Yours forever, Stewart."
You know,
I've always loved your mother.
And you.
Always.
His uniform should be able to tell us more about the regiment he was serving in.
- Do you mind if I keep this for a while?
- No.
I think I know someone who can help us with this.
I'm very happy your father is not sick anymore.
I'm sorry I rushed off like that, without any explanation.
It's been a difficult month.
Not a lot of things happened here since you left.
Except for Jos, of course.
What happened?
He lost his bird, Wittekop.
Apparently it didn't return from a practice flight.
Jos thinks that maybe a bird of prey got it.
- He is very sad.
- Oh, yes.
He almost never leaves the house.
Luckily enough there's still Isabelle to take care of him.
I wouldn't know what he would do without that girl.
This is good.
Don't let it get cold.
The prodigal son returns.
Is Isabelle here?
Why do you want to know?
I want to talk to her.
I'll go get her.
Now get out of here.
Pierre, easy.
Pierre, stop it!
What are you doing here?
I came back.
Bad idea.
Can we talk?
I've got nothing to say to you.
- Isabelle please, just give me five minutes.
- No.
- Five minutes, please.
- Go away.
No.
Just disappear again like you did last time.
Without a word.
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean to...
Go away!
Go back to New York and let us be!
Now get going.
Okay.
But I'll be coming back.
Good.
I'll be waiting.
I heard you were back.
Recognize Speed?
He got big in one month.
Look at his feathers.
Beautiful.
Look at his wings.
I should start practicing with him, but...
Why did you come back?
I want to tell the truth to Isabelle.
You can't.
You promised you wouldn't tell anyone.
I have to.
I want her to know who I really am.
I want to make things right again.
Then get my bird back.
That's the one thing I can't do.
I didn't touch the money, you know.
- I know.
- So what's the problem?
Go and tell that Arabic bastard that he has no right to keep my bird.
He forced me into selling it.
He didn't force you.
I did.
Tell him that.
I can't.
I'll lose my job and everything I ever worked for.
I'm sure you'll find a way.
Not in this case.
The Sheikh has put a huge amount of money into our company's hedge fund.
Hedge funds only make rich people richer.
Exactly.
And they don't like to give things back.
You don't know if you don't ask.
Believe me.
I've worked a long time for these people.
They won't.
Then get the hell out of here.
And don't come near my granddaughter.
I'll break your neck.
You spoil me, Martha.
Enjoy.
Please.
Won't you sit with me?
- I must do things...
- Please.
Yes.
Because I can see you are sad.
You went to Jos?
- Yeah.
- How is he?
Like you said, depressed.
It will take a long time for him to forget Wittekop.
He was very special.
I don't understand.
I know he's a great champion, but...
It's still just a pigeon.
No, no, no, no.
Not just a pigeon.
What do you mean?
Wittekop is...
How do you say?
Not your real name, but...
- A nickname.
- Yes.
In Flemish we say "wittekop" to someone with blonde hair.
Like Jos' son.
His name was Tony.
Have you heard of him?
I've seen pictures.
He died in a car crash.
Wittekop was the first pigeon to come out of the egg after Tony died.
Do you see?
The whole village knows that bird.
We all know how much Jos loves it.
And when we see it fly, we think of his son.
Sorry.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the start of The Barcelona International, the most important race of the year, with 33,000 pigeons participating.
Attention for the start of the race.
Five, four, three, two, one.
They took off.
Try not to think about it.
Some more coffee?
No, I'm good.
Did you hear?
Colin is back.
Yes, so I've heard.
He came to De Zavelput, but I kicked him out.
Well done.
Why... did that asshole come back, for Christ's sake?
Darling, come back here.
Come on.
Give that to me.
I wasn't planning on ever telling you, but he won't leave you alone, so I'd rather you hear it from me.
That... asshole isn't called Colin Evans, but Colin Montgomery.
And he wasn't here to find a grave.
Instead, he was hired to convince me to sell Wittekop.
Here.
His business card.
Did you sell Wittekop?
- I had no choice.
- How so?
He threatened to have this financing group he works for, take over Boulaert and to build all over the Kleiputten.
Mr. Montgomery.
Not a lot of people have been able to track down the Sheikh all the way here to Euskirchen.
Well, I hope I'm not intruding.
No, on the contrary.
Oh, look.
Our pigeons are just starting their training.
These are youngsters.
It's their first time out.
Actually, the entire wing is full of birds.
The very best money can buy.
Please follow me.
Mr. Montgomery, how good to see you here.
Good to see you again.
This is Mr. Conrad.
I race my European pigeons from his loft.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hello.
You must be very good.
I do my best.
But the competition is very tough.
Would you like some tea?
Thank you.
I heard you were in Belgium.
Yes, I was visiting Jos Pauwels.
Interesting.
How is he doing?
Well, as a matter of fact,
I wanted to talk to you about something that concerns him.
If you will excuse me, I have to tend to the pigeons.
Seems to me your pigeons are in excellent hands.
Yes.
If only we could have better results.
I was wondering if we could talk about the pigeon I recently acquired for you.
I hope you found my gratitude to be sufficiently generous?
Yes, very generous.
Thank you.
It's just that I recently discovered that the ties between a fancier and his bird can be very intense.
Oh, yes, very much so.
That's why I...
I was wondering if you would reconsider Wittekop.
What do you mean, reconsider?
Mr. Pauwels really regrets his decision.
A lot.
I'm not surprised.
That bird is amazing.
And it's going to stay with me until the day it dies.
I have to run.
I hope you'll stay for the night.
Maybe I could use your advice in a few financial matters.
Of course.
- Is Colin here?
- No.
Why?
That's a pity.
You can't imagine what I've discovered about his great-grandfather.
It's, it's... just unbelievable.
That's Colin's great-grandfather.
He looks a lot like Colin.
And that picture was taken near the Cloth Hall in Ypres.
Do you see that truck in the background?
Look here.
That's the same truck.
Look closely at it.
It's full of pigeons.
That's a rolling pigeon loft.
Because pigeons were crucial to communication in World War One.
And the men who took care of those pigeons were called the Pigeoneers.
And now...
Hold on.
Here.
Now have a close look at what's standing behind that soldier's leg.
Do you see?
That's a pigeon basket.
Colin's great-grandfather was a Pigeoneer.
- Where's Wittekop?
- He's racing.
In the Barcelona International.
I want to talk to the Sheikh.
Now.
I want to talk to him now.
What's the matter?
What were you doing in my loft?
I tricked Jos Pauwels into selling Wittekop to you.
What do you mean, you tricked him?
I forced him into selling by threatening to destroy something very dear to him and his granddaughter.
- Does Mr. Walden know about this?
- No.
You have to give that bird back to its rightful owner.
Mr. Pauwels is heartbroken because of what I did.
I want you to leave the estate.
Right now.
Are you leaving?
Yeah, I'm going back to New York.
- No.
You can't.
- Why not?
Because I was looking for you everywhere yesterday.
I think that I know where your great-grandfather is buried.
- Do you know who Cher Ami is?
- No.
Cher Ami was a famous war pigeon.
He saved 600 British soldiers in the Great War.
It's...
It's an incredible story.
The British soldiers, they were lost in enemy territory.
And their only hope of survival was their last pigeon, Cher Ami.
And the Germans, they saw the bird take off and they opened fire.
And it was hit several times, but it kept on going.
And it arrived at the command post, one eye shot out, a bullet in his breast and most of the leg that had the message capsule attached missing.
But the soldiers were saved.
And Cher Ami, he received an Honorary Service Cross and after he died, a small statue was mounted in its honor on a little cemetery here.
And I'm convinced that your great-grandfather is resting there.
Good morning.
Could I speak to Mr. Pauwels, please?
What can I do for you?
Mr. Pauwels, it's an honor for me to meet such a great pigeon fancier as yourself.
I was wondering if we could have a word together.
You have already what you want, no?
That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about.
Come inside.
Would you like some sugar?
Three teaspoons, please.
I'm sorry to intrude in such an early hour, but I'd like to be back in Euskirchen when my birds return from Barcelona.
- Wittekop is racing also.
- What?
You're racing him in the Barcelona?
Why not?
You don't race a bird that comes from another loft over such a great distance.
- It will get lost.
- Wittekop can do it.
Who says so?
You'd never take the risk if you would care for that bird.
What is it with you people?
You think I'm a heartless person?
Yes.
You and your friend, Mr. Montgomery.
My grandfather is heartbroken because he has lost his bird.
I know that.
Mr. Montgomery has told me this last night.
He was with you, was he?
Were you two celebrating on how you fooled a couple of simple-minded Belgians?
Quite the opposite.
He came to try and convince me to return Wittekop to your grandfather.
He says you never intended to sell it.
Is that correct?
Yes.
It is, yeah.
He also says he tricked you into selling the bird to me.
He did.
What a fool.
He must realize this will be the end of his promising career.
He must care for you a great deal, Mr. Pauwels.
I'm not so sure that I'm the one he cares about.
Do you know where he is now?
No.
I kicked him off my property last night.
I'd go and look for him if I were you.
Where is she going?
She flies to the one she loves.
- Is Colin here?
- No.
He packed his bags this morning and left.
- Where to?
- Back to New York, he said.
I told him I think I know which cemetery his great-grandfather is buried at, but he didn't seem to care anymore.
- Which cemetery?
- Croonaert Chapel Cemetery.
- Yes, but where is it?
- Right here, in Heuvelland.
Do you want my moped?
Is this the grave?
Yeah, this one right here.
Stewart Montgomery?
I'm not the guy you think I am.
Yes, you are.
You're exactly the guy I think you are.
I'm happy to see you.
He's at least an hour and a half early.
Yeah.
He did a great time, but he flew to the wrong loft.
So he will be disqualified.
Then let's try again next year.
Do you accept my proposal?
Shall we work together in the future?
He can live here?
This is his home.
(EXPLOSIONS)
JASON:
I know it's always difficult to determine the value, but the share price is the share price, Mr. Karadeniz.
What we can do, I'm sure you'll appreciate this, is offer you a fair deal in terms of...
As I told Mr. Walden,
I'm not interested in profit participation.
WFG needs my shares.
I grant you, sir, your shares are important for our overall strategy...
Jason, your wife is calling.
How are you, Mr. Karadeniz?
I'm not selling for $18 a share.
Oh, I'm not negotiating this.
This is Jason's deal.
We just need to give him a couple of minutes.
Which way to the bedroom?
It's over there.
Wow.
I love the view.
So do I.
(CHUCKLING)
(SKYPE CHIMING)
Mr. Karadeniz, how are you?
Am I interrupting something?
No.
No, it's okay.
We're just...
I can call later.
No, it's fine.
It's fine, I assure you.
Asshole.
Everybody's sucking your dick about the Karadeniz deal.
- Congratulations, you did it.
- Thank you.
I've got a real big one for you.
Sheikh Abdullah Nayed.
Estimated capital, 10 billion.
Wow.
Erik almost got him to invest a half a billion, but now he's about to sign with Horizon Capital.
I want you to take over.
Get him.
Just start with the small shareholders and work your way up.
Don't worry about that.
Just get it done.
Mr. Montgomery.
Mr. Smith.
Thank you for helping me arrange this.
Useless.
This is garbage.
Who the hell did you use?
No.
No, I need real in-depth research on the guy.
Fast.
Deal with it.
Mr. Montgomery.
The Sheikh will see you now.
According to our religion, feeding birds and treating them well is a good behavior,
identified with acquiring merit in the eyes of Allah.
And it was a pigeon that helped Muhammad when he escaped from the Quraish.
I'm telling you this because I know many people find it hard to believe that a Sheikh could be a passionate piggeon fancier.
Well, I heard Mike Tyson does it.
That's pretty hard to believe, too.
When I'm with my birds, I feel they bring the best out of me.
I'm sure this is also the case for Mr. Tyson.
I've already told Mr. Walden that I won't be investing in your company.
I like the sound they make.
Isn't it soothing?
Very.
Have you ever wondered why pigeons are the symbol of peace, of love and good will?
Every time I hold them in my hands and look into their eyes, it's as if I understand exactly why.
To care for them, to see these noble birds race, makes me the happiest man in the world.
How do you race pigeons?
Do they fly in circles?
No.
They fly in a straight line back to their loft.
The most fantastic race in the world is the Barcelona international.
The birds have to fly over 1,000 miles to get back home.
Can you imagine?
That's a long way for such a small bird.
Indeed.
It takes them two days to cover the distance.
The Barcelona race is the epitome of endurance, the synonym of willpower, a hymn to love.
Love?
Yes.
Because the birds fly home to the one they've left behind.
They want to be reunited as quickly as possible with the one they love.
It's my dream to win that race one day.
What does it take?
The right bird.
And you don't have it?
No.
A very, very stubborn man named Jos Pauwels has it.
We have offered him a huge amount of money, but he doesn't want to sell.
Why not?
I don't know.
Where is he, this Pauwels?
Flanders, in Belgium.
Have you heard of it?
An ancestor of mine supposedly died there in World War I.
But let me ask you a favor.
Let me prove to you that you can trust us with your investment.
Let me get you that bird.
I told you, it can't be done.
Even better.
Let me show you that with hard work and determination
WFG can do what can't be done.
I'm very close to signing with Horizon.
Then I'd better act fast.
DAVID:
...he used to be the village doctor.
The pigeon he's holding is the champion dove the Sheikh wants, Wittekop.
This is his granddaughter, Isabelle.
She's a student at the University of Ghent.
Her mother moved back to Holland, so now she lives with Jos.
It's raining.
Again.
Welcome to Belgium.
Mr. Montgomery, welcome to Belgium.
Didn't get the memo?
It's Mr. Evans.
I've found lodging in the village itself, as you requested.
Great.
But I have to warn you, it might not be very comfortable.
Because the place I found is not really a hotel.
- It's a...
A parsonage.
- What?
The local priest is renting out a room because the Church needs extra money, I suppose.
But I can book you a hotel in a city nearby.
Everything is very close in Belgium.
No, it's perfect.
I want to blend in.
Okay.
Here's your Belgian cell phone.
My number is in it in case you need anything.
Great, thanks.
Voila, this is it.
A very modest car, like you asked.
But we can change it, if you want.
No, it's perfect.
GPS:
Turn back to the indicated road.
Yeah, yeah.
The indicated road is closed, wise guy.
Oh, what the fuck...
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Shit.
Excuse me.
Sorry, ma'am?
PRIEST:
She's asleep, sir.
And without her hearing aid she's as deaf as a post.
Anna, Anna?
Time to go home.
Mass is finished.
See you tomorrow, Anna.
Good-bye.
She falls asleep every morning, before I even can reach the altar.
- You must be Colin Evans.
- Yeah.
Did you walk all the way from America?
My car got stuck in the mud a couple of miles back.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll send someone later to pull it out.
You know, I was raised by parents that considered the Americans as our saviors.
And that's why I'm so touched by you trying to find your ancestor's grave.
Because he died for my freedom.
I apologize for the mess.
I wanted to replace the old furniture with more modern things, but I didn't have the time to assemble everything.
Don't worry, I'll deduct it from the room rate.
It's IKEA.
Do you have IKEA in America?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
IKEA is everywhere.
It's like my boss.
The bathroom is across the hall, over there.
Dinner is at 7:00.
Today is chicken.
I've asked Martha, my housekeeper, to choose Cecile.
She's a nice, fat chick.
I mean Cecile.
Cecile is, not Martha.
Right.
See you tonight.
I was wondering, I couldn't find your Wi-Fi.
My what?
Your Internet connection.
Oh, no, no.
No Internet here.
No.
God is my provider. (LAUGHING)
Right.
I've selected a few books about the Great War for you from my library.
I know it sounds strange for a man in my position, but I'm very interested in war.
I don't know why.
But I'm sure you'll find them quite interesting and they could help you to locate your ancestor's grave.
Yeah.
Thank you.
All right.
I wonder, do you know in which battle he was killed?
No.
I only know it was in Flanders.
The American troops have never been here.
They landed in France.
He was English.
My great-grandmother moved to the US with her son after her husband was killed.
Oh, I see.
I was fearing you would think that Flanders was just a part of France.
Many people in the US make that mistake.
Yeah.
I'm a high school teacher.
So I'm not supposed to make those kind of mistakes.
Of course.
I should have known.
Ah!
- Enjoy.
- Thank you very much, Martha.
Cecile, as beautiful in death as she was in life.
Good morning.
The...
He is in church.
Morning Mass.
I see.
- Eggs?
- Yes, please.
Is this decaf?
What?
It's like coffee, but without the caffeine.
We're honest people here, sir.
Oh, one's enough, thank you.
So, Martha, are you from around here?
Yes.
I've lived here all my life.
I know everyone.
So tell me, what do people do around here all day?
They work.
And when they're not working?
They...
They like football.
You know, with the feet.
They like...
TV.
They like...
I was wondering, is there a local pub around here somewhere?
Yes.
In De Zavelput.
It's three kilometers.
Say if you want more, huh.
Hey, what's up?
Nice day today, huh?
Let me help you.
That's okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What would you like to drink?
I'll have a Coke, please.
I'm Isabelle.
I'm Colin.
Colin Evans.
Yeah.
I know who you are.
Everyone in the village is already talking about you.
I only just got here.
Well, it's very easy to become a star in this town.
In the whole of Flanders, for that matter.
I thought you didn't understand English.
English, yes.
American, no.
He used to be my English teacher.
PIERRE:
Yeah.
Until so-called "health problems" got me fired.
That's the weirdest pool table I ever saw.
It's very typical for Belgium.
It's a fun game, you know.
Really?
I'm actually pretty good at pool.
Oh, yeah?
Would you like to try?
Sure, I'd love to.
Do you want red or white?
Red.
Of course.
The color of aggression.
Pierre, leave him in peace.
And Coca-Cola.
So you line up the balls like this.
The game is very simple.
The one who first succeeds in pocketing his five balls in the opponent's pocket, wins.
We both start at the same time.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll count to three and then we shoot.
Ready?
One, two...
PIERRE:
Wait, wait.
You first have to make a bet.
It's his first time, so let's forget about that.
No, no, I think we should.
I'll buy Pierre a beer every time I lose.
How about that?
Fantastic.
But I want you to have one, too.
Sorry, I don't drink alcohol this early in the day.
"Sorry, I don't drink alcohol so early in the day."
Fine.
I'll have one, too.
Okay, here goes.
One, two, three.
Nice shot.
Thanks.
So, do you work here full-time?
No, only during the summer.
I study biology at the university in Ghent.
What about you?
I'm a high school teacher.
That's why I have all summer to find that grave.
Yeah, I heard about that.
I think it's really great that you do this.
Well, family ties are important to me and my entire family.
One day, I want to be able to tell my kids where they came from so they might better understand where they're heading.
That's beautiful.
Two beers, please.
No mercy, huh?
You don't look like the kind of guy that needs it.
A rematch after this one?
Why not?
Shall I walk you to the door?
No.
I'm fine, thank you.
Here, your keys.
No.
You keep the car.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You're still gonna help me find that grave, right?
Yeah.
I'm happy to help.
It's exciting.
- Sure you don't need help?
- Thank you.
I'm good.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hey.
Drink lots of water, okay?
Thank you.
That's very sound advice.
(ROOSTER CROWING)
Come on.
(GRUNTING)
(ROOSTER CROWING)
(GRUNTING)
- You're sure this is going to work?
- Yes.
But you must drink it all in one time.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How are you feeling?
Good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Wait, you still have...
- First time you're wearing this?
- Yeah.
- Well, it looks good on you.
- Thanks.
So what cemetery shall we go to first?
I don't know.
There's a lot of them, right?
Yeah, more than 100.
- Let's start with the biggest one.
- Okay.
So, where do we start?
Mmm.
These are really good.
You can't live in Belgium if you don't like French fries with mayonnaise.
Sure feels good to be out in the open.
This really reminds me of where I was born and raised.
Where was that?
Bearsville, New York.
It's near Woodstock.
Woodstock.
Wow.
Yeah, don't get too excited.
Nothing really happens there anymore.
Does your family still live there?
Yeah, but me and my dad, we...
He's always pushing me.
Ever since I was a kid.
It wears me out sometimes.
I hardly ever see my parents.
What?
Nothing.
It's just that
I thought you said family ties are really important to you.
They are.
They are.
It's just...
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to come across all gloomy.
Must be the country air messing with my head.
- Oh, God, is it 2:00 already?
- Ten past.
Shit.
I promised my granddad I'd join him at the club.
- The club?
What kind of club?
- A pigeon club.
- A what?
- He races pigeons.
He's really good at it.
I never knew you could race pigeons.
Well, it's a big sport around here.
Well, I'd love to see this.
Let's go.
Thank God.
I thought you wouldn't make it.
And I can't manage without my mascot.
He says I bring him luck.
Not that his birds need it.
So, you are the American?
I'm afraid I am.
Isabelle tells me you race pigeons.
Sounds very interesting.
Really?
Tell me, what's the thing that makes it interesting to you?
Just the whole concept, you know.
The whole concept?
- Jos, your turn.
- Okay.
Don't worry about my granddad.
He's always a bit overprotective when I...
You know, when he sees me with someone.
So he should be.
What are they doing?
Well, the pigeons all have a ring with all their data on it.
And that big guy over there, he scans the rings.
And from that moment on, the pigeons are officially in the race.
The birds are then put together in shipping crates and brought to the start of the race, which is,
Amiens.
That's in France.
How far is that from here?
About 200 kilometers.
Look.
That's Wittekop.
It's his favorite bird.
(COOING SOFTLY)
What happens next?
Tonight, trucks will take all the birds to Amiens.
And tomorrow, around 10:00 a.m., the birds will all be released at the same time.
Thousands of them.
The first one home wins.
A real champion dove can be worth a lot of money.
Up to 200,000 euros.
I'm sure your friend is not interested in the financial aspect of the sport.
Oh, I find it fascinating, sir.
I'd love to know more.
You should show him your loft.
Tomorrow I could make us a nice lunch.
We could all wait for the birds to return.
That'd be awesome.
Thank you.
I'm warning you.
It's boring.
He hates my guts.
He'll warm up to you.
You'll see.
So, are you ready for some more country air to mess with your head?
Sure.
(GEESE HONKING)
(BOTTLES CLINKING)
This is a really beautiful spot.
I've lived here all my life.
But when my father died, my mom went back to Holland.
And I went to live with my granddad.
But the house is still ours.
I'd be heartbroken if anything would happen to this place.
Why would something happen to it?
Well, a while ago, there was this Belgian building company and they were planning on putting, like, a huge apartment complex here.
Luckily they ran out of financing, but...
I swear, I'd chain myself to a tree.
I'd do whatever it takes to save this place.
Why is it that everything beautiful has to be turned into a mall or a gas station?
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Yes, David.
What have you got for me?
DAVID:
The construction company you're looking for is called Boulaert NV.
Where are they located?
Actually, not that far from you, in Bruges.
All right, set up a meeting with their CEO for tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.
And then book me on a flight to New York the day after.
You got it.
(EXHALING)
Are you coming to the party tonight?
What party?
It's to support our local marching band.
The whole village will be there.
You really should come, too.
Sure.
I'll be there.
Who's the guy in all the pictures with your grandfather?
That's my dad.
So he was a pigeon guy, too?
Oh, yes.
But Mom hated his pigeons because they shat on her laundry.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
So he brought them here.
They've won a lot of races together.
The Barcelona Classic was their dream.
They'd just started to train birds specifically for that race,
but then he died.
In a car crash three years ago.
So is Jos coming home soon?
He is home.
He's in his loft.
Hey.
You ever hold a pigeon?
No.
This is Romeo.
How does that feel?
It's great.
It's great.
I can feel its heart.
It's racing.
Yeah.
It's because he doesn't know you.
You should talk to him.
What should I say?
Whatever you want.
Calm him down.
Hey, handsome.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you.
He likes you.
I will show you something.
What do I do with Romeo?
Put him back in his spot.
Look at this.
Take it.
So tiny.
Just into the world.
Pigeons grow very fast, you know.
In three months' time this baby will be ready to race.
You should give him a name.
- What, me?
- Yeah.
Maybe one day, he'll win a race for you.
All right.
Speed.
I'll call him Speed.
Okay.
From now on, whenever we see this bird fly, we'll think of you.
Wittekop?
That's fast, mate.
He's getting better by the day.
You think he's the first one?
Maybe, yeah.
We have to go to the club to see if he has won.
All right, let's go check.
Jos, last night, someone broke into Marcel's.
Yeah, all his pigeons are gone.
Good lord.
COLIN:
Is something wrong?
Marcel got robbed of all his pigeons.
It's horrible.
He spent a lifetime building those birds.
Marcel.
(SOBBING)
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
I'm Colin Montgomery from WFG.
I have an appointment with Mr. Boulaert.
Yes, Mr. Boulaert is expecting you.
Please follow me.
(KNOCKING)
MARTHA:
Colin?
If you see the...
You know.
The reverend?
Yes, reverend.
Can you tell him I already go to party?
Okay.
MARTHA:
Will you come also?
I don't think so.
You must come.
Have some fun.
(MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
So you came.
I don't want to miss the number one party in Bunderzele, right?
Are you making fun of us, Mr. Evans?
Who's the singer?
I want to buy all her records.
Come on, big shot.
Show me how good you are on the dance floor.
(SLOW DANCE PLAYING)
Dear friends, I absolutely want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for showing up in such large numbers.
And I'd say, long live Bunderzele.
And now a golden oldie, a special request from our dear friend Martha.
The kissing dance.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
What?
The kissing dance.
No, no, no.
No more dancing.
Oh, come on.
So what do we do?
We kiss.
Are you having fun?
Yeah.
Good.
Now you choose a girl.
Hey, what the fuck, man?
Let's rumble.
Leave her alone.
(GRUNTING)
(ALL CLAMORING)
Idiot.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, it's just a little cut.
I haven't been in a fight since junior high.
You know, I was on my way to you when that guy stepped in.
Really?
Yeah.
Then you should finish what you started.
Wait.
Isn't this going to hurt?
I hope so.
Martha.
(KNOCKING)
Hey, what's going on in there?
Come on, Martha.
Leave them be.
- No sex before the wedding.
- Come on.
Maybe I should go inside, too.
He's not going to get her up those stairs alone.
Do you want to meet up tomorrow?
After I get back from Ghent?
Yes.
Don't wreck my car, all right?
Thanks for letting me use it.
So I'll come and pick you up sometime after noon, okay?
Your lips are cold.
Bye.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Are you sitting down?
Yes.
The Sheikh just called.
Guess how much he's prepared to put in the fund?
Half a billion, right?
Two is more like it.
Wow.
The deal's going to make you very rich, my boy.
Now, you're on top of it, aren't you?
Sure, yes.
Get it done, get your ass on a plane.
Now, you're flying home tonight, right?
I...
Yes.
Good.
Shit.
(DOORBELL RINGING)
(PIGEONS COOING)
(EXHALING)
I was just taking care of Speed.
Look how big he is, in just one day.
I didn't come here to talk about Speed.
I'm here on behalf of Sheikh Nayed.
Mr. Pauwels, I work for a very powerful financing group in New York.
The Sheikh is a client of ours.
You're wasting your time.
Wittekop is not for sale.
I know.
That's why yesterday afternoon I had a meeting with the CEO of Boulaert Construction Company in Bruges.
Our financing group intends to provide Bouiaert with the necessary funding they need to execute the plans they have for that beautiful nature spot near Isabelle's house.
You mean the Kleiputten?
Yes.
She's taken me there.
Believe me, I'd love to make sure that that site remains untouched.
But I can only do that if I can give my client what he wants.
I'll put 300,000 euros in your name in an ING bank account.
I don't want any money.
Nevertheless, it'll be there for you.
Always.
What if I told you to go fuck yourself?
Then I'd go ahead and break Isabelle's heart.
I would.
You know how much that place means to her?
She said she wouldn't let anyone touch it for as long as she lives.
And still you want to destroy it?
Let me put it this way, I wouldn't be standing here if I wasn't convinced that you love that girl more than anything in the world.
You...
You're a bastard.
That's why they pay me the big bucks.
Jos.
We're giving you a good deal here.
300,000 euros is a...
Shut up.
Shut up.
I...
I accept.
But I don't want Isabelle or anyone else to ever know.
I will tell them that the bird got lost during practice.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Sign here.
You had everything prepared, huh?
Always.
Someone will pick up the bird later today when Isabelle's in Ghent.
Listen.
Here's my card.
Just in case.
Montgomery?
That's your real name?
Yes.
And that great-grandfather of yours?
Is he a lie, too?
No.
As a matter of fact, he isn't.
Well, then I feel very sorry for him.
Goodbye.
Please sign here.
Thank you.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Sir?
Excuse me, sir?
Do you want to take the call?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
That was fun.
We should do this again someday soon.
Sure.
Bye.
(WHOOPING)
Come on.
You know, we can't wait any longer, man.
We're gonna have to do it now.
It's your serve, David.
Look.
I've looked at the numbers and I'm saying we move now.
Are you going to serve, or what?
You know, that Skyworks deal isn't just going to sit there.
Look, I came here to get a good game in.
All right?
Now serve the goddamn ball!
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, darling.
So good to see you.
Did you lose weight?
Me?
No.
So how's New York?
It's okay.
Did you meet a nice girl already?
- Jeez, Meg, please.
- You stay out of this.
We didn't put him through college to meet nice girls.
Actually, I did meet someone.
A while back.
Really?
Yeah, but it got complicated.
You've got no time for complicated, son.
I know, Dad, better than anyone.
It's a lonely road to the top.
So you've told me, like, a million times.
What, is good advice not good enough for you anymore?
Forget it.
Remember you're only the man you are today because I pushed you.
I know.
I didn't have a father who held my hand and showed me how things worked.
Okay.
Mine was drunk half the time, barely knew my goddamn name.
I made sure you got everything you wanted.
Everything.
I don't have everything, Dad.
What are you talking about?
You can make more money in a day than most people do in a lifetime.
- So what?
- "So what?"
So what else is there?
(COLIN SCOFFS)
(CHUCKLING)
(FOOTSTEPS CLIMBING STAIRS)
Your mom said you were here.
What have you got there?
I was looking around.
Found some old photographs.
Look at you.
Oh!
You're quite the rebel.
(CHUCKLING) Oh, God.
That's not Mom, is it?
No, your mom was the one taking this picture.
- Yeah, right.
- God, I remember that day so well.
This girl in the picture here, she was your mom's best friend.
She came on to me, but I wasn't into her.
It was your mom I was after.
She gave me such a hard time.
But in the end, that day was the best day of my life.
There must be another one of your mom and me, 'cause I remember, we took it in turns to take the pictures.
My God, look at this.
My father when he was a kid, and my grandmother and her second husband.
What's this?
What?
Is it a letter?
I'll be damned.
It's my real grandfather.
I told you about him when you were a kid, but you probably won't remember.
I do remember.
I remember it really well.
He's the one that went to the First World War, right?
Yeah, somewhere in Flanders.
I can't believe you found this.
My grandmother must have hidden it, because her second husband was a real jealous guy.
Read the letter.
Oh.
No, you'd better.
All right.
"My love, I only have a few moments to write this letter
"as we are called to the front.
"I am scared, but I am also determined to survive
"and come home to you and our baby boy.
"Because if this war has taught me something,
"it is that nothing in this life is more important
"than to be with the one you love.
"Yours forever, Stewart."
You know,
I've always loved your mother.
And you.
Always.
His uniform should be able to tell us more about the regiment he was serving in.
- Do you mind if I keep this for a while?
- No.
I think I know someone who can help us with this.
Ah!
I'm very happy your father is not sick anymore.
I'm sorry I rushed off like that, without any explanation.
It's been a difficult month.
Not a lot of things happened here since you left.
Except for Jos, of course.
What happened?
He lost his bird, Wittekop.
Apparently it didn't return from a practice flight.
Jos thinks that maybe a bird of prey got it.
- He is very sad.
- Oh, yes.
He almost never leaves the house.
Luckily enough there's still Isabelle to take care of him.
I wouldn't know what he would do without that girl.
Mmm.
This is good.
Don't let it get cold.
The prodigal son returns.
Is Isabelle here?
Why do you want to know?
I want to talk to her.
I'll go get her.
Now get out of here.
Pierre, easy.
Pierre, stop it!
What are you doing here?
I came back.
Bad idea.
Can we talk?
I've got nothing to say to you.
- Isabelle please, just give me five minutes.
- No.
- Five minutes, please.
- Go away.
No.
Just disappear again like you did last time.
Without a word.
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean to...
Go away!
Go back to New York and let us be!
Now get going.
Okay.
But I'll be coming back.
Good.
I'll be waiting.
(PIGEONS COOING)
I heard you were back.
Recognize Speed?
He got big in one month.
Look at his feathers.
Beautiful.
Look at his wings.
I should start practicing with him, but...
Why did you come back?
I want to tell the truth to Isabelle.
You can't.
You promised you wouldn't tell anyone.
I have to.
I want her to know who I really am.
I want to make things right again.
Then get my bird back.
That's the one thing I can't do.
I didn't touch the money, you know.
- I know.
- So what's the problem?
Go and tell that Arabic bastard that he has no right to keep my bird.
He forced me into selling it.
He didn't force you.
I did.
Tell him that.
I can't.
I'll lose my job and everything I ever worked for.
I'm sure you'll find a way.
Not in this case.
The Sheikh has put a huge amount of money into our company's hedge fund.
Hedge funds only make rich people richer.
Exactly.
And they don't like to give things back.
You don't know if you don't ask.
Believe me.
I've worked a long time for these people.
They won't.
Then get the hell out of here.
And don't come near my granddaughter.
I'll break your neck.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Ah.
You spoil me, Martha.
Enjoy.
Please.
Won't you sit with me?
- I must do things...
- Please.
Yes.
Because I can see you are sad.
You went to Jos?
- Yeah.
- How is he?
Like you said, depressed.
It will take a long time for him to forget Wittekop.
He was very special.
I don't understand.
I know he's a great champion, but...
It's still just a pigeon.
No, no, no, no.
Not just a pigeon.
What do you mean?
Wittekop is...
How do you say?
Not your real name, but...
- A nickname.
- Yes.
In Flemish we say "wittekop" to someone with blonde hair.
Like Jos' son.
His name was Tony.
Have you heard of him?
I've seen pictures.
He died in a car crash.
Wittekop was the first pigeon to come out of the egg after Tony died.
Do you see?
The whole village knows that bird.
We all know how much Jos loves it.
And when we see it fly, we think of his son.
Sorry.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the start of The Barcelona International, the most important race of the year, with 33,000 pigeons participating.
Attention for the start of the race.
Five, four, three, two, one.
They took off.
Try not to think about it.
Some more coffee?
No, I'm good.
(EXHALING)
Did you hear?
Colin is back.
Yes, so I've heard.
He came to De Zavelput, but I kicked him out.
Well done.
Why... did that asshole come back, for Christ's sake?
Darling, come back here.
Come on.
Give that to me.
I wasn't planning on ever telling you, but he won't leave you alone, so I'd rather you hear it from me.
That... asshole isn't called Colin Evans, but Colin Montgomery.
And he wasn't here to find a grave.
Instead, he was hired to convince me to sell Wittekop.
Here.
His business card.
Did you sell Wittekop?
- I had no choice.
- How so?
He threatened to have this financing group he works for, take over Boulaert and to build all over the Kleiputten.
(SNIFFLING)
Mr. Montgomery.
Not a lot of people have been able to track down the Sheikh all the way here to Euskirchen.
Well, I hope I'm not intruding.
No, on the contrary.
Oh, look.
Our pigeons are just starting their training.
These are youngsters.
It's their first time out.
Actually, the entire wing is full of birds.
The very best money can buy.
Please follow me.
Mr. Montgomery, how good to see you here.
Good to see you again.
This is Mr. Conrad.
I race my European pigeons from his loft.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hello.
You must be very good.
I do my best.
But the competition is very tough.
Would you like some tea?
Thank you.
I heard you were in Belgium.
Yes, I was visiting Jos Pauwels.
Interesting.
How is he doing?
Well, as a matter of fact,
I wanted to talk to you about something that concerns him.
(CLEARING THROAT)
If you will excuse me, I have to tend to the pigeons.
Seems to me your pigeons are in excellent hands.
Yes.
If only we could have better results.
I was wondering if we could talk about the pigeon I recently acquired for you.
I hope you found my gratitude to be sufficiently generous?
Yes, very generous.
Thank you.
It's just that I recently discovered that the ties between a fancier and his bird can be very intense.
Oh, yes, very much so.
That's why I...
I was wondering if you would reconsider Wittekop.
What do you mean, reconsider?
Mr. Pauwels really regrets his decision.
A lot.
I'm not surprised.
That bird is amazing.
And it's going to stay with me until the day it dies.
I have to run.
I hope you'll stay for the night.
Maybe I could use your advice in a few financial matters.
Of course.
(KNOCKING)
- Is Colin here?
- No.
Why?
That's a pity.
You can't imagine what I've discovered about his great-grandfather.
It's, it's... just unbelievable.
That's Colin's great-grandfather.
He looks a lot like Colin.
And that picture was taken near the Cloth Hall in Ypres.
Do you see that truck in the background?
Look here.
That's the same truck.
Look closely at it.
It's full of pigeons.
That's a rolling pigeon loft.
Because pigeons were crucial to communication in World War One.
And the men who took care of those pigeons were called the Pigeoneers.
And now...
Hold on.
Here.
Now have a close look at what's standing behind that soldier's leg.
Do you see?
That's a pigeon basket.
Colin's great-grandfather was a Pigeoneer.
(BIRDS FLUTTERING)
(ALARM BELL RINGING)
(DOGS BARKING)
- Where's Wittekop?
- He's racing.
In the Barcelona International.
I want to talk to the Sheikh.
Now.
I want to talk to him now.
What's the matter?
What were you doing in my loft?
I tricked Jos Pauwels into selling Wittekop to you.
What do you mean, you tricked him?
I forced him into selling by threatening to destroy something very dear to him and his granddaughter.
- Does Mr. Walden know about this?
- No.
You have to give that bird back to its rightful owner.
Mr. Pauwels is heartbroken because of what I did.
I want you to leave the estate.
Right now.
Are you leaving?
Yeah, I'm going back to New York.
- No.
You can't.
- Why not?
Because I was looking for you everywhere yesterday.
I think that I know where your great-grandfather is buried.
- Do you know who Cher Ami is?
- No.
Cher Ami was a famous war pigeon.
He saved 600 British soldiers in the Great War.
It's...
It's an incredible story.
The British soldiers, they were lost in enemy territory.
And their only hope of survival was their last pigeon, Cher Ami.
And the Germans, they saw the bird take off and they opened fire.
And it was hit several times, but it kept on going.
And it arrived at the command post, one eye shot out, a bullet in his breast and most of the leg that had the message capsule attached missing.
But the soldiers were saved.
And Cher Ami, he received an Honorary Service Cross and after he died, a small statue was mounted in its honor on a little cemetery here.
And I'm convinced that your great-grandfather is resting there.
Good morning.
Could I speak to Mr. Pauwels, please?
What can I do for you?
Mr. Pauwels, it's an honor for me to meet such a great pigeon fancier as yourself.
I was wondering if we could have a word together.
You have already what you want, no?
That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about.
Come inside.
Would you like some sugar?
SHEIKH:
Three teaspoons, please.
I'm sorry to intrude in such an early hour, but I'd like to be back in Euskirchen when my birds return from Barcelona.
- Wittekop is racing also.
- What?
You're racing him in the Barcelona?
Why not?
You don't race a bird that comes from another loft over such a great distance.
- It will get lost.
- Wittekop can do it.
Who says so?
You'd never take the risk if you would care for that bird.
What is it with you people?
You think I'm a heartless person?
Yes.
You and your friend, Mr. Montgomery.
My grandfather is heartbroken because he has lost his bird.
I know that.
Mr. Montgomery has told me this last night.
Oh!
He was with you, was he?
Were you two celebrating on how you fooled a couple of simple-minded Belgians?
Quite the opposite.
He came to try and convince me to return Wittekop to your grandfather.
He says you never intended to sell it.
Is that correct?
Yes.
It is, yeah.
He also says he tricked you into selling the bird to me.
He did.
What a fool.
He must realize this will be the end of his promising career.
He must care for you a great deal, Mr. Pauwels.
I'm not so sure that I'm the one he cares about.
Do you know where he is now?
No.
I kicked him off my property last night.
I'd go and look for him if I were you.
Where is she going?
She flies to the one she loves.
(DOORBELL RINGING)
- Is Colin here?
- No.
He packed his bags this morning and left.
- Where to?
- Back to New York, he said.
I told him I think I know which cemetery his great-grandfather is buried at, but he didn't seem to care anymore.
- Which cemetery?
- Croonaert Chapel Cemetery.
- Yes, but where is it?
- Right here, in Heuvelland.
Do you want my moped?
Is this the grave?
Yeah, this one right here.
Stewart Montgomery?
I'm not the guy you think I am.
Yes, you are.
You're exactly the guy I think you are.
I'm happy to see you.
SHEIKH:
He's at least an hour and a half early.
Yeah.
He did a great time, but he flew to the wrong loft.
So he will be disqualified.
Then let's try again next year.
Do you accept my proposal?
Shall we work together in the future?
He can live here?
This is his home.
How are you, Mr. Karadeniz?
Time to go home.
Mass is finished.
See you tomorrow, Anna.
Good-bye.
Enjoy.
-Thank you very much, Martha.
Pierre, leave him in peace.
Thank God.
I thought you wouldn't make it.
And I can't manage without my mascot.
Jos, your turn.
-Okay.
That's fast, mate.
Jos, last night, someone broke into Marcel's.
Yeah, all his pigeons are gone.
Good lord.
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
Dear friends, I absolutely want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for showing up in such large numbers.
And I'd say, long live Bunderzele.
And now a golden oldie, a special request from our dear friend Martha.
The kissing dance.
The kissing dance.
Let's rumble.
Idiot.
Hey, what's going on in there?
Come on, Martha.
Leave them be.
No sex before the wedding.
-Come on.
Pierre, stop it!
Enjoy.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the start of The Barcelona International, the most important race of the year, with 33,000 pigeons participating.
Attention for the start of the race.
Five, four, three, two, one.
They took off.
Try not to think about it.
Some more coffee?
No, I'm good.
Did you hear?
Colin is back.
Yes, so I've heard.
He came to De Zavelput, but I kicked him out.
Well done.
Why... did that asshole come back, for Christ's sake?
Darling, come back here.
Come on.
Give that to me.
I wasn't planning on ever telling you, but he won't leave you alone, so I'd rather you hear it from me.
That... asshole isn't called Colin Evans, but Colin Montgomery.
And he wasn't here to find a grave.
Instead, he was hired to convince me to sell Wittekop.
Here.
His business card.
Did you sell Wittekop?
I had no choice.
-How so?
He threatened to have this financing group he works for, take over Boulaert and to build all over the Kleiputten.
Is Colin here?
-No.
Why?
That's a pity.
You can't imagine what I've discovered about his great-grandfather.
It's, it's... just unbelievable.
That's Colin's great-grandfather.
He looks a lot like Colin.
And that picture was taken near the Cloth Hall in Ypres.
Do you see that truck in the background?
Look here.
That's the same truck.
Look closely at it.
It's full of pigeons.
That's a rolling pigeon loft.
Because pigeons were crucial to communication in World War One.
And the men who took care of those pigeons were called the Pigeoneers.
And now...
Hold on.
Here.
Now have a close look at what's standing behind that soldier's leg.
Do you see?
That's a pigeon basket.
Colin's great-grandfather was a Pigeoneer.
I'd go and look for him if I were you.
Is Colin here?
-No.
He packed his bags this morning and left.
Where to?
-Back to New York, he said.
I told him I think I know which cemetery his great-grandfather is buried at, but he didn't seem to care anymore.
Which cemetery?
-Croonaert Chapel Cemetery.
Yes, but where is it?
-Right here, in Heuvelland.
Do you want my moped?
I'm happy to see you.
I know it's always difficult to determine the value, but the share price is the share price, Mr. Karadeniz.
What we can do, I'm sure you'll appreciate this, is offer you a fair deal in terms of...
As I told Mr. Walden,
I'm not interested in profit participation.
WFG needs my shares.
I grant you, sir, your shares are important for our overall strategy...
Jason, your wife is calling.
How are you, Mr. Karadeniz?
I'm not selling for $18 a share.
Oh, I'm not negotiating this.
This is Jason's deal.
We just need to give him a couple of minutes.
Which way to the bedroom?
It's over there.
Wow.
I love the view.
So do I.
Mr. Karadeniz, how are you?
Am I interrupting something?
No.
No, it's okay.
We're just...
I can call later.
No, it's fine.
It's fine, I assure you.
Asshole.
Everybody's sucking your dick about the Karadeniz deal.
- Congratulations, you did it.
- Thank you.
I've got a real big one for you.
Sheikh Abdullah Nayed.
Estimated capital, 10 billion.
Wow.
Erik almost got him to invest a half a billion, but now he's about to sign with Horizon Capital.
I want you to take over.
Get him.
Just start with the small shareholders and work your way up.
Don't worry about that.
Just get it done.
Mr. Montgomery.
Mr. Smith.
Thank you for helping me arrange this.
Useless.
This is garbage.
Who the hell did you use?
No.
No, I need real in-depth research on the guy.
Fast.
Deal with it.
Mr. Montgomery.
The Sheikh will see you now.
According to our religion, feeding birds and treating them well is a good behavior,
identified with acquiring merit in the eyes of Allah.
And it was a pigeon that helped Muhammad when he escaped from the Quraish.
I'm telling you this because I know many people find it hard to believe that a Sheikh could be a passionate piggeon fancier.
Well, I heard Mike Tyson does it.
That's pretty hard to believe, too.
When I'm with my birds, I feel they bring the best out of me.
I'm sure this is also the case for Mr. Tyson.
I've already told Mr. Walden that I won't be investing in your company.
I like the sound they make.
Isn't it soothing?
Very.
Have you ever wondered why pigeons are the symbol of peace, of love and good will?
Every time I hold them in my hands and look into their eyes, it's as if I understand exactly why.
To care for them, to see these noble birds race, makes me the happiest man in the world.
How do you race pigeons?
Do they fly in circles?
No.
They fly in a straight line back to their loft.
The most fantastic race in the world is the Barcelona international.
The birds have to fly over 1,000 miles to get back home.
Can you imagine?
That's a long way for such a small bird.
Indeed.
It takes them two days to cover the distance.
The Barcelona race is the epitome of endurance, the synonym of willpower, a hymn to love.
Love?
Yes.
Because the birds fly home to the one they've left behind.
They want to be reunited as quickly as possible with the one they love.
It's my dream to win that race one day.
What does it take?
The right bird.
And you don't have it?
No.
A very, very stubborn man named Jos Pauwels has it.
We have offered him a huge amount of money, but he doesn't want to sell.
Why not?
I don't know.
Where is he, this Pauwels?
Flanders, in Belgium.
Have you heard of it?
An ancestor of mine supposedly died there in World War I.
But let me ask you a favor.
Let me prove to you that you can trust us with your investment.
Let me get you that bird.
I told you, it can't be done.
Even better.
Let me show you that with hard work and determination
WFG can do what can't be done.
I'm very close to signing with Horizon.
Then I'd better act fast.
...he used to be the village doctor.
The pigeon he's holding is the champion dove the Sheikh wants, Wittekop.
This is his granddaughter, Isabelle.
She's a student at the University of Ghent.
Her mother moved back to Holland, so now she lives with Jos.
It's raining.
Again.
Welcome to Belgium.
Mr. Montgomery, welcome to Belgium.
Didn't get the memo?
It's Mr. Evans.
I've found lodging in the village itself, as you requested.
Great.
But I have to warn you, it might not be very comfortable.
Because the place I found is not really a hotel.
- It's a...
A parsonage.
- What?
The local priest is renting out a room because the Church needs extra money, I suppose.
But I can book you a hotel in a city nearby.
Everything is very close in Belgium.
No, it's perfect.
I want to blend in.
Okay.
Here's your Belgian cell phone.
My number is in it in case you need anything.
Great, thanks.
Voila, this is it.
A very modest car, like you asked.
But we can change it, if you want.
No, it's perfect.
Turn back to the indicated road.
Yeah, yeah.
The indicated road is closed, wise guy.
Oh, what the fuck...
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Shit.
Excuse me.
Sorry, ma'am?
She's asleep, sir.
And without her hearing aid she's as deaf as a post.
Anna, Anna?
Time to go home.
Mass is finished.
See you tomorrow, Anna.
Good-bye.
She falls asleep every morning, before I even can reach the altar.
- You must be Colin Evans.
- Yeah.
Did you walk all the way from America?
My car got stuck in the mud a couple of miles back.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll send someone later to pull it out.
You know, I was raised by parents that considered the Americans as our saviors.
And that's why I'm so touched by you trying to find your ancestor's grave.
Because he died for my freedom.
I apologize for the mess.
I wanted to replace the old furniture with more modern things, but I didn't have the time to assemble everything.
Don't worry, I'll deduct it from the room rate.
It's IKEA.
Do you have IKEA in America?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
IKEA is everywhere.
It's like my boss.
The bathroom is across the hall, over there.
Dinner is at 7:00.
Today is chicken.
I've asked Martha, my housekeeper, to choose Cecile.
She's a nice, fat chick.
I mean Cecile.
Cecile is, not Martha.
Right.
See you tonight.
I was wondering, I couldn't find your Wi-Fi.
My what?
Your Internet connection.
Oh, no, no.
No Internet here.
No.
God is my provider.
Right.
I've selected a few books about the Great War for you from my library.
I know it sounds strange for a man in my position, but I'm very interested in war.
I don't know why.
But I'm sure you'll find them quite interesting and they could help you to locate your ancestor's grave.
Yeah.
Thank you.
All right.
I wonder, do you know in which battle he was killed?
No.
I only know it was in Flanders.
The American troops have never been here.
They landed in France.
He was English.
My great-grandmother moved to the US with her son after her husband was killed.
Oh, I see.
I was fearing you would think that Flanders was just a part of France.
Many people in the US make that mistake.
Yeah.
I'm a high school teacher.
So I'm not supposed to make those kind of mistakes.
Of course.
I should have known.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you very much, Martha.
Cecile, as beautiful in death as she was in life.
Good morning.
The...
He is in church.
Morning Mass.
I see.
- Eggs?
- Yes, please.
Is this decaf?
What?
It's like coffee, but without the caffeine.
We're honest people here, sir.
Oh, one's enough, thank you.
So, Martha, are you from around here?
Yes.
I've lived here all my life.
I know everyone.
So tell me, what do people do around here all day?
They work.
And when they're not working?
They...
They like football.
You know, with the feet.
They like...
TV.
They like...
I was wondering, is there a local pub around here somewhere?
Yes.
In De Zavelput.
It's three kilometers.
Say if you want more.
Hey, what's up?
Nice day today?
Let me help you.
That's okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What would you like to drink?
I'll have a Coke, please.
I'm Isabelle.
I'm Colin.
Colin Evans.
Yeah.
I know who you are.
Everyone in the village is already talking about you.
I only just got here.
Well, it's very easy to become a star in this town.
In the whole of Flanders, for that matter.
I thought you didn't understand English.
English, yes.
American, no.
He used to be my English teacher.
Yeah.
Until so-called "health problems" got me fired.
That's the weirdest pool table I ever saw.
It's very typical for Belgium.
It's a fun game, you know.
Really?
I'm actually pretty good at pool.
Oh, yeah?
Would you like to try?
Sure, I'd love to.
Do you want red or white?
Red.
Of course.
The color of aggression.
Pierre, leave him in peace.
And Coca-Cola.
So you line up the balls like this.
The game is very simple.
The one who first succeeds in pocketing his five balls in the opponent's pocket, wins.
We both start at the same time.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll count to three and then we shoot.
Ready?
One, two...
Wait, wait.
You first have to make a bet.
It's his first time, so let's forget about that.
No, no, I think we should.
I'll buy Pierre a beer every time I lose.
How about that?
Fantastic.
But I want you to have one, too.
Sorry, I don't drink alcohol this early in the day.
"Sorry, I don't drink alcohol so early in the day."
Fine.
I'll have one, too.
Okay, here goes.
One, two, three.
Nice shot.
Thanks.
So, do you work here full-time?
No, only during the summer.
I study biology at the university in Ghent.
What about you?
I'm a high school teacher.
That's why I have all summer to find that grave.
Yeah, I heard about that.
I think it's really great that you do this.
Well, family ties are important to me and my entire family.
One day, I want to be able to tell my kids where they came from so they might better understand where they're heading.
That's beautiful.
Two beers, please.
No mercy?
You don't look like the kind of guy that needs it.
A rematch after this one?
Why not?
Shall I walk you to the door?
No.
I'm fine, thank you.
Here, your keys.
No.
You keep the car.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You're still gonna help me find that grave, right?
Yeah.
I'm happy to help.
It's exciting.
- Sure you don't need help?
- Thank you.
I'm good.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hey.
Drink lots of water, okay?
Thank you.
That's very sound advice.
Come on.
- You're sure this is going to work?
- Yes.
But you must drink it all in one time.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How are you feeling?
Good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Wait, you still have...
- First time you're wearing this?
- Yeah.
- Well, it looks good on you.
- Thanks.
So what cemetery shall we go to first?
I don't know.
There's a lot of them, right?
Yeah, more than 100.
- Let's start with the biggest one.
- Okay.
So, where do we start?
These are really good.
You can't live in Belgium if you don't like French fries with mayonnaise.
Sure feels good to be out in the open.
This really reminds me of where I was born and raised.
Where was that?
Bearsville, New York.
It's near Woodstock.
Woodstock.
Wow.
Yeah, don't get too excited.
Nothing really happens there anymore.
Does your family still live there?
Yeah, but me and my dad, we...
He's always pushing me.
Ever since I was a kid.
It wears me out sometimes.
I hardly ever see my parents.
What?
Nothing.
It's just that
I thought you said family ties are really important to you.
They are.
They are.
It's just...
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to come across all gloomy.
Must be the country air messing with my head.
- Oh, God, is it 2:00 already?
- Ten past.
Shit.
I promised my granddad I'd join him at the club.
- The club?
What kind of club?
- A pigeon club.
- A what?
- He races pigeons.
He's really good at it.
I never knew you could race pigeons.
Well, it's a big sport around here.
Well, I'd love to see this.
Let's go.
Thank God.
I thought you wouldn't make it.
And I can't manage without my mascot.
He says I bring him luck.
Not that his birds need it.
So, you are the American?
I'm afraid I am.
Isabelle tells me you race pigeons.
Sounds very interesting.
Really?
Tell me, what's the thing that makes it interesting to you?
Just the whole concept, you know.
The whole concept?
- Jos, your turn.
- Okay.
Don't worry about my granddad.
He's always a bit overprotective when I...
You know, when he sees me with someone.
So he should be.
What are they doing?
Well, the pigeons all have a ring with all their data on it.
And that big guy over there, he scans the rings.
And from that moment on, the pigeons are officially in the race.
The birds are then put together in shipping crates and brought to the start of the race, which is,
Amiens.
That's in France.
How far is that from here?
About 200 kilometers.
Look.
That's Wittekop.
It's his favorite bird.
What happens next?
Tonight, trucks will take all the birds to Amiens.
And tomorrow, around 10:00 a.m., the birds will all be released at the same time.
Thousands of them.
The first one home wins.
A real champion dove can be worth a lot of money.
Up to 200,000 euros.
I'm sure your friend is not interested in the financial aspect of the sport.
Oh, I find it fascinating, sir.
I'd love to know more.
You should show him your loft.
Tomorrow I could make us a nice lunch.
We could all wait for the birds to return.
That'd be awesome.
Thank you.
I'm warning you.
It's boring.
He hates my guts.
He'll warm up to you.
You'll see.
So, are you ready for some more country air to mess with your head?
Sure.
This is a really beautiful spot.
I've lived here all my life.
But when my father died, my mom went back to Holland.
And I went to live with my granddad.
But the house is still ours.
I'd be heartbroken if anything would happen to this place.
Why would something happen to it?
Well, a while ago, there was this Belgian building company and they were planning on putting, like, a huge apartment complex here.
Luckily they ran out of financing, but...
I swear, I'd chain myself to a tree.
I'd do whatever it takes to save this place.
Why is it that everything beautiful has to be turned into a mall or a gas station?
Yes, David.
What have you got for me?
The construction company you're looking for is called Boulaert NV.
Where are they located?
Actually, not that far from you, in Bruges.
All right, set up a meeting with their CEO for tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.
And then book me on a flight to New York the day after.
You got it.
Are you coming to the party tonight?
What party?
It's to support our local marching band.
The whole village will be there.
You really should come, too.
Sure.
I'll be there.
Who's the guy in all the pictures with your grandfather?
That's my dad.
So he was a pigeon guy, too?
Oh, yes.
But Mom hated his pigeons because they shat on her laundry.
So he brought them here.
They've won a lot of races together.
The Barcelona Classic was their dream.
They'd just started to train birds specifically for that race,
but then he died.
In a car crash three years ago.
So is Jos coming home soon?
He is home.
He's in his loft.
Hey.
You ever hold a pigeon?
No.
This is Romeo.
How does that feel?
It's great.
It's great.
I can feel its heart.
It's racing.
Yeah.
It's because he doesn't know you.
You should talk to him.
What should I say?
Whatever you want.
Calm him down.
Hey, handsome.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you.
He likes you.
I will show you something.
What do I do with Romeo?
Put him back in his spot.
Look at this.
Take it.
So tiny.
Just into the world.
Pigeons grow very fast, you know.
In three months' time this baby will be ready to race.
You should give him a name.
- What, me?
- Yeah.
Maybe one day, he'll win a race for you.
All right.
Speed.
I'll call him Speed.
Okay.
From now on, whenever we see this bird fly, we'll think of you.
Wittekop?
That's fast, mate.
He's getting better by the day.
You think he's the first one?
Maybe, yeah.
We have to go to the club to see if he has won.
All right, let's go check.
Jos, last night, someone broke into Marcel's.
Yeah, all his pigeons are gone.
Good lord.
Is something wrong?
Marcel got robbed of all his pigeons.
It's horrible.
He spent a lifetime building those birds.
Marcel.
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
I'm Colin Montgomery from WFG.
I have an appointment with Mr. Boulaert.
Yes, Mr. Boulaert is expecting you.
Please follow me.
Colin?
If you see the...
You know.
The reverend?
Yes, reverend.
Can you tell him I already go to party?
Okay.
Will you come also?
I don't think so.
You must come.
Have some fun.
So you came.
I don't want to miss the number one party in Bunderzele, right?
Are you making fun of us, Mr. Evans?
Who's the singer?
I want to buy all her records.
Come on, big shot.
Show me how good you are on the dance floor.
Dear friends, I absolutely want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for showing up in such large numbers.
And I'd say, long live Bunderzele.
And now a golden oldie, a special request from our dear friend Martha.
The kissing dance.
What?
The kissing dance.
No, no, no.
No more dancing.
Oh, come on.
So what do we do?
We kiss.
Are you having fun?
Yeah.
Good.
Now you choose a girl.
Hey, what the fuck, man?
Let's rumble.
Leave her alone.
Idiot.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, it's just a little cut.
I haven't been in a fight since junior high.
You know, I was on my way to you when that guy stepped in.
Really?
Yeah.
Then you should finish what you started.
Wait.
Isn't this going to hurt?
I hope so.
Martha.
Hey, what's going on in there?
Come on, Martha.
Leave them be.
- No sex before the wedding.
- Come on.
Maybe I should go inside, too.
He's not going to get her up those stairs alone.
Do you want to meet up tomorrow?
After I get back from Ghent?
Yes.
Don't wreck my car, all right?
Thanks for letting me use it.
So I'll come and pick you up sometime after noon, okay?
Your lips are cold.
Bye.
Are you sitting down?
Yes.
The Sheikh just called.
Guess how much he's prepared to put in the fund?
Half a billion, right?
Two is more like it.
Wow.
The deal's going to make you very rich, my boy.
Now, you're on top of it, aren't you?
Sure, yes.
Get it done, get your ass on a plane.
Now, you're flying home tonight, right?
I...
Yes.
Good.
Shit.
I was just taking care of Speed.
Look how big he is, in just one day.
I didn't come here to talk about Speed.
I'm here on behalf of Sheikh Nayed.
Mr. Pauwels, I work for a very powerful financing group in New York.
The Sheikh is a client of ours.
You're wasting your time.
Wittekop is not for sale.
I know.
That's why yesterday afternoon I had a meeting with the CEO of Boulaert Construction Company in Bruges.
Our financing group intends to provide Bouiaert with the necessary funding they need to execute the plans they have for that beautiful nature spot near Isabelle's house.
You mean the Kleiputten?
Yes.
She's taken me there.
Believe me, I'd love to make sure that that site remains untouched.
But I can only do that if I can give my client what he wants.
I'll put 300,000 euros in your name in an ING bank account.
I don't want any money.
Nevertheless, it'll be there for you.
Always.
What if I told you to go fuck yourself?
Then I'd go ahead and break Isabelle's heart.
I would.
You know how much that place means to her?
She said she wouldn't let anyone touch it for as long as she lives.
And still you want to destroy it?
Let me put it this way, I wouldn't be standing here if I wasn't convinced that you love that girl more than anything in the world.
You...
You're a bastard.
That's why they pay me the big bucks.
Jos.
We're giving you a good deal here.
300,000 euros is a...
Shut up.
Shut up.
I...
I accept.
But I don't want Isabelle or anyone else to ever know.
I will tell them that the bird got lost during practice.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Sign here.
You had everything prepared?
Always.
Someone will pick up the bird later today when Isabelle's in Ghent.
Listen.
Here's my card.
Just in case.
Montgomery?
That's your real name?
Yes.
And that great-grandfather of yours?
Is he a lie, too?
No.
As a matter of fact, he isn't.
Well, then I feel very sorry for him.
Goodbye.
Please sign here.
Thank you.
Sir?
Excuse me, sir?
Do you want to take the call?
That was fun.
We should do this again someday soon.
Sure.
Bye.
Come on.
You know, we can't wait any longer, man.
We're gonna have to do it now.
It's your serve, David.
Look.
I've looked at the numbers and I'm saying we move now.
Are you going to serve, or what?
You know, that Skyworks deal isn't just going to sit there.
Look, I came here to get a good game in.
All right?
Now serve the goddamn ball!
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, darling.
So good to see you.
Did you lose weight?
Me?
No.
So how's New York?
It's okay.
Did you meet a nice girl already?
- Jeez, Meg, please.
- You stay out of this.
We didn't put him through college to meet nice girls.
Actually, I did meet someone.
A while back.
Really?
Yeah, but it got complicated.
You've got no time for complicated, son.
I know, Dad, better than anyone.
It's a lonely road to the top.
So you've told me, like, a million times.
What, is good advice not good enough for you anymore?
Forget it.
Remember you're only the man you are today because I pushed you.
I know.
I didn't have a father who held my hand and showed me how things worked.
Okay.
Mine was drunk half the time, barely knew my goddamn name.
I made sure you got everything you wanted.
Everything.
I don't have everything, Dad.
What are you talking about?
You can make more money in a day than most people do in a lifetime.
- So what?
- "So what?"
So what else is there?
Your mom said you were here.
What have you got there?
I was looking around.
Found some old photographs.
Look at you.
You're quite the rebel.
Oh, God.
That's not Mom, is it?
No, your mom was the one taking this picture.
- Yeah, right.
- God, I remember that day so well.
This girl in the picture here, she was your mom's best friend.
She came on to me, but I wasn't into her.
It was your mom I was after.
She gave me such a hard time.
But in the end, that day was the best day of my life.
There must be another one of your mom and me, 'cause I remember, we took it in turns to take the pictures.
My God, look at this.
My father when he was a kid, and my grandmother and her second husband.
What's this?
What?
Is it a letter?
I'll be damned.
It's my real grandfather.
I told you about him when you were a kid, but you probably won't remember.
I do remember.
I remember it really well.
He's the one that went to the First World War, right?
Yeah, somewhere in Flanders.
I can't believe you found this.
My grandmother must have hidden it, because her second husband was a real jealous guy.
Read the letter.
No, you'd better.
All right.
"My love, I only have a few moments to write this letter
"as we are called to the front.
"I am scared, but I am also determined to survive
"and come home to you and our baby boy.
"Because if this war has taught me something,
"it is that nothing in this life is more important
"than to be with the one you love.
"Yours forever, Stewart."
You know,
I've always loved your mother.
And you.
Always.
His uniform should be able to tell us more about the regiment he was serving in.
- Do you mind if I keep this for a while?
- No.
I think I know someone who can help us with this.
I'm very happy your father is not sick anymore.
I'm sorry I rushed off like that, without any explanation.
It's been a difficult month.
Not a lot of things happened here since you left.
Except for Jos, of course.
What happened?
He lost his bird, Wittekop.
Apparently it didn't return from a practice flight.
Jos thinks that maybe a bird of prey got it.
- He is very sad.
- Oh, yes.
He almost never leaves the house.
Luckily enough there's still Isabelle to take care of him.
I wouldn't know what he would do without that girl.
This is good.
Don't let it get cold.
The prodigal son returns.
Is Isabelle here?
Why do you want to know?
I want to talk to her.
I'll go get her.
Now get out of here.
Pierre, easy.
Pierre, stop it!
What are you doing here?
I came back.
Bad idea.
Can we talk?
I've got nothing to say to you.
- Isabelle please, just give me five minutes.
- No.
- Five minutes, please.
- Go away.
No.
Just disappear again like you did last time.
Without a word.
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean to...
Go away!
Go back to New York and let us be!
Now get going.
Okay.
But I'll be coming back.
Good.
I'll be waiting.
I heard you were back.
Recognize Speed?
He got big in one month.
Look at his feathers.
Beautiful.
Look at his wings.
I should start practicing with him, but...
Why did you come back?
I want to tell the truth to Isabelle.
You can't.
You promised you wouldn't tell anyone.
I have to.
I want her to know who I really am.
I want to make things right again.
Then get my bird back.
That's the one thing I can't do.
I didn't touch the money, you know.
- I know.
- So what's the problem?
Go and tell that Arabic bastard that he has no right to keep my bird.
He forced me into selling it.
He didn't force you.
I did.
Tell him that.
I can't.
I'll lose my job and everything I ever worked for.
I'm sure you'll find a way.
Not in this case.
The Sheikh has put a huge amount of money into our company's hedge fund.
Hedge funds only make rich people richer.
Exactly.
And they don't like to give things back.
You don't know if you don't ask.
Believe me.
I've worked a long time for these people.
They won't.
Then get the hell out of here.
And don't come near my granddaughter.
I'll break your neck.
You spoil me, Martha.
Enjoy.
Please.
Won't you sit with me?
- I must do things...
- Please.
Yes.
Because I can see you are sad.
You went to Jos?
- Yeah.
- How is he?
Like you said, depressed.
It will take a long time for him to forget Wittekop.
He was very special.
I don't understand.
I know he's a great champion, but...
It's still just a pigeon.
No, no, no, no.
Not just a pigeon.
What do you mean?
Wittekop is...
How do you say?
Not your real name, but...
- A nickname.
- Yes.
In Flemish we say "wittekop" to someone with blonde hair.
Like Jos' son.
His name was Tony.
Have you heard of him?
I've seen pictures.
He died in a car crash.
Wittekop was the first pigeon to come out of the egg after Tony died.
Do you see?
The whole village knows that bird.
We all know how much Jos loves it.
And when we see it fly, we think of his son.
Sorry.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the start of The Barcelona International, the most important race of the year, with 33,000 pigeons participating.
Attention for the start of the race.
Five, four, three, two, one.
They took off.
Try not to think about it.
Some more coffee?
No, I'm good.
Did you hear?
Colin is back.
Yes, so I've heard.
He came to De Zavelput, but I kicked him out.
Well done.
Why... did that asshole come back, for Christ's sake?
Darling, come back here.
Come on.
Give that to me.
I wasn't planning on ever telling you, but he won't leave you alone, so I'd rather you hear it from me.
That... asshole isn't called Colin Evans, but Colin Montgomery.
And he wasn't here to find a grave.
Instead, he was hired to convince me to sell Wittekop.
Here.
His business card.
Did you sell Wittekop?
- I had no choice.
- How so?
He threatened to have this financing group he works for, take over Boulaert and to build all over the Kleiputten.
Mr. Montgomery.
Not a lot of people have been able to track down the Sheikh all the way here to Euskirchen.
Well, I hope I'm not intruding.
No, on the contrary.
Oh, look.
Our pigeons are just starting their training.
These are youngsters.
It's their first time out.
Actually, the entire wing is full of birds.
The very best money can buy.
Please follow me.
Mr. Montgomery, how good to see you here.
Good to see you again.
This is Mr. Conrad.
I race my European pigeons from his loft.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hello.
You must be very good.
I do my best.
But the competition is very tough.
Would you like some tea?
Thank you.
I heard you were in Belgium.
Yes, I was visiting Jos Pauwels.
Interesting.
How is he doing?
Well, as a matter of fact,
I wanted to talk to you about something that concerns him.
If you will excuse me, I have to tend to the pigeons.
Seems to me your pigeons are in excellent hands.
Yes.
If only we could have better results.
I was wondering if we could talk about the pigeon I recently acquired for you.
I hope you found my gratitude to be sufficiently generous?
Yes, very generous.
Thank you.
It's just that I recently discovered that the ties between a fancier and his bird can be very intense.
Oh, yes, very much so.
That's why I...
I was wondering if you would reconsider Wittekop.
What do you mean, reconsider?
Mr. Pauwels really regrets his decision.
A lot.
I'm not surprised.
That bird is amazing.
And it's going to stay with me until the day it dies.
I have to run.
I hope you'll stay for the night.
Maybe I could use your advice in a few financial matters.
Of course.
- Is Colin here?
- No.
Why?
That's a pity.
You can't imagine what I've discovered about his great-grandfather.
It's, it's... just unbelievable.
That's Colin's great-grandfather.
He looks a lot like Colin.
And that picture was taken near the Cloth Hall in Ypres.
Do you see that truck in the background?
Look here.
That's the same truck.
Look closely at it.
It's full of pigeons.
That's a rolling pigeon loft.
Because pigeons were crucial to communication in World War One.
And the men who took care of those pigeons were called the Pigeoneers.
And now...
Hold on.
Here.
Now have a close look at what's standing behind that soldier's leg.
Do you see?
That's a pigeon basket.
Colin's great-grandfather was a Pigeoneer.
- Where's Wittekop?
- He's racing.
In the Barcelona International.
I want to talk to the Sheikh.
Now.
I want to talk to him now.
What's the matter?
What were you doing in my loft?
I tricked Jos Pauwels into selling Wittekop to you.
What do you mean, you tricked him?
I forced him into selling by threatening to destroy something very dear to him and his granddaughter.
- Does Mr. Walden know about this?
- No.
You have to give that bird back to its rightful owner.
Mr. Pauwels is heartbroken because of what I did.
I want you to leave the estate.
Right now.
Are you leaving?
Yeah, I'm going back to New York.
- No.
You can't.
- Why not?
Because I was looking for you everywhere yesterday.
I think that I know where your great-grandfather is buried.
- Do you know who Cher Ami is?
- No.
Cher Ami was a famous war pigeon.
He saved 600 British soldiers in the Great War.
It's...
It's an incredible story.
The British soldiers, they were lost in enemy territory.
And their only hope of survival was their last pigeon, Cher Ami.
And the Germans, they saw the bird take off and they opened fire.
And it was hit several times, but it kept on going.
And it arrived at the command post, one eye shot out, a bullet in his breast and most of the leg that had the message capsule attached missing.
But the soldiers were saved.
And Cher Ami, he received an Honorary Service Cross and after he died, a small statue was mounted in its honor on a little cemetery here.
And I'm convinced that your great-grandfather is resting there.
Good morning.
Could I speak to Mr. Pauwels, please?
What can I do for you?
Mr. Pauwels, it's an honor for me to meet such a great pigeon fancier as yourself.
I was wondering if we could have a word together.
You have already what you want, no?
That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about.
Come inside.
Would you like some sugar?
Three teaspoons, please.
I'm sorry to intrude in such an early hour, but I'd like to be back in Euskirchen when my birds return from Barcelona.
- Wittekop is racing also.
- What?
You're racing him in the Barcelona?
Why not?
You don't race a bird that comes from another loft over such a great distance.
- It will get lost.
- Wittekop can do it.
Who says so?
You'd never take the risk if you would care for that bird.
What is it with you people?
You think I'm a heartless person?
Yes.
You and your friend, Mr. Montgomery.
My grandfather is heartbroken because he has lost his bird.
I know that.
Mr. Montgomery has told me this last night.
He was with you, was he?
Were you two celebrating on how you fooled a couple of simple-minded Belgians?
Quite the opposite.
He came to try and convince me to return Wittekop to your grandfather.
He says you never intended to sell it.
Is that correct?
Yes.
It is, yeah.
He also says he tricked you into selling the bird to me.
He did.
What a fool.
He must realize this will be the end of his promising career.
He must care for you a great deal, Mr. Pauwels.
I'm not so sure that I'm the one he cares about.
Do you know where he is now?
No.
I kicked him off my property last night.
I'd go and look for him if I were you.
Where is she going?
She flies to the one she loves.
- Is Colin here?
- No.
He packed his bags this morning and left.
- Where to?
- Back to New York, he said.
I told him I think I know which cemetery his great-grandfather is buried at, but he didn't seem to care anymore.
- Which cemetery?
- Croonaert Chapel Cemetery.
- Yes, but where is it?
- Right here, in Heuvelland.
Do you want my moped?
Is this the grave?
Yeah, this one right here.
Stewart Montgomery?
I'm not the guy you think I am.
Yes, you are.
You're exactly the guy I think you are.
I'm happy to see you.
He's at least an hour and a half early.
Yeah.
He did a great time, but he flew to the wrong loft.
So he will be disqualified.
Then let's try again next year.
Do you accept my proposal?
Shall we work together in the future?
He can live here?
This is his home.
I know it's always difficult to determine the value, but the share price is the share price, Mr. Karadeniz.
What we can do, I'm sure you'll appreciate this, is offer you a fair deal in terms of...
AsI toldMr.Walden,
I'mnotinterested inprofitparticipation.
WFGneedsmy shares.
I grant you, sir, your shares are important for our overall strategy...
Jason, your wife is calling.
How are you, Mr. Karadeniz?
I'mnotselling for$ 18a share.
Oh, I'm not negotiating this.
This is Jason's deal.
We just need to give him a couple of minutes.
Which way to the bedroom?
It's over there.
Wow.
I love the view.
So do I.
Mr. Karadeniz, how are you?
AmI interruptingsomething?
No.
No, it's okay.
We're just...
Icancalllater.
No, it's fine.
It's fine, I assure you.
Asshole.
Everybody's sucking your dick about the Karadeniz deal.
Congratulations, you did it.
Thank you.
I've got a real big one for you.
Sheikh Abdullah Nayed.
Estimated capital, 10 billion.
Wow.
Erik almost got him to invest a half a billion, but now he's about to sign with Horizon Capital.
I want you to take over.
Get him.
Just start with the small shareholders and work your way up.
Don't worry about that.
Just get it done.
Mr. Montgomery.
Mr. Smith.
Thank you for helping me arrange this.
Useless.
This is garbage.
Who the hell did you use?
No.
No, I need real in-depth research on the guy.
Fast.
Deal with it.
Mr. Montgomery.
The Sheikh will see you now.
According to our religion, feeding birds and treating them well is a good behavior,
identified with acquiring merit in the eyes of Allah.
And it was a pigeon that helped Muhammad when he escaped from the Quraish.
I'm telling you this because I know many people find it hard to believe that a Sheikh could be a passionate pigeon fancier.
Well, I heard Mike Tyson does it.
That's pretty hard to believe, too.
When I'm with my birds, I feel they bring the best out of me.
I'm sure this is also the case for Mr. Tyson.
I've already told Mr. Walden that I won't be investing in your company.
I like the sound they make.
Isn't it soothing?
Very.
Have you ever wondered why pigeons are the symbol of peace, of love and good will?
Every time I hold them in my hands and look into their eyes, it's as if I understand exactly why.
To care for them, to see these noble birds race, makes me the happiest man in the world.
How do you race pigeons?
Do they fly in circles?
No.
They fly in a straight line back to their loft.
The most fantastic race in the world is the Barcelona International.
The birds have to fly over 1,000 miles to get back home.
Can you imagine?
That's a long way for such a small bird.
Indeed.
It takes them two days to cover the distance.
The Barcelona race is the epitome of endurance, the synonym of willpower, a hymn to love.
Love?
Yes.
Because the birds fly home to the one they've left behind.
They want to be reunited as quickly as possible with the one they love.
It's my dream to win that race one day.
What does it take?
The right bird.
And you don't have it?
No.
A very, very stubborn man named Jos Pauwels has it.
We have offered him a huge amount of money, but he doesn't want to sell.
Why not?
I don't know.
Where is he, this Pauwels?
Flanders, in Belgium.
Have you heard of it?
An ancestor of mine supposedly died there in World War I.
But let me ask you a favor.
Let me prove to you that you can trust us with your investment.
Let me get you that bird.
I told you, it can't be done.
Even better.
Let me show you that with hard work and determination
WFG can do what can't be done.
I'm very close to signing with Horizon.
Then I'd better act fast.

It's raining.
Again.
Welcome to Belgium.
Mr. Montgomery, welcome to Belgium.
Didn't get the memo?
It's Mr. Evans.
I've found lodging in the village itself, as you requested.
Great.
But I have to warn you, it might not be very comfortable.
Because the place I found is not really a hotel.
It's a...
A parsonage.
What?
The local priest is renting out a room because the Church needs extra money, I suppose.
But I can book you a hotel in a city nearby.
Everything is very close in Belgium.
No, it's perfect.
I want to blend in.
Okay.
Here's your Belgian cell phone.
My number is in it in case you need anything.
Great, thanks.
Voila,thisis it .
A very modest car, like you asked.
But we can change it, if you want.
No, it's perfect.
Turnback totheindicatedroad.
Yeah, yeah.
The indicated road is closed, wise guy.
Oh, what the fuck...
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Shit.
Excuse me.
Sorry, ma'am?
She's asleep, sir.
And without her hearing aid she's as deaf as a post.
Anna, Anna?
Time to go home.
Mass is finished.
See you tomorrow, Anna.
Good-bye.
She falls asleep every morning, before I even can reach the altar.
You must be Colin Evans.
Yeah.
Did you walk all the way from America?
My car got stuck in the mud a couple of miles back.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll send someone later to pull it out.
You know, I was raised by parents that considered the Americans as our saviors.
And that's why I'm so touched by you trying to find your ancestor's grave.
Because he died for my freedom.
I apologize for the mess.
I wanted to replace the old furniture with more modern things, but I didn't have the time to assemble everything.
Don't worry, I'll deduct it from the room rate.
It's IKEA.
Do you have IKEA in America?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
IKEA is everywhere.
It's like my boss.
The bathroom is across the hall, over there.
Dinner is at 7:00.
Today is chicken.
I've asked Martha, my housekeeper, to choose Cecile.
She's a nice, fat chick.
I mean Cecile.
Cecile is, not Martha.
Right.
See you tonight.
I was wondering, I couldn't find your Wi-Fi.
My what?
Your Internet connection.
Oh, no, no.
No Internet here.
No.
God is my provider.
Right.
I've selected a few books about the Great War for you from my library.
I know it sounds strange for a man in my position, but I'm very interested in war.
I don't know why.
But I'm sure you'll find them quite interesting and they could help you to locate your ancestor's grave.
Yeah.
Thank you.
All right.
I wonder, do you know in which battle he was killed?
No.
I only know it was in Flanders.
The American troops have never been here.
They landed in France.
He was English.
My great-grandmother moved to the US with her son after her husband was killed.
Oh, I see.
I was fearing you would think that Flanders was just a part of France.
Many people in the US make that mistake.
Yeah.
I'm a high school teacher.
So I'm not supposed to make those kind of mistakes.
Of course.
I should have known.
Ah!
Enjoy.
Thank you very much, Martha.
Cecile, as beautiful in death as she was in life.
Good morning.
The...
He is in church.
Morning Mass.
I see.
Eggs?
Yes, please.
Is this decaf?
What?
It's like coffee, but without the caffeine.
We're honest people here, sir.
Oh, one's enough, thank you.
So, Martha, are you from around here?
Yes.
I've lived here all my life.
I know everyone.
So tell me, what do people do around here all day?
They work.
And when they're not working?
They...
They like football.
You know, with the feet.
They like...
TV.
They like...
I was wondering, is there a local pub around here somewhere?
Yes.
In De Zavelput.
It's three kilometers.
Say if you want more, huh.
Hey, what's up?
Nice day today, huh?
Let me help you.
That's okay.
Hi.
Hi.
What would you like to drink?
I'll have a Coke, please.
I'm Isabelle.
I'm Colin.
Colin Evans.
Yeah.
I know who you are.
Everyone in the village is already talking about you.
I only just got here.
Well, it's very easy to become a star in this town.
In the whole of Flanders, for that matter.
I thought you didn't understand English.
English, yes.
American, no.
He used to be my English teacher.
Yeah.
Until so-called "health problems" got me fired.
That's the weirdest pool table I ever saw.
It's very typical for Belgium.
It's a fun game, you know.
Really?
I'm actually pretty good at pool.
Oh, yeah?
Would you like to try?
Sure, I'd love to.
Do you want red or white?
Red.
Of course.
The color of aggression.
Pierre, leave him in peace.
And Coca-Cola.
So you line up the balls like this.
The game is very simple.
The one who first succeeds in pocketing his five balls in the opponent's pocket, wins.
We both start at the same time.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll count to three and then we shoot.
Ready?
One, two...
Wait, wait.
You first have to make a bet.
It's his first time, so let's forget about that.
No, no, I think we should.
I'll buy Pierre a beer every time I lose.
How about that?
Fantastic.
But I want you to have one, too.
Sorry, I don't drink alcohol this early in the day.
"Sorry, I don't drink alcohol so early in the day."
Fine.
I'll have one, too.
Okay, here goes.
One, two, three.
Nice shot.
Thanks.
So, do you work here full-time?
No, only during the summer.
I study biology at the university in Ghent.
What about you?
I'm a high school teacher.
That's why I have all summer to find that grave.
Yeah, I heard about that.
I think it's really great that you do this.
Well, family ties are important to me and my entire family.
One day, I want to be able to tell my kids where they came from so they might better understand where they're heading.
That's beautiful.
Two beers, please.
No mercy, huh?
You don't look like the kind of guy that needs it.
A rematch after this one?
Why not?
Shall I walk you to the door?
No.
I'm fine, thank you.
Here, your keys.
No.
You keep the car.
Really?
Yeah.
You're still gonna help me find that grave, right?
Yeah.
I'm happy to help.
It's exciting.
Sure you don't need help?
Thank you.
I'm good.
Bye.
Bye.
Hey.
Drink lots of water, okay?
Thank you.
That's very sound advice.
Come on.
You're sure this is going to work?
Yes.
But you must drink it all in one time.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Good.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Wait, you still have...
First time you're wearing this?
Yeah.
Well, it looks good on you.
Thanks.
So what cemetery shall we go to first?
I don't know.
There's a lot of them, right?
Yeah, more than 100.
Let's start with the biggest one.
Okay.
So, where do we start?
Mmm.
These are really good.
You can't live in Belgium if you don't like French fries with mayonnaise.
Sure feels good to be out in the open.
This really reminds me of where I was born and raised.
Where was that?
Bearsville, New York.
It's near Woodstock.
Woodstock.
Wow.
Yeah, don't get too excited.
Nothing really happens there anymore.
Does your family still live there?
Yeah, but me and my dad, we...
He's always pushing me.
Ever since I was a kid.
It wears me out sometimes.
I hardly ever see my parents.
What?
Nothing.
It's just that
I thought you said family ties are really important to you.
They are.
They are.
It's just...
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to come across all gloomy.
Must be the country air messing with my head.
Oh God, is it 2:00 already?
Ten past.
Shit.
I promised my granddad I'd join him at the club.
The club?
What kind of club?
A pigeon club.
A what?
He races pigeons.
He's really good at it.
I never knew you could race pigeons.
Well, it's a big sport around here.
Well, I'd love to see this.
Let's go.
Thank God.
I thought you wouldn't make it.
And I can't manage without my mascot.
He says I bring him luck.
Not that his birds need it.
So, you are the American?
I'm afraid I am.
Isabelle tells me you race pigeons.
Sounds very interesting.
Really?
Tell me, what's the thing that makes it interesting to you?
Just the whole concept, you know.
The whole concept?
Jos, your turn.
Okay.
Don't worry about my granddad.
He's always a bit overprotective when I...
You know, when he sees me with someone.
So he should be.
What are they doing?
Well, the pigeons all have a ring with all their data on it.
And that big guy over there, he scans the rings.
And from that moment on, the pigeons are officially in the race.
The birds are then put together in shipping crates and brought to the start of the race, which is,
Amiens.
