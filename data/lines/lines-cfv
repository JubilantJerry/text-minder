A rock?
Yes, a rock.
This rock is made up of tiny little particles.
And these particles are the same as what we're made of.
If you look closely, even two different things, are made up the same.
I guess you're too young...
What a time for memory lane.
Three years later and I still haven't seen your manga.
Mom probably wrote to forgive you but I haven't.
Don't come home, you idiot.
Either way spells "idiot".
You sure you don't need your rocks?
No problem.
I gave up caring.
With your dad just passing away, we can't.
There's no better time.
Koino...
Koino.
I love you.
I love you!
Finally... the calm... came visiting.
Hey!
Oh no.
Oh no.
What am I gonna do?
What's wrong, Koino?
Pull yourself together.
I have to move out.
Huh?
My dad's company is in trouble.
I bought this place with his assets.
And the bank is coming.
So rent another apartment.
Oh, no, no.
What am I gonna do?
Calm down.
Relax.
I got fired yesterday.
You what?
With Comiket and looking for you, my sales figures dropped.
Your resignation makes us... very happy!
Fine, be happy then.
What?
You hate me. huh?
Happy are you?
Well, fuck off.
You've got savings, right?
Oh...yeah.
Yeah.
Here you go.
Oh, no, no.
I'm screwed.
What's this shit?
I'm in debt.
I ran up huge credit card bills.
And lately, I'm not popular.
Wanna see the fan manga BBS?
Die, die, D-I-E!
You suck.
No way.
I thought you were popular.
I lied.
Only my first volume sold.
Why?
Why lie?
Vanity.
But not the cute kind that normal people talk about.
Buying that lie is even crueler.
And this water?
Net business.
I heard I could make a fortune and cashed in my savings.
Ghandi Water.
It's rotten!
Rancid, huh?
It even looks fishy.
Didn't you learn anything in college?
So it's fishy.
But were you around to tell me different?
What's wrong?
You look pale.
Did you think I'd be a free meal?
So you thought moving in would be easy.
Okay, so you're disappointed.
I can read you like a book!
Move in with me.
I threw away most of my rocks so... it's more spacious.
Wow, so roomy.
Your manga ain't helping.
Without these, I have no value.
How much do you owe?
2 million yen.
You dingbat.
You think?
But there's still one more thing I haven't told him
I'm -
Forget it.
Get changed.
Nice timing.
Play rehearsal starts soon and I was worried about my shift.
You!
Hold on.
I'm her twin, Mejina.
Huh?
Really?
Hmm...
Old school art but the story's edgy.
I never thought you'd really do it.
Marimoda's entering the contest.
Top prize is 2 million yen.
I'll back you all the way.
If you win, we split the cash.
That's a scam.
Forget the cash.
I don't want to miss my chance to write again.
2 million yen.
Somebody lit a fire under me.
I'll write too.
And on paper.
The deadline's a week away.
I'll be tough to beat with my ally.
Just entering is no fun.
Wanna wager something?
Huh?
How about the loser has to obey the winner no matter what?
Now you're talking.
Risk gets me in the spirit.
I'm game.
Name your price, Marimoda.
If I win...
Koino is mine.
What?
What!
If you win, take back what is mine.
Hold on!
Since when's this been going on?
You bragged about not giving up on love or manga.
Beat me and claim both.
If you ain't prepared to do that, then quit!
But you've got an ally, right?
Marimoda!
He's...dead.
Huh?
You can pay your debts if I win!
You're whacked!
How could you?
White slavery!
That's what this is.
I won't lose.
I heard this sells big.
And I can draw this.
Who says so?
Kingo!
A seven year old named Kingo.
It's over.
I'm done.
For you, I'll draw manga again.
Give me the courage to rediscover love and manga once more.
Hello?
If I hadn't seen Mon on that day, I was deviously close to...
It's settled.
I'll draw too.
If I win, no harm done.
Koino.
I wanna try one last time.
But if I win, you'll do exactly as I say.
Get used to... cosplay forever.
Holy shit.
I feel so good.
I feel so good.
I feel so good.
Yes, baby.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, baby.
Y-E-S.!
THE END
I can't wait to see who won.
I don't have any confidence.
I know I don't have your originality or Marimoda's frames.
Formula romantic comedy... is all i can write.
That's not... entirely not true.
But, mediocrity has its place.
If I win, it'd be the best but...
Even if I lose, I'm fine.
But if you lose, it'd be horrible.
The worst.
And then, the best and the worst, came calling.
Top Prize
- Don Nlshlko "Sailor Suit Detective Meggy"
Runner Up
- Marimoda Den "Maharaja Shonen Goro"
Honorable Mention
- Aoki Mon "Kill Dad"
What gives?
I'll bust you.
Koino is mine.
Why'd that have to happen?
Rocks, scissors, paper.
Ready, go.
Open season on sluts.
Felt like the thing to do.
Oh no!
'Giba Ranger' is on!
This Giba will punch you like a brick
With these tusks turned fangs The universe rests on his shoulders
Mescaline Overdrive.
- Don-don-don
- Giba beam!
- Non-no-no
- My vitals!
Father's super-tinplated fake leather
Punch you like a brick
Metal machine bully Giba Ranger
Since when?
!
When?
!
For ages, forever.
I couldn't live like that working for that cheap ass company.
I have to make a living.
I have to increase my collections.
Sorry.
I'm sick.
You think so?
Certifiable.
I'm sick.
Do these Johns make you happy?
Well pardon me!
I need to do cosplay.
Without it, I can't do this job.
I'd have helped.
You'd have left me.
You'd have run.
Look who's talking?
You're here, right?
You're as guilty as me.
And two times now!
Fuck it.
It don't matter.
Either way, you're Marimoda's.
Marimoda w-w-won?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
See for yourself.
This.
I lost every damn thing.
You, my manga... so what if I came here.
Mon... hold on.
I...
Top Prize
- Don Nishiko "Sailor Suit Detective Meggy"
I wasn't talented at love or manga.
You escaping?
I win.
Nope.
We both lost.
Don Nishiko is Koino's pen name.
Here's...your rock back.
SEE THE WORLD
Why does it always end this way?
This ain't a freak show!
Yesterday was mistakes galore
Tomorrow too may be the same
Taking out this insurance... people walk ahead fumbling in the dark
But wish upon a star
Love is always extraterritoriallty
I'm crazy, busted up In love
An addiction to love makes you happy
For the time being... now... cry all you want but...
Open up to love's magic
Open your door to love
Open up to love's magic
Open your door to love
Or something like that.
Thank you.
After that, I got a loan off the money, paid my debts and got a place.
Marimoda returned to his job.
Everything was back to normal.
Except for Mon being gone.
Two weeks passed by like one year.
I'm Akashi Koino's father.
Welcome to the after party for the 9th Annual Sudan Manga Awards.
According to the winner's wishes, this is a cosplay party.
I'm Maetel.
I'm the Conductor.
Koino, I'm gonna get back on track.
Nothing's gonna stop me.
Congratulations.
I got a job at a sushi shop.
Take a look.
Amazing.
I found some old pictures of you in the move.
Looky.
Hey, It's Reversal Judge.
Your Honor, I object.
It's been a while.
My dad, mom and friends.
They don't know that I'm not here.
If I smile and wave, everything passes.
Reality slips right on by.
Reality slips through me.
Hello...
Goodbye.
It's just Mon whose gone.
Like some blessed invisible man my cosplay is empty.
I'm okay.
I'm fine.
I drank on an empty stomach.
Ms. Akashi.
I'm fine.
Please.
Here, take this.
Don't touch my girl, fat-ass!
Mon.
After that, I studied up on romantic comedies.
The ex-boyfriend comes back with this kind of timing.
Wrong?
Is that...cosplay?
We promised, right?
I arranged the rocks.
Looks heavy.
It calms me mentally.
But...not being able to ride the train was rough.
Mon, take a look.
A rock?
Yes, a rock.
This rock is made up of tiny little particles.
And these particles are the same as what we're made of.
If you look closely, even two different things, are made up the same.
So...
I can... meet you half-way.
A gift for reckless plot twists.
That's the true Noiko.
Koino!
Shit.
Koino!
Wait, wait.
This hill is dangerous.
Wait.
Go away.
Wait.
Please stop.
No, no.
Wait, Koino.
You're supposed to chase me!
Don't go breaking up on me.
It's cracked.
All of a sudden.
But Mon, look.
If we do this...
Wow.
A-A-A-A-m-a-a-a-a-zing!
Ripped by CrimSon66
A day and a half... nothing to eat.
To my name... 180 yen.
Six months past, not a day of work.
Over 20, never been laid.
Here I stand...
Lost in the road.
What the hell.
Even for me... the rain falls.
Or is it...
Shit?
!
I should have used oil paint.
Talk about rainy day planning.
Rock!
Good rock.
Your finger!
It's OK...
Maybe.

KOI NO MON OTAKUS IN LOVE
Rule 1!
Sorry but...
I'm in a hurry.
Rock... rock... rock.
Bread.
Take my bread.
M-map...
I gave it to you so...
M-map... m-m-m.
Map, my map...
Ouch.
That's what I call a hunk.
Rule 1!
As sensible adults at Tsugino Happy Inc., our "customer service and trust" motto makes... every day a "happy" day!
We're happy.
How happy?
Very happy!
Like we really could be.
You!
Part-timer.
Late on your first day, eh?
You've got some nerve.
I got hurt... and bandaged myself.
Not one iota!
Huh?
In the labor code about injury to part-timers.
And your poor boy face?
I can't help it.
I'm poor.
Cover your shabbiness before answering, punk.
I ain't paying you to smile.
Get to the warehouse.
Underground!
Hide in your hometown of Poorsville.
Part-timer.
Your welcoming party is tonight.
Get your mug in a "welcoming" condition.
TROUBLE MAKER
Rule 1!
Let me introduce myself.
You still reek of poverty!
Who'd welcome a face like yours?
Endure it.
You gotta eat.
He's not with it.
The name's Aoki Mon.
Occupation... manga artisan.
A comic writer?
Manga artisan.
What sort of comics?
Rocks.
Where's... that rock?
Rock manga.
Is the hero a rock?
I draw manga with rocks.
I get it.
You don't have to pretend you understand my art.
Art needs no explanation.
Enough fawning, you poser.
Sit your ass down.
Your time's up!
Ao-oni, right?
Ao-ki.
You've succumbed to substituting the word "art" for "failure".
If you were a success, you wouldn't be here.
But you are and it's killing you.
I'm no failure.
I'm just not selling.
That's called failure.
Get with the program.
POOR = FAILURE
You alcoholic pig.
The idea that selling equals success...
We average folks apologize for being part of the equation.
We won't deny the banality of your "not selling" excuse.
But your strutting around...
How's it feel not reaching a consensus with us ten?
Your tinge of shyness is a hope we'll pay lip service to your art.
Right Aka-oni?
The name's Aoki!
Gotta get a new job... again.
What's a quibbling bitch... doing with punch like that?
You said it.
- Uh...
- Uh...
- Loan me cab fare.
- Wanna drink at my place?
I'm Koino.
Akashi Koino.
I...
Could I... have lost my virginity?
What?
What?
Why?
It's so you!
Of all the guys, you're the cat's pajamas.
I thought you were Yunsung when I first saw you.
Yu-yunsung?
Now pose.
What?
What the hell?
No moving!
Here we go!
Now pose.
Pose.
Like this.
See.
What the hell?
Now with some blood.
And this... is the girl who made me a man.
Stop!
Stop it!
It tastes sweet.
Huh, I thought you drew manga?
He's a way popular game character.
Game?
First time?
I only played Donjara.
Donjara?
Fun, huh?
It'll wash out.
It's nothing to get depressed -
Handmade was it?
I put my heart into that character.
Three weeks of hard work... only to be barfed on.
For that...
That... amazingly wonderful costume, three whole weeks.
I'm not worthy.
I'm... no better than that quibbler.
You have your own important world.
And I pretended like...
I knew it.
The costume's not weird.
It's, it's ok.
Don't freak on me.
Don't freak.
Okay?
How can you ever forgive me?
Ms. Akashi.
Okay then.
Start by using my first name, okay?
Uh...
Funano?
Koino.
Koino.
Koino.
Will this do?
Not so fast buster.
You're right.
Of course.
Gimme a sober kiss.
Nobody does Yunsung cosplay like he does.
Is this the first installment on a payment plan to love?
But he's... not much of a kisser.
W-w-w-wait, Mon.
Koino...
Koino.
Last night.
We were drunk so we got hot and heavy but...
But this is too fast.
You understand, right?
Down boy...
Mr. Happy!
We'll hurt her feelings again.
Better wait.
Your time may come.
I'll go change.
We can only joke around in these.
You said it.
Mr. Happy... thanks.
He didn't push himself on me.
Like the others
You got a compress?
Compress?
I think I hurt my neck bowing down.
See the closet behind King Seiki?
King Seiki?
Get real.
Abe Seiki.
There's a first aid kit inside.
Ani-son King
Ani-son?
Anime song.
You don't know jack.
You really do love manga.
I can't tell people at work.
They're so ordinary.
Overly ordinary.
You collect lots of thin manga.
Clueless about "fan manga" too?
Humdrum.
Both inside and out.
I drew this one.
No-i-ko
Y-you draw manga too?
It's been my hobby since childhood.
I envied you when you said your occupation was a comic writer.
For me, it's just a dream.
Some dream?
How much did it cost to make?
600 copies for 150,00 yen or so.
150... 150...
One hundred fifty thousand yen.
Cup noodles, three meals a day for over a year.
All that money, for this frivolous...
I sold 800 copies at Comiket netting 1 million yen.
I've published 17 so I guess I'm 10 million yen in the black.
He ran.
He fled.
An adult, the same.

Aoki Mon From:
Your Father
What's with the bath towel?
Loser.
Big loser.
Hey, it's a cool bath towel.
More expensive than my pants!
Run!
Loser.
Bath towel loser!
My rock?
My rock.
Some sardine can, huh?
The size doesn't bother me.
How can I put this?
It's very eccentric.
You think so?
The plumber called it "Haunted Mansion".
Whatever gave him...
Thanks for my pants.
No problem.
I wanted mine back too.
And the rock too.
Did you find all these?
Yep.
You draw with them, right?
I wanna see your work.
You already are, in a way.
I mean, you're in my art.
What?
Rocks express a gathering of particles in the cosmos.
Each rock is a metaphor for the cosmos and its own work.
Their placement has special meaning.
So this room itself is art.
I get it.
Is someone playing along so funny?
She's heartfully pretending you know.
For example, here's a planet...
Manga.
I wanna see manga.
What in blazes.
He's watching me.
His pure face is asking for my opinion.
He's sexy.
What do I do now?
Where do I start with this manga?
It doesn't look like manga
Whatta ya think?
I knew it.
As a manga creator like me...
I'd like your opinion.
Like you?
Scratch that.
Find something nice to say.
Sorry.
Is my work that frightening?
No...
That rock looks like... my dead grandma's face.
Oh... really.
But... she was a nice grandma.
Grew organic veggies.
Sponge cucumbers -
Forget it.
I know my work is hard to appreciate.
You and your popular comics are more legit.
But someone out there understands my work.
One day... i'll make every one appreciate it!
You okay?
We better get to work.
No.
Koino.
We, we...
Not yet.
We haven't had sex.
Oh no!
Giba Ranger is on!
This Giba punches like a brick
With these tusks turned fangs
The universe rests on my shoulders
I'm not a happy enough person to sleep with someone I just met.
After a proper date and getting to know each other, we'll...
So...
I'm... still...
Testicle foreplay was the weak point of our sex last night, right?
Maybe it's time we rethought our routine sex style.
We're at that phase.
What phase?
Phase?
What the fuck!
I want you to get to know me.
So wanna take a trip with me?
If I go, will I really understand you better?
It's a true getaway.
A 'screw' getaway?
A 'true' getaway.
That night will decide... whether I can honestly date him.
Anime Image Club Honey 'Ho
If I was a chick...
Daily Pay. 28,000 yen.
Play Charge. 8,000 yen /60 mins.
Hang on.
King Seiki's Abalone Tour - 28,000 yen
For one fuck...
Either way it's cosplay
And 20,000 yen to boot!
Do I just want Koino's body... or want to date her?
Nothing in common?
We draw manga.
Big long shot.
Or a cosmic connection?
But... she's damn cute.
I gotta give her that.
Hey buddy.
Could you do your worrying someplace else?
You're scaring me.
Either way, I need money.
This is the one.
HELP WANTED
My precious.
Welcome.
Wow... amazing.
Manga galore.
Yeah, it's a manga bar.
100... 100,000 yen.
The writer sets the price.
I only lend the space.
"Atomic Buddha" by Aoki Mon 28,000 yen
A 'screw' getaway.
Aren't you in the wrong establishment?
No, far from it.
What will you have?
No, I'm not a customer.
Oh, the job, huh?
No.
I'd like to show my work here.
You a comic writer?
Manga artisan.
Are you now?
Get Rich Quick!
Can that money I borrowed wait till Friday?
Oh, sure.
No problem.
I'm tapped this month.
Don't worry.
My parents can help out.
I envy you.
Being born with a silver spoon.
It's not that silver.
You moron.
Unlike me, you can draw.
Be dad's understudy and learn Japanese painting.
Your status is guaranteed.
I don't approve of your scribbling.
Well, I don't think you're an artist.
Clinging to your low ranking art guild, drawing pretty stuff we've seen before.
You call that painting?
Mon.
I'm gonna create my own art form.
And it'll make me famous.
In one year.
No, give me two years.
You got a girl?
Huh?
I'm asking if you're dating anyone.
A highly... probably... candidate exists.
More than highly, nearly a sure thing.
If you really love her then quit making this stupid stuff and find a real job.
This...
Put this by the doorstep of someone you don't like and run.
Use it for that.
You!
This guy's a crack-up.
Self-destruction?
Based on that anger, this ain't the first time you've been told so.
Running away, Stonehenge?
The name's not Stonehenge.
You want money, right?
Or were you using this to get that rock?
Tear this up and promise me you'll make your girl happy.
Then, I'll hire you.
I'll throw in the rock too.
No way!
I won't give up my manga or my girlfriend.
Damn, I said girlfriend.
What the fuck?
Damn compress.
Hey!
Take this creepy shit home.
No matter how seeing him reminds you of your past... tread moderately with him otherwise he'll burn your bar down.
If he does as he pleases, then I'll do as I please.
There's no need to please Mr. Please.
My second escape today.
How pathetic.
Jesus.
Aoki-san.
You forgot this.
The bar girl, huh?
How'd you know my name?
It's on your work.
By the way, I'm a regular at that place.
Oh...
Sorry about this.
I'm Sono Kimari, an artist.
Just like you.
I see.
Thanks.
It really moved me.
Your work or manga as you call it.
My work?
I like.
Yep, simply love it.
If you desire my critique, give me a bell soon.
And Marimoda left you a message.
Show up for work tomorrow.
Marimoda?
Oh, the boss?
SEE THE WORLD
Well, good night.
I almost forgot.
What you said was cool.
"I won't give up love or manga!" Your straight shooting youth... but in a good way, really rocked my womb.
W-womb?
Bye baby.
B-bye baby.
A girl came by with a letter.
It's opened!
That it is.
Drop by my booth at Comiket next week if you can.
Comiket?
Co, comi, comiket?
P.S. I think I love you, Koino
Stop your bitchin!
You've probably never been in love, you virgin otaku.
That'll shut her up!
LATE PAYMENT FINAL NOTICE
Nobody does cosplay like this guy.
I gotta make him mine before the trip.
Hello.
Hi there.
Hi.
Noiko, you're late!
Hi Kiyase-san.
OK.
Open the doors.
Don't run please.
OK.
Thank you.
Guess he's a no show.
Sagara... san?
What?
If you're buying, then buy.
That's it.
I'm no longer your follower.
You're washed up.
I don't see the love in your work anymore.
Zero appeal.
Lame.
Lame.
Double lame.
So lame.
No gift for reckless plot twists.
You've done come and went.
Sorry you feel that way.
Listen hon, romance ain't more than hormones and brain synapses.
Stop bragging on the BBS and put that soul into your manga.
Get the fact that plenty of virgins are writing better work.
What's with her?
What's wrong, Koino?
Mon honey.
What happened?
Huh?
Your face.
This?
I started working at a bar, a weird place you can read manga.
Last night, some drunk punched me.
He did?
But it doesn't hurt so I'm fine.
You made Koippy cry.
Daddy.
We won't tolerate that.
Mommy.
What the...?
Nice flying act.
Sorry but you didn't look like Koino's boyfriend.
You and your crying.
This follower named Sagara upset me.
A "follower"?
My fan.
We call them that.
She's been stalking me with strange BBS messages.
When I refused her calls, she got pissy.
Someone you love to hate, huh?
But she said she's no longer my fan so I'll be fine I guess.
Are... you and your wife costume lovers?
Do you mind?
The term is cosplayers.
We've been to Comiket for 20 years now.
We're Ideon's Cosmo and Kitty.
Rivaling the hippies were the days.
The Harajuku boogie-woogie days.
We've got many booths to see so we're off.
And Mon.
Yes?
Koippy's not as tough as she looks.
Protect her for me.
If you make her cry, I'll punch you.
"Real Men, Real Fashion" 8,000 yen
Uh...
Mon?
What?
Selling your work here is fine but...
Uh-huh.
How about lowering the price?
My work is one of a kind.
Priced for my needs.
And that's the price of the work.
I made 20,000 yen at my job.
If I get 8,000 more...
We can go on the King Seiki Abalone Tour, right?
A mere 8,000 yen?
I'll lend you it.
Oh... sorry.
Thank you.
Can I bum your phone?
Oh, boss.
I quit.
He compromised.
I'm happy.
He's so down-hearted.
I'll give you the cash later.
I forgot.
I wanted to lend you this.
A King Seiki book.
You'd best prepare or you might be overwhelmed.
That's vintage!
Out-of-print and goes for... 15,000 yen on Yahoo Auctions.
I want pay back!
My stomach felt upset.
I felt sick.
No way.
I'll never buy your haunted manga.
I don't draw haunted -
I thought I told you!
Yeah!
Boss, please let me keep my job
No luck selling, eh?
I'll try changing the coloring.
The coloring ain't the problem.
It's the rocks.
Aoki, right?
Here's a rudimentary hint.
Try drawing with a pen and paper.
If it's promising, I could recommend you for the new talent contest I'm judging.
New talent contest?
Didn't I tell you?
I used to be Marimoda's editor.
Mr. Noro.
Editor?
So you're...
An ex-comic writer.
Didn't I tell you?
He was the hottest writer during Shonen Chop's hottest period.
That's old news.
If you were so popular, why then?
My hand went lazy on me.
Huh?
Don't be making fun of my hand!
When your hand goes, you'll know.
How much do you need for your date?
I don't wanna say.
I'll give you a week's pay.
Your emotions turn on a dime man.
But, give up the rocks and draw manga that sells.
Wh-wh-what?
You said it yourself.
You won't give up on love or manga.
Here's your chance waiting for you.
Thanks for coming to Seiki's Catch and Eat Abalone Tour.
Enjoy the full two days to your heart's content.
That was a super-duper banquet.
The tops.
The tops!
I thought that Evil Baron cast a spell for rain.
But the gods have answered Count Estrogen's request.
The tops.
The tops.
And the abalone at Ikaho hot springs is the tops.
The tops.
Abalone galore.
Ready or not... here we come!
Gobbledygook.
Giba-giba-giba-ban Giba Ranger
Giba-ban-ban Giba Ranger
This Giba punches like a brick
This is so great!
He's so cool, huh?
Yeah, he's...
I'm going insane.
real lively.
- Don-don-don
- Giba beam!
- Non-no-no
- My vitals!
Father's super-tinplated fake leather
Punches like a brick
Metal machine bully Giba Ranger
And now what we've all been waiting for... the ADR contest.
The part of Mescaline Overdrive, will be chosen at random.
Come on stage when your number is called.
Who will the lucky lamb be?
0-1-0-8...
S-s-s-seven!
Damn.
Damn it!
No way.
Mon!
Here!
Here.
Oh it's a boy lamb...
Well, rules are rules.
Get on up here.
Shake a leg now.
I don't wanna.
You get to read Estrogen's lines!
Hurry up.
Seiki's gonna get a hard on.
Oh, Estrogen...
No!
Ha-happy...
Thinking... of you...
D-d-die
Nooooo!
Noooo!
Nooooo!
Noooo!
Noooooooooooo!
Mon hon.
I'm sorry.
I know it was tough paying for this.
Uh-huh.
And forcing you to do the voice.
No worries.
But, you were so cool.
Huh?
Poor baby.
Too much stress I guess.
Sorry for pushing my hobbies on you.
But...
I love rocks.
I love you because you love rocks.
This is fun.
Rock!
So fun.
Here it comes.
Wow!
Oh, wow.
Rocks are the tops!
Thanks.
That'd never happen.
I still don't get it.
Maybe we won't work out.
You surprised me.
Don't peek.
Drawing flowers, huh?
Scattering them by the heroine is a romantic comedy standard.
Take that.
And that.
It's not popular now but it's a habit.
Besides, I like flowers.
You must really love manga to bring it on a trip with you.
Someday I'll take it to a publisher.
But, I'm an amateur.
A pro wouldn't do this on vacation.
For petals... if you do like this, you'll get more dimensionality.
You're right.
I tried copying your strokes.
Hey... you can draw.
Great.
You should draw normal manga.
Not now...
Sorry for all the trouble...
Mr. Happy.
Oh...
Say that line.
Say Estrogen's line.
Huh?
Please.
"I'm happy...
Thinking of you as I die. "
"I won't let you.
I won't. "
Nooooo!
No.
Come on.
The tops.
Mon honey.
I don't approve.
Failure.
Give it up.
Con-concentrate.
What's wrong?
My G spot.
Mon?
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
Abalone galore.
Don't sweat it.
Sure.
Why?
I'm going travelling, Mon
Wow!
Why me?
Lovely!
Is it the mountains or you?
Stop it.
You're one with nature.
Why do you love me?
Celebrate the body electric.
Stop it.
That was fun.
But why?
A shutter chance.
Some shutter chance.
Look.
Tree goblin.
What?
Goblin.
Tree goblin.
Get real!
Ah!
Sorry!
Sorry.
Life imitates... kid's stories.
After that, Mon vanished from me.
From that day, everything went haywire.
Actually, it started earlier.
In hidden places, it all went mad.
Now I could see it clearly.
Don't be dining and ditching on me!
I'll pay with my art!
It'll be valuable one day!
You fuckin' with me?
Get over here.
Get your ass in gear.
Over here!
Ouch!
You asshole!
I'm sorry.
Get over here boy.
Let me go!
I can't stand freeloaders.
If you don't work, you don't eat.
Got it?
Only risk-takers get to eat.
Free food is the origin of crimes disrupting our eco-system.
You'll learn that the hard way.
I ain't gay you know.
Pay up.
Money, money.
Let me down.
Hey!
Why am I hanging here?
Mon hon?
No, it's dad.
Something's happened.
Come in.
Thanks for helping me out.
No worries.
You can help me out.
Don't take that.
Wait.
No...
No...
No.
At least leave the wigs.
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
Help me, Mon.
Help me, help me.
Let the good times roll.
So this is the manga bar.
We're not open yet.
Excuse me, is Aoki Mon here?
He split taking the money I lent him.
Did he leave a message?
You're!
Are you Aoki's -
I remembered.
You're Den Marimoda, author of Maido Puttsun, right?
Do you know me?
Maido Puttsun
Ouch.
Yo, No. 15.
W-w-w-w...
W-w-what the?
Oh, Kingo.
He lives in there.
Is he yours?
That's for certain.
But the father is uncertain.
What's No. 15?
Nice meeting ya, Pops.
I had a smoke.
Felt like the thing to do.
What a blast from the past.
I loved Puttsun.
Wow, the first edition.
I recognized you from this photo.
You're a manga otaku, huh?
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
Why did you stop writing?
My hand went lazy on me.
Hand?
No, actually, the person who I wanted to read my manga vanished before me.
Basically...
I want to read your manga again.
I write fan manga under the name Noiko.
I'm sure you've never heard of me but...
This?
No way.
Collecting rocks ain't helping, No. 15.
Yeah.
You're right.
I wonder what Koino's doing.
That's enough.
For you, I'll draw manga again.
Give me the courage to rediscover love and manga once more.
Check this interesting message.
HI.
It's Kimari.
A performance artist in Amsterdam invited me over and I'll be gone a year.
Take care of Kingo while I'm gone.
What's with this chick?
Hello?
Sorry but can you turn the sign over, Kimari?
I'm her sister.
Oh, Mejina.
How've you been?
Don't confuse me space cadet Kimari.
I can't keep you two straight.
You look alike.
There was a guy here named Aoki, right?
Yeah.
Aoki?
Who're you?
His girl...friend.
That beer was delicious.
Yeah, real tasty.
Do you know what futility is?
Shut up.
Can you draw like this?
Here.
What's the big idea?
What the hell?
Draw like this.
Then I'll approve of you.
Target the youth.
Once you're popular, then be artistic.
Give it up!
I quit.
Don't quit.
Don't pay attention to what kids say.
I'm only telling you this because you're the best out of all 15.
Don't make me scream.
It makes me hungry.
You!
Some trip?
!
You haven't moved an inch.
Wait!
Hey Kingo.
Come over to my house.
Mom.
Cut the jokes.
It ain't funny.
It's Mejina, not mom.
Stop your running Mon.
Why are you running?
Stop it.
Stupid!
I'll never let you go.
On my trip, I made this.
Here.
And the other half?
I'm wearing it.
Mon hon.
Yeah?
Let's live together.
I can't be careless anymore.
Draw for me, Marimoda.
Draw.
What the?
Were you reading your manga?
Nope.
Yes, you were.
No, I wasn't.
Were too.
Was not.
Were too.
Was not.
You were.
Ok, so I was.
You nosy geek!
The new talent contest started.
The Grand Prix is 2 million yen.
How about sending in your work under another name?
We'll split the prize 50/50.
I'm exhausted from waiting at home for you every day.
Aoki...
Even if your manga sells, can you keep your love?
This time, youre mine.
Finally... at long last.
If this were a romantic comedy, the phone would ring about now.
My bad.
Iz 'e her?
His right side is totally paralyzed.
And your foot?
I sprained it.
How?
We'll tell you later.
Now look!
Still... my father, the painter, with those uneven lines...
He's still drawing.
Still trying to draw.
Can you do something with this line?
What happened that day...
I take to my grave, Dad.
Hours earlier, It was hard bone.
Was that what he meant?
Mon, take a look.
A rock?
Yes, a rock.
This rock is made up of tiny little particles.
And these particles are the same as what we're made of.
If you look closely, even two different things, are made up the same.
I guess you're too young...
What a time for memory lane.
Three years later and I still haven't seen your manga.
Mom probably wrote to forgive you but I haven't.
Don't come home, you idiot.
Elther way spells "idiot".
You sure you don't need your rocks?
No problem.
I gave up caring.
With your dad just passing away, we can't.
There's no better time.
Koino...
Koino.
I love you.
I love you!
Finally... the calm... came visiting.
Hey!
Oh no.
Oh no.
What am I gonna do?
What's wrong, Koino?
Pull yourself together.
I have to move out.
Huh?
My dad's company is in trouble.
I bought this place with his assets.
And the bank is coming.
So rent another apartment.
Oh, no, no.
What am I gonna do?
Calm down.
Relax.
I got fired yesterday.
You what?
With Comiket and looking for you, my sales figures dropped.
Your resignation makes us... very happy!
Fine, be happy then.
What?
You hate me. huh?
Happy are you?
Well, fuck off.
You've got savings, right?
Oh... yeah.
Yeah.
Here you go.
Oh, no, no.
I'm screwed.
What's this shit?
I'm in debt.
I ran up huge credit card bills.
And lately, I'm not popular.
Wanna see the fan manga BBS?
Die, die, D-I-E!
You suck.
No way.
I thought you were popular.
I lied.
Only my first volume sold.
Why?
Why lie?
Vanity.
But not the cute kind that normal people talk about.
Buying that lie is even crueler.
And this water?
Net business.
I heard I could make a fortune and cashed in my savings.
Ghandi Water.
It's rotten!
Rancid, huh?
It even looks fishy.
Didn't you learn anything in college?
So it's fishy.
But were you around to tell me different?
What's wrong?
You look pale.
Did you think I'd be a free meal?
So you thought moving in would be easy.
Okay, so you're disappointed.
I can read you like a book!
Move in with me.
I threw away most of my rocks so... it's more spacious.
Wow, so roomy.
Your manga ain't helping.
Without these, I have no value.
How much do you owe?
2 million yen.
You dingbat.
You think?
But there's still one more thing I haven't told him
I'm...
Forget it.
Get changed.
Nice timing.
Play rehearsal starts soon and I was worried about my shift.
You!
Hold on.
I'm her twin, Mejina.
Huh?
Really?
Hmm...
Old school art but the story's edgy.
I never thought you'd really do it.
Marimoda's entering the contest.
Top prize is 2 million yen.
I'll back you all the way.
If you win, we split the cash.
That's a scam.
Forget the cash.
I don't want to miss my chance to write again.
2 million yen.
Somebody lit a fire under me.
I'll write too.
And on paper.
The deadline's a week away.
I'll be tough to beat with my ally.
Just entering is no fun.
Wanna wager something?
Huh?
How about the loser has to obey the winner no matter what?
Now you're talking.
Risk gets me in the spirit.
I'm game.
Name your price, Marimoda.
If I win...
Koino is mine.
What?
What!
If you win, take back what is mine.
Hold on!
Since when's this been going on?
You bragged about not giving up on love or manga.
Beat me and claim both.
If you ain't prepared to do that, then quit!
But you've got an ally, right?
Marimoda!
He's... dead.
Huh?
You can pay your debts if I win!
You're whacked!
How could you?
White slavery!
That's what this is.
I won't lose.
I heard this sells big.
And I can draw this.
Who says so?
Kingo!
A seven year old named Kingo.
It's over.
I'm done.
For you, I'll draw manga again.
Give me the courage to rediscover love and manga once more.
Hello?
If I hadn't seen Mon on that day, I was deviously close to...
It's settled.
I'll draw too.
If I win, no harm done.
Koino.
I wanna try one last time.
But if I win, you'll do exactly as I say.
Get used to... cosplay forever.
Holy shit.
I feel so good.
I feel so good.
I feel so good.
Yes, baby.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, baby.
Y-E-S!
THE END
I can't wait to see who won.
I don't have any confidence.
I know I don't have your originality or Marimoda's frames.
Formula romantic comedy... is all i can write.
That's not... entirely not true.
But, mediocrity has its place.
If I win, it'd be the best but...
Even if I lose, I'm fine.
But if you lose, it'd be horrible.
The worst.
And then, the best and the worst, came calling.
Top Prize
- Don Nlshlko "Sailor Suit Detective Meggy"
Runner Up
- Marimoda Den "Maharaja Shonen Goro"
Honorable Mention
- Aoki Mon "Kill Dad"
What gives?
I'll bust you.
Koino is mine.
Why'd that have to happen?
Rocks, scissors, paper.
Ready, go.
Open season on sluts.
Felt like the thing to do.
Oh no!
Giba Ranger is on!
This Giba will punch you like a brick
With these tusks turned fangs The universe rests on his shoulders
Mescaline Overdrive.
- Don-don-don
- Giba beam!
- Non-no-no
- My vitals!
Father's super-tinplated fake leather
Punch you like a brick
Metal machine bully Giba Ranger
Since when?
!
When?
!
For ages, forever.
I couldn't live like that working for that cheap ass company.
I have to make a living.
I have to increase my collections.
Sorry.
I'm sick.
You think so?
Certifiable.
I'm sick.
Do these Johns make you happy?
Well pardon me!
I need to do cosplay.
Without it, I can't do this job.
I'd have helped.
You'd have left me.
You'd have run.
Look who's talking?
You're here, right?
You're as guilty as me.
And two times now!
Fuck it.
It don't matter.
Either way, you're Marimoda's.
Marimoda w-w-won?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
See for yourself.
This.
I lost every damn thing.
You, my manga... so what if I came here.
Mon... hold on.
I...
Top Prize
- Don Nishiko "Sailor Suit Detective Meggy"
I wasn't talented at love or manga.
You escaping?
I win.
Nope.
We both lost.
Don Nishiko is Koino's pen name.
Here's... your rock back.
SEE THE WORLD
Why does it always end this way?
This ain't a freak show!
Yesterday was mistakes galore
Tomorrow too may be the same
Taking out this Insurance... people walk ahead fumbling in the dark
But wish upon a star
Love is always extraterritoriallty
I'm crazy, busted up In love
An addiction to love makes you happy
For the time being... now... cry all you want but...
Open up to love's magic
Open your door to love
Open up to love's magic
Open your door to love
Or something like that.
Thank you.
After that, I got a loan off the money, paid my debts and got a place.
Marimoda returned to his job.
Everything was back to normal.
Except for Mon being gone.
Two weeks passed by like one year.
I'm Akashi Koino's father.
Welcome to the after party for the 9th Annual Sudan Manga Awards.
According to the winner's wishes, this is a cosplay party.
I'm Maetel.
I'm the Conductor.
Koino, I'm gonna get back on track.
Nothing's gonna stop me.
Congratulations.
I got a job at a sushi shop.
Take a look.
Amazing.
I found some old pictures of you in the move.
Looky.
Hey, it's Reversal Judge.
Your Honor, I object.
It's been a while.
My dad, mom and friends.
They don't know that I'm not here.
If I smile and wave, everything passes.
Reality slips right on by.
Reality slips through me.
Hello...
Goodbye.
It's just Mon whose gone.
Like some blessed invisible man my cosplay is empty.
I'm okay.
I'm fine.
I drank on an empty stomach.
Ms. Akashi.
I'm fine.
Please.
Here, take this.
Don't touch my girl, fat-ass!
Mon.
After that, I studied up on romantic comedies.
The ex-boyfriend comes back with this kind of timing.
Wrong?
Is that... cosplay?
We promised, right?
I arranged the rocks.
Looks heavy.
It calms me mentally.
But... not being able to ride the train was rough.
Mon, take a look.
A rock?
Yes, a rock.
This rock is made up of tiny little particles.
And these particles are the same as what we're made of.
If you look closely, even two different things, are made up the same.
So...
I can... meet you half-way.
A gift for reckless plot twists.
That's the true Noiko.
Koino!
Shit.
Koino!
Wait, wait.
This hill is dangerous.
Wait.
Go away.
Wait.
Please stop.
No, no.
Wait, Koino.
You're supposed to chase me!
Don't go breaking up on me.
It's cracked.
All of a sudden.
But Mon, look.
If we do this...
Wow.
A-A-A-A-m-a-a-a-a-zing!
Now, here's a tale you haven 't heard.
A tale no one's ever heard till now.
It happened once upon a time, not so long ago in a year when Christmas went to the dogs.
Nine dogs, that is.
The Nine Dog Christmas.
We begin with two dogs the all-time unluckiest, most misfortunate street mutts ever.
But something was about to change their world.
- Can you hurry it up, Tank?
- I can't hurry any faster, Snowplow.
Lousy holidays.
Christmas turkeys, Christmas ham.
Nothing but work for me.
Hey!
Thieves!
Vandals!
Help!
Police!
You ganging up on me, huh?
A fine affair, you lousy punks.
What?
It's just a couple of mutts.
Think I run a lousy canine café here?
Wait for me, Snowplow.
We gotta make tracks, pal.
The next time I see you is gonna be last time you lousy, mangy...
And a merry Christmas to you too.
Now that was a close call, huh, Snowplow?
Was there ever a scrape so tight I couldn't get us out?
Now, there's the life huh, Snowplow?
Look.
Nice, warm place to call home.
Two square meals a day.
Cool.
Careful what you wish for, Tank.
You have humans to deal with.
Little ones.
Kids, Tank.
Bunch of rug monkeys crawling all over you when you're trying to sleep.
I've seen a swarm of them cover a dog worse than fleas.
You ought to be happy with what you got.
I am grateful for what I got.
I am.
You see, I'm not grumbling.
It's just that my stomach is.
Maybe we got no home, but we got our freedom, pal.
There.
That's it.
That's when it changed.
And that is where our story truly begins.
Where are we, Snowplow?
We're together, Tank.
That's where.
Together's cool, but this place gives me the creeps.
Easy, pal.
- Call me when it's over.
- All right...
Amigos!
Welcome to Pierre La Rond's Traveling Circus.
Me?
I'm busting out of here now.
You can come if you want.
What, and give up show business?
It's not so bad when you're used to it.
We get two square meals a day.
- Least once a week.
- Yeah, fellas, this is living.
Okay, Frenchie, let's get this show on the road.
And so the two dogs had now become eight.
Mom, is it real?
No, dear.
Now, come along.
I sure hope Santa brings me that.
Do you think he will?
Can I ask him?
Well I suppose so, dear.
After all, it is Christmas.
Move it.
Move it.
We've got less than 48 hours to load up that sleigh.
Oh, I almost forgot.
There's another part to our story.
A quite important part.
And it begins here.
The man in red has a perfect departure record and as long as I'm in charge, it's gonna stay that way.
Understand?
Yes, sir, Mr. Buzz, sir.
Then let's move it.
Move it.
We can do better than this, people.
Get your backs into it.
We have to...
- Sounded expensive.
- Sounded like Agnes Anne.
What in the name of Kris Kringle are you doing?
Trying to put batteries in, sir, Mr. Buzz, sir.
- Elf policy number one?
- Batteries not included, sir.
Remember that, Agnes Anne.
Spit and polish.
Mr. Buzz has to see his self in those hoofs.
Yes, sergeant.
Dasher, did we sleep with the window open again?
Wouldn't you?
Smells like a barn in here.
It is a barn.
Oh, you too, Cupid?
Wow, you don't look so good.
That red nose looks like it's gonna burn out any second.
Oh, no.
Yes.
Very good.
Excellent.
Keep up the pace.
Excellent.
I'll fix it, sir.
Mr. Buzz, sir.
Just put it in a box and stamp it "some assembly required."
That's why he gets the big bucks.
Mr. Buzz.
Watch it.
This better be good, Number Two.
Yes, sir.
But it's...
It's not, sir.
- What?
- Not good.
No, sir.
Sorry, sir.
It's...
It's the reindeer.
You see, sir they got the flu.
Sir.
Mr. Buzz, sir.
Don't tell me it's the North Pole Flu.
Okay.
It's not.
But it is.
Oh, no.
No, sir.
Not gonna happen.
Not on my watch.
But...
But...
Took the words right out of my mouth.
Look at that nose.
That's...
That's trouble.
Wait a minute.
I've been through worse than this.
And how did I do it?
What did I have that nobody else had?
I had stick-to-it-iveness.
- What are we gonna do, sir?
- Replacements, that's what.
These aren't the only flying reindeer in the world.
But how?
Where?
When?
There's no time.
I'll handle it.
You keep the toys moving.
I'll need assistants.
A dozen.
Maybe two.
Your best workers.
Who can we spare?
We're running beyond capacity already.
All departments are staffed with emergency personnel.
We need everybody, sir.
Well, everybody except her.
Agnes Anne, you're reassigned.
To what, sir?
Operation Reindeer Roundup.
Follow me.
Hey, Snowplow, this crazy ride's making me woozy.
- I don't feel so good.
- Your boy's new to the road.
He'll get used to it when you're at it as long as us.
- Name's McGregor.
- Snowplow.
That's Tank.
Pleasure to meet you.
This one's Cheech.
Yonder is Q-T.
- The boxer's Chester.
There's Fetch.
- Hey, McGregor.
Hey.
- His name's No Name.
- Where we going now, McGregor?
McGregor, are we going home?
Are we, huh?
Are we?
Aye, my friend.
That we are.
He likes to think so, and we like to play along.
- Watch it, will you?
- He's fetching me face.
What's going on now?
Pierre's getting ready for the big performance.
Tonight, he shows off the new act.
The Flaming Leap of Death.
Now, that sounds cool.
Let's watch, okay, Snowplow?
I wanna see the Flaming Leap of Death.
- You it, homey.
- No dog'll do it more than once.
Always a new fella who makes the Flaming Leap.
And that'd be...
Hey, you brothers.
We'll be out of this fleabag business, Frenchie.
You'll see.
I'm gonna hit it big.
Dumb...
I'll be playing Vegas, like the fellas with the tigers.
You'll see.
Where is he?
Let me at him.
I'll give him a left upper lower.
So where are we gonna find reindeer, Mr. Buzz, sir?
Very simple, Agnes Anne.
All we do is...
Well, we simply...
We can just...
Well, we'll start right here.
Hello?
Sir?
I say, there.
Hello?
Can't you see I'm on the...?
- Who's that?
Who's there?
- I'm here.
What do you kids want?
Kids?
Of all the...
My good man, I wonder if you'd tell me where I might find some reindeer.
Try the North Pole, kid.
They're all sick.
You mean Santa's got no reindeer this year?
- Precisely.
- You're kidding me, junior.
I certainly am not.
Then how's he gonna bring the toys?
He isn't.
Unless I find some reindeer.
Why don't you check the yellow pages.
Yes.
Nine reindeer.
You have them?
Only eight.
I can live with eight.
Oh, and they can fly, right?
Hello?
Hello?
How will we ever find anything in a place as big as this?
How?
I'll tell you.
You just gotta be stick-to-it-ive.
- What have we found so far?
- Let's see.
Seven fish, two pigs, a chicken and a partridge in a pear tree and roughly zero reindeer.
I'm not letting the big guy down.
I know what they say behind my back.
They say old Buzz is past his prime.
They say it's time to hang up the elf hat and quit.
But I'll show them.
I still got fight in me.
I'll make them see.
My...
My glasses.
I can't...
I can't see.
I'll get them.
What was that?
Tell me that wasn't my glasses.
Oh, dear.
Ladies and gentlemen, children young and old welcome to Pierre La Rond's Traveling Circus.
Tonight, the most daring feat in all history.
The heart-pounding, showstopping, Flaming Leap of Death.
Hey, that's your cue, homeboys.
I'm not making no leap of death, flaming or otherwise.
Oh, Mr. Pierre can be awful persuasive when he wants to.
So who is the lucky sucker who wears this stupid outfit tonight, huh?
Get out of our faces, Frenchie.
You.
You're on.
Be careful, all right?
Pierre La Rond, world's greatest showman as he saw it, anyway, was no friend to the dogs.
And now, the Flaming Leap of Death.
All right, leap.
I said, leap.
I said leap, and I meant leap.
Watch the ears, pal.
No.
Imbecile!
Look what you've done.
Are you trying to ruin me?
Now, that was a real showstopper.
Ladies, gentlemens, children young and old.
Please, there's more to see.
What is that?
"Pierre La"...
Can you read it, Agnes Anne?
I would if I could, but I can't read.
Miss?
Ma'am?
What's that say?
That says "Rond," dear.
"Rond, dear." Rond...
Reindeer.
Reindeer.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
You're welcome, dear.
- How many are in there?
- I don't know.
- Eight or...
- Perfect.
But I don't know if these really are...
Of course they are.
I think.
They are a little small, and the colors are kind of funny.
But they're reindeer, all right.
Well, if the boss says so, then reindeer they are.
Come on, Santa's back in business.
Hello?
Anybody here?
We've got a first-class emergency.
We'll write a note.
Say we borrowed the reindeer.
The owner's gonna understand.
I'll say Santa will make it up to him.
Come on, Frenchie.
We've gotta find some suckers.
Or, as some call them, customers.
Don't bother me now, we got work to do.
What is...?
That's my truck!
Stop!
Thief!
Are we going home now, McGregor?
Are we going home?
Are we?
- I'm not sure where we're going, friend.
- But we're on our way.
North Pole?
Come on, we gotta get them dogs back.
We've never been on the road this long before.
I'm ready.
Let me at him.
Bring it on.
- False alarm, Chester.
- Go fetch it?
Whatever it is, old Fetch'll fetch it.
He chases everything.
- Where do you think we're going?
- We're going home.
We're going home.
Poor bloke.
Just don't understand.
This is our home.
The truck went on and on into a world they'd never known.
A place they'd never dreamed existed.
Mr. Buzz, are you sure we're going the right way?
We're on course, of course.
The North Pole is just over that hill.
Glad I found my spare spectacles, or it'd be the South Pole just over that hill.
So, what's your story?
Runaway?
Kicked out?
Why'd you leave home?
I never had much of a home.
You see, me and Snowplow, we've been on the streets since...
Well, going on forever, I guess.
Well, we get by.
Snowplow, he gets us out of all kinds of scrapes.
I had a home once.
A great house, fireplace big dog bed with deep red cushions.
They decided to move, but they couldn't take me with them.
Too much trouble, I guess.
Well, that...
That really stinks, huh?
I'll find another home.
Someday.
We all will.
Rope.
Chain.
Arc welder.
Salt and vinegar potato chips.
For me.
Padlocks.
If Santa went and dognapped them mutts they gotta be worth more than I ever imagined.
I'm gonna get them back, whatever it takes.
Still no sign.
Wait, somebody's coming.
It's him, it's Buzz.
We can bust out of here if we work together.
We didn't think you were gonna make it, Mr. Buzz.
When Buzz says he's gonna do a thing, he does it.
On the count of three.
Behold, not one...
- One.
...not two...
- Two.
...not three...
Three.
Are we home now, huh?
Is this home?
Is it, huh?
What happened to the reindeer?
Where did these dogs come from?
That's what I tried to tell you.
- These look like...
Like...
- Dogs.
Of course they look like dogs.
Because they are.
Dogs don't get reindeer flu.
If I brought reindeer, they'd just get sick.
Come on, you guys.
You know old Buzz is smarter than that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Sure.
Don't know what we was thinking, Mr. Buzz.
It happens.
Can they fly?
Can they fly? "Can they fly?" he asks.
Can they?
Of course they can fly.
You think I'm gonna get dogs that can't fly?
We gotta teach these dogs to fly.
Three thousand miles to go.
Frenchie, we'll be there in no time.
Right?
Hup, two, three, four.
Step to it.
Shape it up.
You can fly.
Remember, reindogs love snow.
Just think positive.
That's one way to get rid of the fleas.
- Oh, yeah, man.
That's cool.
- Too cool.
We are tough, oh, yeah, it's true We will pull that sleigh for you
Way up high on Christmas Eve We can fly if we believe
Sound off.
Sound off.
Hello, hello.
What's all this soft, fluffy stuff here?
It's called a mattress, Chester.
- I might never get up.
- Might not have to with the green gringos bringing grub right to us.
Good thing I didn't get it Super Sized.
Sure beats eating out of the dumpsters, huh, dudes?
You said it, Tank.
Come on, you worthless cur.
My pet goldfish could pull us up this.
Of course, I don't have a pet goldfish, but he don't need to know that.
Faster.
And on Pierre went, driven by the power of pure greed.
I did it.
Oh, yes, boss.
You did it.
Frenchie had nothing to do with it.
No.
Now it was almost within his grasp.
Fame and fortune would soon be his.
Higher.
It's gotta go higher.
For the elves, time was fast running out.
And there wasn 't a moment to spare.
Only one hour till liftoff.
We gotta get this thing loaded, pronto.
That's it.
Last toy.
Agnes Anne, time to harness the reindeer...
Reindogs.
Now, at about the same time, something else was going on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Agnes Anne went to get the dogs, but there were no dogs to be gotten.
Okay, everybody, let's...
Agnes Anne.
No!
Faster, mongrel.
Faster!
Move it, mutt.
My future's waiting.
Set a course for Las Vegas.
Things are finally going right for us, and then this happens.
Cheer up, guys.
Me and Snowplow never got into any scrape we couldn't get out of.
- Right, Snowplow?
- Sure, pal.
Sure.
So where we going now?
We going home finally?
Are we?
Where'd I go wrong?
What did I do?
Or didn't do?
Did I work them too hard?
Look it, Mr. Buzz, what if we taught some seals to fly?
It'll work.
Or maybe a polar bear?
A walrus?
How's that?
Agnes Anne, it's no use.
If Santa doesn't take off in 30 minutes, he'll never make it.
I can't put it off any longer.
I gotta tell him.
Gotta break the news.
There's not gonna be a Christmas this year.
This was indeed the darkest hour any elf had ever known.
Then something caught Agnes Anne's eye, something in the snow.
What...?
What is this?
These aren't Santa's boots.
The guy's got big feet, but not that big.
Dog prints.
Oh, no.
They've been dognapped.
Here, doggy, doggy, doggies.
Hello, puppy dogs.
I just gotta remember what Buzz always says.
I gotta be stick-to-it-ive.
I'll find them if it's the last thing I do.
And it just may be the last thing I do.
Get a move on, you lousy, lame mutt.
What you think I'm paying you for?
You're not paying me, you lousy, lame, good-for-nothing...
- Gee, I can't wait to get home.
- Aye, my friend.
We know how you feel.
I'll have none of this goofing off.
Come on.
Another 30 miles, and you gets your rest.
What do we have here?
"Wanted:
Dogs, new and used, for work in mines.
Will pay top dollar." My most favorite kind.
Now, Pierre La Rond dreamed of fame and fortune.
Secure the dogs.
And don't let nothing happen to them.
But it was fortune he really craved.
Fame could wait.
What's that, huh?
Is that home, huh?
Is it, huh?
- Don't know just what it is, my friend.
- Whatever it is, I don't like the look of it.
Aye.
You can tell good things don't happen around here.
You figure the guy will give us food?
I don't think we're gonna get anything from him.
Quit your whining back there.
Innkeeper, bring me grub or the closest thing you got.
Yeah.
You wouldn't be looking to sell a dog team, would you?
Maybe.
You looking to buy?
Maybe.
Name's Tiny.
I pay top dollar for good dogs.
- You don't say.
- I do say.
I need them for work in mines.
Hauling out ore.
You got any?
Matter of fact, I got eight.
And eight times top dollar, carry the three, less tax, plus seven...
How'd you like to make things truly interesting?
It don't get much more interesting than that.
I'm talking about a little game of skill.
Even stakes.
Double or nothing.
I ain't by nature a gambling man, but times being what they are I suppose a friendly little wager won't hurt.
What's keeping that dumb galoot?
I'm freezing my tail off out here.
Dudes, talk about chilling.
I live for this kind of weather.
You may, but I'm freezing.
Here, you can stand by me and keep out of the wind.
My teeth are chattering.
Mine ain't, my mouth is froze shut.
Don't get this kind of weather where I'm from.
How you holding up, Fetch?
Me?
I just...
I got one thing to say:
Hello?
Anybody out there?
It's them.
It's gotta be them.
Quit your bellyaching, why don't you.
So where is that dumb...?
- You know how to play, don't you?
- I was playing before I could walk.
Okay.
First bull's-eye.
My cash against your eight dogs.
Come on.
- Just warming up, is all.
- What do you say we raise the stakes?
Just a little.
Assuming you got something to put up.
I...
I can throw in the sled.
What else?
The lousy lead mutt.
He'll be fine working your mine.
That makes nine dogs.
That's all I've got.
What? "The lousy lead..." What in the name of the blue blazes is he doing?
All right.
Shoot.
Your boards are crooked.
What kind of scam you running here?
Shoe's untied.
Bull's-eye.
Them's the breaks.
Don't feel sad, pal.
You dogs are gonna love working the mines.
It ain't the dogs.
It's the sled I'm gonna miss.
No way this dog is gonna work any mine.
It's them.
It is them.
I'll have them back soon.
Man.
Nothing broken.
All I gotta do is get up and get out of here and...
There's only eight here.
Who you trying to cheat, pal?
Honest.
There was nine of them.
There's another one somewhere.
A mangy little thing.
If he thinks me, of all the dogs, for one minute...
Working in a mine...
Got another thing coming.
No way I'm going...
Help!
Help!
Help!
Oh, help!
Help!
Help!
I am glad I am not in her shoes.
You saved my life.
I don't know how to thank you, little fella.
Where's your home, fella?
You got a home, don't you?
No?
Well, then you can come live with me.
Just as soon as I find what I'm looking for.
There's some other dogs I lost.
Maybe you saw them.
Eight of them.
You know where they are, don't you, boy?
Can you show me the way?
Oh, please, boy.
I really need to find them.
Me and Santa need their help, bad.
If I don't get them back, there's not gonna be much of a Christmas this year.
Oh, please, boy.
Please.
Are you sure you can't help me?
Well, there's gonna be an awful lot of sad kids this year.
Doggies!
Here, doggies!
I'm going to hate myself in the morning for this.
Are you gonna show me?
You see, Santa, it's like this, more or less...
What I'm trying to say, in other words, so to speak as it were...
- I'm very busy, Buzz.
What is it?
I ever tell you how good you look in red?
Slims you.
Thank you, Buzz.
Actually, truth is, well the reindeer got sick, and we trained dogs to take their place but now they're all gone, and Christmas is doomed.
That went well.
Honest.
I don't know what's become of the little mutt.
I swear on me mother's machete.
Okay.
I'll take the eight of them.
Where's the key?
- I ain't got all night.
Hurry it up, will you?
- I'm hurrying fast as I can.
Well, what do you know?
There's the lousy little...
Run for it.
My dogs!
One last thing still stood between the dogs and freedom.
Say.
What's the idea?
You can't turn in on me.
- And after all I've done for you mutts.
- Gotta fetch.
That's far enough.
Somebody help me!
Aloha, boss.
Don't forget to send a post card.
And now there were nine dogs.
Come on, guys.
We gotta save Christmas.
Well, there it goes.
Guy works all of his life gives the job everything he's got, 24-7, and it comes to this.
One long career, and what do I got to show for it?
Nothing.
Nada zip, zilch, bupkes.
Zero.
But hey, I can't kick.
I had a good run.
It was fun while it lasted.
Now it's time to hang up the old elf hat.
Buzz.
All set?
You see, it's like this.
A guy has got a hat, 24-7, and what's he got to show for it?
- Come on, Buzz.
The sleigh?
- Well...
Truth is...
Truth is...
Is...
Truth is...
Well, of course, big guy.
What do you think, I'd let you down?
Couple minutes, we'll be ready.
I don't know how you did it, but you did it, and I love you.
You just gotta be stick-to-it-ive.
The nine stray street mutts looked strong and determined and proud.
It seemed their luck at last had changed.
I didn't think we'd pull it off, but it's going to be smooth sailing from here on.
Okay, Santa.
All ready.
Where's my reindeer?
These are...
- Buzz?
- Sir?
- Why are these dogs here?
- I'll explain later, sir.
Now for the last, final touch.
The elf Buzz covered them all with the magic of Christmas.
And not a thing happened.
Maybe you need a little more.
Sometimes, with some dogs, it takes a bit more magic.
Hey, Snowplow, what's happening?
On Dasher, on...
Wait.
That's not gonna work.
What am I supposed to say?
What about, "mush"?
Now, a dog can do many things, but it is not in his nature to fly.
A dog, as a rule, likes its four paws planted firmly on the ground.
Is it over?
Not yet.
We did it.
We're flying.
I can hardly believe my own eyes.
They're up!
No, they're down.
Oh, no, no, they're up.
They're down.
- Please, please, please.
- Oh, no.
They're down.
- Yes!
- Yeah!
And indeed, they had made it.
After all their trials, all the hardship, they had most certainly made it.
Always knew old Buzz could pull it off.
That's why he gets the big bucks.
Three cheers for Mr. Buzz.
Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!
Never could have done it without this one.
Hip, hip, hooray for Agnes Anne!
The nine dogs were out flying through the night and Santa was back in business.
Nine dogs flew that Christmas Eve.
For the first and only time, nine dogs brought Christmas to the world.
Hey.
Hold on, man.
What gives?
What'd I do wrong?
I'm innocent, I tell you.
I was set up!
I was!
Hey.
Nice.
Would you look at that?
Says, "Cheech."
Cheech, meaning me.
Come along now, little fella.
Now, this is living.
So long, fellas.
We're home.
Hey, Santa, merci beaucoup.
Where am I going now, huh?
Where am I going, huh?
Where do you think, you great goof?
You're going home.
Thanks for everything, Snowplow.
I didn't do nothing, pal.
We'd still be dancing for our supper if it wasn't for you.
What's the matter, boy?
You worried about your friends?
Well, they've all got nice homes.
And I know, because I revised the list.
And checked it twice.
Come over here, boy.
There you have it.
Each and every dog with a home.
And the one called Snowplow, well, he finally knew this was a gift they had all longed for.
Worse than a swarm of fleas.
- Mom, he is real.
- Merry Christmas, kids.
Yo, Santa, got a sleigh problem?
Doesn't matter till next year.
Merry Christmas to all, and to all, a good night.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
And that's where our story ends with all our new friends living happily ever after.
The Nine Dog Christmas.
Subtitles by SDI Media Group
[ENGLISH]
NARRATOR:
Now, here's a tale you haven 't heard.
A tale no one's ever heard till now.
It happened once upon a time, not so long ago in a year when Christmas went to the dogs.
Nine dogs, that is.
The Nine Dog Christmas.
We begin with two dogs the all-time unluckiest, most misfortunate street mutts ever.
But something was about to change their world.
SNOWPLOW:
Can you hurry it up, Tank?
TANK:
I can't hurry any faster.
BUTCHER:
Lousy holidays.
Christmas turkeys, Christmas ham.
Nothing but work for me.
[SNOWPLOW HOWLS]
TANK:
Hey!
BUTCHER:
Thieves!
Vandals!
Help!
Police!
You ganging up on me, huh?
A fine affair, you lousy punks.
What?
It's just a couple of mutts.
Think I run a lousy canine café here?
TANK:
Wait for me, Snowplow.
Whoa!
We gotta make tracks, pal.
The next time I see you is gonna be last time you lousy, mangy...
[HORN HONKING]
And a merry Christmas to you too.
TANK:
Whoa!
Now that was a close call, huh, Snowplow?
Was there ever a scrape so tight I couldn't get us out?
[POODLE BARKING]
TANK:
Now, there's the life huh, Snowplow?
Look.
Nice, warm place to call home.
Two square meals a day.
Cool.
Careful what you wish for, Tank.
You have humans to deal with.
Little ones.
Kids, Tank.
Bunch of rug monkeys crawling all over you when you're trying to sleep.
I've seen a swarm of them cover a dog worse than fleas.
You ought to be happy with what you got.
[KID LAUGHING]
I am grateful for what I got.
I am.
You see, I'm not grumbling.
It's just that my stomach is.
Maybe we got no home, but we got our freedom, pal.
NARRATOR:
There.
That's it.
That's when it changed.
And that is where our story truly begins.
Wooh!
Where are we, Snowplow?
We're together, Tank.
That's where.
TANK:
Together's cool, but this place gives me the creeps.
SNOWPLOW:
Easy, pal.
- Call me when it's over.
- All right...
Amigos!
Welcome to Pierre La Rond's Traveling Circus.
Me?
I'm busting out of here now.
You can come if you want.
What, and give up show business?
It's not so bad when you're used to it.
We get two square meals a day.
- Least once a week.
- Yeah, fellas, this is living.
[PIERRE LAUGHING]
PIERRE:
Okay, Frenchie, let's get this show on the road.
NARRATOR:
And so the two dogs had now become eight.
GIRL:
Oh!
Mom, is it real?
WOMAN:
No, dear.
Now, come along.
I sure hope Santa brings me that.
Do you think he will?
Can I ask him?
WOMAN:
Well I suppose so, dear.
After all, it is Christmas.
MR. BUZZ:
Move it.
Move it.
We've got less than 48 hours to load up that sleigh.
NARRATOR:
Oh, I almost forgot.
There's another part to our story.
A quite important part.
And it begins here.
The man in red has a perfect departure record and as long as I'm in charge, it's gonna stay that way.
Understand?
ALL:
Yes, sir, Mr. Buzz, sir.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Then let's move it.
Move it.
[TRAIN WHISTLING]
[SINGING]
We can do better than this, people.
Get your backs into it.
We have to...
[GLASS SHATTERING]
- Sounded expensive.
- Sounded like Agnes Anne.
What in the name of Kris Kringle are you doing?
Trying to put batteries in, sir, Mr. Buzz, sir.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
- Elf policy number one?
ALL:
Batteries not included, sir.
MR. BUZZ:
Remember that, Agnes Anne.
NUMBER TWO:
Spit and polish.
Mr. Buzz has to see his self in those hoofs.
Yes, sergeant.
[DASHER SNEEZES]
Dasher, did we sleep with the window open again?
Wouldn't you?
Smells like a barn in here.
It is a barn.
[SNEEZES]
Oh, you too, Cupid?
Wow, you don't look so good.
That red nose looks like it's gonna burn out any second.
[REINDEER COUGHING SNEEZING]
Oh, no.
Yes.
Very good.
Excellent.
Keep up the pace.
Excellent.
AGNES:
I'll fix it, sir.
Mr. Buzz, sir.
Just put it in a box and stamp it "some assembly required."
That's why he gets the big bucks.
NUMBER TWO:
Mr. Buzz.
Watch it.
[CLATTERING]
Uh-oh.
This better be good, Number Two.
Yes, sir.
But it's...
It's not, sir.
- What?
- Not good.
No, sir.
Sorry, sir.
It's...
It's the reindeer.
You see, sir they got the flu.
Sir.
Mr. Buzz, sir.
Don't tell me it's the North Pole Flu.
Okay.
It's not.
But it is.
Oh, no.
No, sir.
Not gonna happen.
Not on my watch.
[REINDEER COUGHING SNEEZING]
But...
But...
[STAMMERING]
Took the words right out of my mouth.
Look at that nose.
That's...
That's trouble.
Wait a minute.
I've been through worse than this.
And how did I do it?
What did I have that nobody else had?
I had stick-to-it-iveness.
NUMBER TWO:
What are we gonna do, sir?
Replacements, that's what.
These aren't the only flying reindeer in the world.
But how?
Where?
When?
There's no time.
I'll handle it.
You keep the toys moving.
I'll need assistants.
A dozen.
Maybe two.
Your best workers.
Who can we spare?
We're running beyond capacity already.
All departments are staffed with emergency personnel.
We need everybody, sir.
AGNES:
Whoa!
Well, everybody except her.
Agnes Anne, you're reassigned.
To what, sir?
Operation Reindeer Roundup.
Follow me.
TANK:
Hey, Snowplow, this crazy ride's making me woozy.
- I don't feel so good.
MCGREGOR:
Your boy's new to the road.
He'll get used to it when you're at it as long as us.
- Name's McGregor.
- Snowplow.
That's Tank.
Pleasure to meet you.
This one's Cheech.
Yonder is Q-T.
- The boxer's Chester.
There's Fetch.
NO NAME:
Hey, McGregor.
Hey.
- His name's No Name.
- Where we going now, McGregor?
McGregor, are we going home?
Are we, huh?
Are we?
Aye, my friend.
That we are.
He likes to think so, and we like to play along.
SNOWPLOW:
Watch it, will you?
MCGREGOR:
He's fetching me face.
[DOGS GRUMBLING]
What's going on now?
CHEECH:
Pierre's getting ready for the big performance.
Tonight, he shows off the new act.
The Flaming Leap of Death.
Now, that sounds cool.
Let's watch, okay, Snowplow?
I wanna see the Flaming Leap of Death.
- You it, homey.
- No dog'll do it more than once.
Always a new fella who makes the Flaming Leap.
And that'd be...
Hey, you brothers.
[LAUGHING]
We'll be out of this fleabag business, Frenchie.
You'll see.
I'm gonna hit it big.
Ow!
Dumb...
I'll be playing Vegas, like the fellas with the tigers.
You'll see.
Where is he?
Let me at him.
I'll give him a left upper lower.
So where are we gonna find reindeer, Mr. Buzz, sir?
Very simple, Agnes Anne.
All we do is...
Well, we simply...
We can just...
Well, we'll start right here.
MR. BUZZ:
Hello?
Sir?
I say, there.
Hello?
Can't you see I'm on the...?
- Who's that?
Who's there?
MR. BUZZ:
I'm here.
What do you kids want?
Kids?
Of all the...
My good man, I wonder if you'd tell me where I might find some reindeer.
Try the North Pole, kid.
They're all sick.
You mean Santa's got no reindeer this year?
- Precisely.
- You're kidding me, junior.
I certainly am not.
Then how's he gonna bring the toys?
He isn't.
Unless I find some reindeer.
Why don't you check the yellow pages.
Yes.
Nine reindeer.
You have them?
Only eight.
I can live with eight.
Oh, and they can fly, right?
[DIAL TONE]
Hello?
Hello?
AGNES:
How will we ever find anything in a place as big as this?
How?
I'll tell you.
You just gotta be stick-to-it-ive.
MR. BUZZ:
What have we found so far?
- Let's see.
Seven fish, two pigs, a chicken and a partridge in a pear tree and roughly zero reindeer.
I'm not letting the big guy down.
I know what they say behind my back.
They say old Buzz is past his prime.
They say it's time to hang up the elf hat and quit.
But I'll show them.
I still got fight in me.
I'll make them see.
My...
My glasses.
I can't...
I can't see.
I'll get them.
[GLASS SHATTERS]
What was that?
Tell me that wasn't my glasses.
Oh, dear.
PIERRE:
Ladies and gentlemen, children young and old welcome to Pierre La Rond's Traveling Circus.
Tonight, the most daring feat in all history.
The heart-pounding, showstopping, Flaming Leap of Death.
Hey, that's your cue, homeboys.
I'm not making no leap of death, flaming or otherwise.
Oh, Mr. Pierre can be awful persuasive when he wants to.
So who is the lucky sucker who wears this stupid outfit tonight, huh?
Get out of our faces, Frenchie.
You.
You're on.
[LAUGHS]
Be careful, all right?
TANK:
Yikes!
NARRATOR:
Pierre La Rond, world's greatest showman as he saw it, anyway, was no friend to the dogs.
And now, the Flaming Leap of Death.
All right, leap.
Huh-uh.
[CHATTERING]
I said, leap.
I said leap, and I meant leap.
Watch the ears, pal.
TANK:
No.
Whoa!
Imbecile!
Huh?
Uh-oh.
Look what you've done.
Are you trying to ruin me?
Now, that was a real showstopper.
[GIGGLES]
Ladies, gentlemens, children young and old.
Please, there's more to see.
What is that?
"Pierre La"...
Can you read it, Agnes Anne?
I would if I could, but I can't read.
Miss?
Ma'am?
What's that say?
That says "Rond," dear.
"Rond, dear." Rond...
Reindeer.
Reindeer.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
You're welcome, dear.
MR. BUZZ:
How many are in there?
- I don't know.
- Eight or...
- Perfect.
But I don't know if these really are...
Of course they are.
I think.
MR. BUZZ:
They are a little small, and the colors are kind of funny.
But they're reindeer, all right.
Well, if the boss says so, then reindeer they are.
Come on, Santa's back in business.
Hello?
Anybody here?
We've got a first-class emergency.
We'll write a note.
Say we borrowed the reindeer.
The owner's gonna understand.
I'll say Santa will make it up to him.
[HONKING]
Come on, Frenchie.
We've gotta find some suckers.
Or, as some call them, customers.
Don't bother me now, we got work to do.
What is...?
That's my truck!
Stop!
Thief!
Are we going home now, McGregor?
Are we going home?
Are we?
- I'm not sure where we're going, friend.
- But we're on our way.
[SINGING]
North Pole?
Come on, we gotta get them dogs back.
Q-T:
We've never been on the road this long before.
[TRAIN BELL RINGING]
I'm ready.
Let me at him.
Bring it on.
- False alarm, Chester.
FETCH:
Go fetch it?
Whatever it is, old Fetch'll fetch it.
He chases everything.
[THUD]
- Where do you think we're going?
NO NAME:
We're going home.
We're going home.
Poor bloke.
Just don't understand.
This is our home.
NARRATOR:
The truck went on and on into a world they'd never known.
A place they'd never dreamed existed.
AGNES:
Mr. Buzz, are you sure we're going the right way?
MR. BUZZ:
We're on course, of course.
The North Pole is just over that hill.
Glad I found my spare spectacles, or it'd be the South Pole just over that hill.
So, what's your story?
Runaway?
Kicked out?
Why'd you leave home?
I never had much of a home.
You see, me and Snowplow, we've been on the streets since...
Well, going on forever, I guess.
Well, we get by.
Snowplow, he gets us out of all kinds of scrapes.
I had a home once.
A great house, fireplace big dog bed with deep red cushions.
They decided to move, but they couldn't take me with them.
Too much trouble, I guess.
Well, that...
That really stinks, huh?
I'll find another home.
Someday.
We all will.
[DOGS SNORING]
PIERRE:
Rope.
[FRENCHIE BARKING]
Chain.
Arc welder.
Salt and vinegar potato chips.
Huh?
For me.
Padlocks.
If Santa went and dognapped them mutts they gotta be worth more than I ever imagined.
I'm gonna get them back, whatever it takes.
NUMBER TWO:
Still no sign.
Wait, somebody's coming.
It's him, it's Buzz.
[ELVES CHEERING]
We can bust out of here if we work together.
We didn't think you were gonna make it, Mr. Buzz.
When Buzz says he's gonna do a thing, he does it.
On the count of three.
Behold, not one...
- One.
...not two...
- Two.
...not three...
Three.
Are we home now, huh?
Is this home?
Is it, huh?
What happened to the reindeer?
Where did these dogs come from?
That's what I tried to tell you.
ELF:
These look like...
Like...
- Dogs.
Of course they look like dogs.
Because they are.
Dogs don't get reindeer flu.
If I brought reindeer, they'd just get sick.
Come on, you guys.
You know old Buzz is smarter than that.
- Oh, yeah.
- Sure.
Don't know what we was thinking, Mr. Buzz.
It happens.
NUMBER TWO:
Can they fly?
Can they fly? "Can they fly?" he asks.
Can they?
Of course they can fly.
You think I'm gonna get dogs that can't fly?
[WHISPERING] We gotta teach these dogs to fly.
Three thousand miles to go.
Frenchie, we'll be there in no time.
Right?
Hup, two, three, four.
Step to it.
Shape it up.
You can fly.
Remember, reindogs love snow.
Just think positive.
FETCH:
Ahh!
TANK:
Whoa!
That's one way to get rid of the fleas.
CHEECH:
Oh, yeah, man.
That's cool.
MCGREGOR:
Too cool.
ALL [SINGING]:
We are tough, oh, yeah, it's true We will pull that sleigh for you
Way up high on Christmas Eve We can fly if we believe
MCGREGOR:
Sound off.
[ALL BARKING]
MCGREGOR:
Sound off.
Hello, hello.
What's all this soft, fluffy stuff here?
It's called a mattress, Chester.
- I might never get up.
- Might not have to with the green gringos bringing grub right to us.
Good thing I didn't get it Super Sized.
Sure beats eating out of the dumpsters, huh, dudes?
You said it, Tank.
PIERRE:
Come on, you worthless cur.
My pet goldfish could pull us up this.
Of course, I don't have a pet goldfish, but he don't need to know that.
Faster.
NARRATOR:
And on Pierre went, driven by the power of pure greed.
I did it.
Oh, yes, boss.
You did it.
Frenchie had nothing to do with it.
No.
NARRATOR:
Now it was almost within his grasp.
Fame and fortune would soon be his.
Higher.
It's gotta go higher.
NARRATOR:
For the elves, time was fast running out.
And there wasn 't a moment to spare.
AGNES:
Only one hour till liftoff.
MR BUZZ:
We gotta get this thing loaded, pronto.
That's it.
Last toy.
Agnes Anne, time to harness the reindeer...
Reindogs.
[CLOCK CHIMES]
NARRATOR:
Now, at about the same time something else was going on.
Huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[THUD]
NARRATOR:
Agnes Anne went to get the dogs but there were no dogs to be gotten.
Okay, everybody, let's...
[GASPS]
[SCREAMING]
MR. BUZZ:
Agnes Anne.
No!
PIERRE:
Faster, mongrel.
Faster!
Move it, mutt.
My future's waiting.
Set a course for Las Vegas.
Things are finally going right for us, and then this happens.
Cheer up, guys.
Me and Snowplow never got into any scrape we couldn't get out of.
- Right, Snowplow?
- Sure, pal.
Sure.
So where we going now?
We going home finally?
Are we?
Where'd I go wrong?
What did I do?
Or didn't do?
Did I work them too hard?
Look it, Mr. Buzz, what if we taught some seals to fly?
It'll work.
Or maybe a polar bear?
A walrus?
How's that?
Agnes Anne, it's no use.
If Santa doesn't take off in 30 minutes, he'll never make it.
I can't put it off any longer.
I gotta tell him.
Gotta break the news.
There's not gonna be a Christmas this year.
NARRATOR:
This was indeed the darkest hour any elf had ever known.
Then something caught Agnes Anne's eye, something in the snow.
What...?
What is this?
These aren't Santa's boots.
The guy's got big feet, but not that big.
Dog prints.
Oh, no.
They've been dognapped.
Here, doggy, doggy, doggies.
[ECHOING] Hello, puppy dogs.
I just gotta remember what Buzz always says.
I gotta be stick-to-it-ive.
I'll find them if it's the last thing I do.
And it just may be the last thing I do.
Get a move on, you lousy, lame mutt.
What you think I'm paying you for?
You're not paying me, you lousy, lame, good-for-nothing...
- Gee, I can't wait to get home.
- Aye, my friend.
We know how you feel.
I'll have none of this goofing off.
[WHIP CRACK]
Come on.
Another 30 miles, and you gets your rest.
[PANTING]
PIERRE:
Whoa!
What do we have here?
"Wanted:
Dogs, new and used, for work in mines.
Will pay top dollar." My most favourite kind.
NARRATOR:
Now, Pierre La Rond dreamed of fame and fortune.
Secure the dogs.
And don't let nothing happen to them.
[GRUMBLES]
NARRATOR:
But it was fortune he really craved.
Fame could wait.
What's that, huh?
Is that home, huh?
Is it, huh?
- Don't know just what it is, my friend.
- Whatever it is, I don't like the look of it.
Aye.
You can tell good things don't happen around here.
You figure the guy will give us food?
I don't think we're gonna get anything from him.
Quit your whining back there.
Innkeeper, bring me grub or the closest thing you got.
Yeah.
You wouldn't be looking to sell a dog team, would you?
Maybe.
You looking to buy?
Maybe.
Name's Tiny.
I pay top dollar for good dogs.
- You don't say.
- I do say.
I need them for work in mines.
Hauling out ore.
You got any?
Matter of fact, I got eight.
And eight times top dollar, carry the three, less tax, plus seven...
How'd you like to make things truly interesting?
It don't get much more interesting than that.
I'm talking about a little game of skill.
Even stakes.
Double or nothing.
I ain't by nature a gambling man, but times being what they are I suppose a friendly little wager won't hurt.
What's keeping that dumb galoot?
I'm freezing my tail off out here.
TANK:
Dudes, talk about chilling.
I live for this kind of weather.
You may, but I'm freezing.
Here, you can stand by me and keep out of the wind.
My teeth are chattering.
Mine ain't, my mouth is froze shut.
Don't get this kind of weather where I'm from.
How you holding up, Fetch?
Me?
I just...
I got one thing to say:
[HOWLING]
AGNES:
Hello?
Anybody out there?
[DOGS HOWLING]
It's them.
It's gotta be them.
Quit your bellyaching, why don't you.
So where is that dumb...?
[MUMBLING]
- You know how to play, don't you?
- I was playing before I could walk.
Okay.
First bull's-eye.
My cash against your eight dogs.
Huh?
Come on.
- Just warming up, is all.
- What do you say we raise the stakes?
Just a little.
Assuming you got something to put up.
I...
I can throw in the sled.
What else?
The lousy lead mutt.
He'll be fine working your mine.
That makes nine dogs.
That's all I've got.
What? "The lousy lead..." What in the name of the blue blazes is he doing?
All right.
Shoot.
Your boards are crooked.
What kind of scam you running here?
Shoe's untied.
Bull's-eye.
Them's the breaks.
Don't feel sad, pal.
You dogs are gonna love working the mines.
It ain't the dogs.
It's the sled I'm gonna miss.
No way this dog is gonna work any mine.
[DOGS HOWLING]
It's them.
It is them.
I'll have them back soon.
Man.
Nothing broken.
All I gotta do is get up and get out of here and...
[POLAR BEAR GROWLING]
Uh-oh.
There's only eight here.
Who you trying to cheat, pal?
PIERRE:
Honest.
There was nine of them.
There's another one somewhere.
A mangy little thing.
If he thinks me, of all the dogs, for one minute...
Working in a mine...
Got another thing coming.
No way I'm going...
AGNES:
Help!
Help!
Help!
Oh, help!
Help!
Help!
[POLAR BEAR ROARING]
I am glad I am not in her shoes.
[BARKING]
[SCREAMING]
You saved my life.
I don't know how to thank you, little fella.
Where's your home, fella?
You got a home, don't you?
No?
Well, then you can come live with me.
Just as soon as I find what I'm looking for.
There's some other dogs I lost.
Maybe you saw them.
Eight of them.
You know where they are, don't you, boy?
Can you show me the way?
Oh, please, boy.
I really need to find them.
Me and Santa need their help, bad.
If I don't get them back, there's not gonna be much of a Christmas this year.
Oh, please, boy.
Please.
Are you sure you can't help me?
Well, there's gonna be an awful lot of sad kids this year.
Doggies!
Here, doggies!
I'm going to hate myself in the morning for this.
[BARKING]
Are you gonna show me?
You see, Santa, it's like this, more or less...
What I'm trying to say, in other words, so to speak as it were...
- I'm very busy, Buzz.
What is it?
I ever tell you how good you look in red?
Slims you.
Thank you, Buzz.
Actually, truth is, well the reindeer got sick, and we trained dogs to take their place but now they're all gone, and Christmas is doomed.
That went well.
PIERRE:
Honest.
I don't know what's become of the little mutt.
I swear on me mother's machete.
Okay.
I'll take the eight of them.
Where's the key?
- I ain't got all night.
Hurry it up, will you?
- I'm hurrying fast as I can.
[FRENCHIE BARKING]
Well, what do you know?
There's the lousy little...
FRENCHIE:
Run for it.
My dogs!
[BARKING]
NARRATOR:
One last thing still stood between the dogs and freedom.
Say.
What's the idea?
You can't turn in on me.
- And after all I've done for you mutts.
- Gotta fetch.
[CHOMPS]
[SCREAMS]
PIERRE:
That's far enough.
Somebody help me!
Aloha, boss.
Don't forget to send a post card.
NARRATOR:
And now there were nine dogs.
Come on, guys.
We gotta save Christmas.
MR. BUZZ:
Well, there it goes.
Guy works all of his life gives the job everything he's got, 24-7, and it comes to this.
One long career, and what do I got to show for it?
Nothing.
Nada zip, zilch, bupkes.
Zero.
But hey, I can't kick.
I had a good run.
It was fun while it lasted.
Now it's time to hang up the old elf hat.
Buzz.
All set?
You see, it's like this.
A guy has got a hat, 24-7, and what's he got to show for it?
- Come on, Buzz.
The sleigh?
- Well...
Truth is...
Truth is...
[DOGS BARKING]
Is...
Truth is...
Well, of course, big guy.
What do you think, I'd let you down?
Couple minutes, we'll be ready.
I don't know how you did it, but you did it, and I love you.
You just gotta be stick-to-it-ive.
NARRATOR:
The nine stray street mutts looked strong and determined and proud.
It seemed their luck at last had changed.
I didn't think we'd pull it off, but it's going to be smooth sailing from here on.
Okay, Santa.
All ready.
[SANTA HUMMING]
Where's my reindeer?
These are...
- Buzz?
- Sir?
- Why are these dogs here?
- I'll explain later, sir.
Now for the last, final touch.
NARRATOR:
The elf Buzz covered them all with the magic of Christmas.
And not a thing happened.
Maybe you need a little more.
NARRATOR:
Sometimes, with some dogs it takes a bit more magic.
Hey, Snowplow, what's happening?
Ho ho ho!
On Dasher, on...
Wait.
That's not gonna work.
What am I supposed to say?
What about, "mush"?
NARRATOR:
Now, a dog can do many things but it is not in his nature to fly.
A dog, as a rule, likes its four paws planted firmly on the ground.
[DOGS HOWLING]
SANTA:
Whoa!
Is it over?
Not yet.
We did it.
We're flying.
I can hardly believe my own eyes.
SANTA:
Ho, ho, ho!
They're up!
No, they're down.
Oh, no, no, they're up.
They're down.
- Please, please, please.
- Oh, no.
They're down.
- Yes!
- Yeah!
NARRATOR:
And indeed, they had made it.
After all their trials, all the hardship, they had most certainly made it.
Always knew old Buzz could pull it off.
That's why he gets the big bucks.
Three cheers for Mr. Buzz.
Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip...
ALL:
Hooray!
Never could have done it without this one.
ALL:
Hip, hip, hooray for Agnes Anne!
NARRATOR:
The nine dogs were out flying through the night and Santa was back in business.
NARRATOR:
Nine dogs flew that Christmas Eve.
For the first and only time, nine dogs brought Christmas to the world.
Hey.
Hold on, man.
What gives?
What'd I do wrong?
CHEECH:
I'm innocent, I tell you.
I was set up!
I was!
Hey.
Nice.
Would you look at that?
Says, "Cheech."
Cheech, meaning me.
Come along now, little fella.
Now, this is living.
So long, fellas.
We're home.
FRENCHIE:
Hey, Santa, merci beaucoup.
Where am I going now, huh?
Where am I going, huh?
Where do you think, you great goof?
You're going home.
Thanks for everything, Snowplow.
I didn't do nothing, pal.
We'd still be dancing for our supper if it wasn't for you.
What's the matter, boy?
You worried about your friends?
Well, they've all got nice homes.
And I know, because I revised the list.
And checked it twice.
Come over here, boy.
NARRATOR:
There you have it.
Each and every dog with a home.
And the one called Snowplow, well, he finally knew this was a gift they had all longed for.
SNOWPLOW:
Worse than a swarm of fleas.
- Mom, he is real.
MOTHER:
Merry Christmas, kids.
MAN:
Yo, Santa, got a sleigh problem?
Doesn't matter till next year.
Merry Christmas to all, and to all, a good night.
Merry Christmas!
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!
NARRATOR:
And that's where our story ends with all our new friends living happily ever after.
The Nine Dog Christmas.

WHEN I FIRST COME ON YOU IN THE WOODS,
ALL YOU COULD SAY WAS, "I APOLOGIZE."
BEFORE YOU EXHIBIT YOUR JOHNSON, I'M GONNA SEE TO THIS FELLA.

GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

NOW I'M GONNA LAY THIS CLOTH ON YOUR FUCKIN' LIPS.

WAIT, WAIT IN HERE, WITH TRIXIE.
I'LL JUST BE A MOMENT.
THAT WIDOW AIN'T HIGH.
MAYBE WAITING TILL AFTER THE SERVICE.
WHEN SHE'D WANNA GET GOOD AND FUCKING LOADED IS BEFORE THE FUCKING SERVICE,
AGAINST ALL THE FUCKING CARRYING ON.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- MAKES SENSE.
MEANING ALL THAT WHORE'S BEEN TELLING ME THE LAST 10 FUCKING DAYS
ABOUT SEEING THE WIDOW TAKING THE DOPE, AND YOUR OWN FUCKING ASSURANCES,
YOU VERIFY THAT SHE'S LOADED PERSONALLY
- YOU'RE BOTH FULL OF SHIT.
I CHECKED IN ON THE WOMAN DAILY.
IF I WAS FOOLED, PERHAPS I'VE CHOSEN SIMPLEMINDEDNESS, AL,
OVER REALIZING A CERTAIN FRIEND
HAS USED ME AS AN INSTRUMENT OF PURPOSES HE CONCEALED.
SAY WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY,
OR PREPARE FOR ETERNAL FUCKING SILENCE.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU COMMISSIONED ME
TO MAKE AN OFFER ON THE WIDOW'S CLAIM
TO KEEP THE REGULATORS OFF YOU, AL.
I THINK SOMEONE FOUND SOMETHING OUT THERE YOU WANT.
ASSUME YOU AIN'T BEEN PRIVY
TO THE INS AND OUTS OF THAT MATTER
FOR THE SAKE OF FUCKING CONVERSATION, HUH?
I MEAN, WAS I ASLEEP, E.B.,
WHEN YOU AND ME DECLARED UNDYING LOYALTY
AND FULL FAITH MUTUAL DISCLOSURE
ABOUT EVERY FUCKING DETAIL OF EVERY FUCKING MOVE

- YOU USED ME AS A PAWN, AL.
AND YOU FUCKED UP THE GAME IS THE CENTRAL FUCKING PRESENT ISSUE.
WE AGREED ON 2,000.
YOU WANT A FUCKING PERCENTAGE INSTEAD?
IS THAT SUCH AN INCONCEIVABLE PROPOSITION?
- YEAH, YOU GOT A PERCENTAGE, E.B.
- HOW BIG?
TWO PERCENT OF THE FIRST MILLION, HALF A PERCENT AFTER.
YOU WANNA FEEL A DAMP PALM, AL,
SELECT EITHER OF THESE HANDS.
JUST GET TO THE FUNERAL, E.B. GO TO 20 IF YOU HAVE TO.
JUST GET THAT FUCKING CLAIM.
20 IF I HAVE TO.
MY WORD.
WHAT A HANDSOME MAN.
WISH I COULD TELL YOU I RECOGNIZE HIM.
THANK YOU ANYWAY.
- YOUR DAD, I EXPECT.
- YES.
YOU HAVE REASON TO THINK HE'S OUT HERE?
HE WROTE US FROM BISMARCK HE'D BE PROSPECTING THE HILLS.
- "US" BEING?
- MY BROTHER.
HE JUST GOT WORK OVER HERE.
GOOD FOR HIM.
SO IT'S JUST THE TWO OF YOU?
OUR MOTHER PASSED, WHY WE COME FROM BUFFALO.
- AND YOU'RE OUT HERE LOOKING FOR YOUR DAD.
- YES.
- UH, HENRY?
- YES.
OUT HERE LOOKING FOR HER FATHER, EDDIE.
HER AND HER OLDER BROTHER.
GOT A PHOTOGRAPH, I DON'T...
I DON'T RECOGNIZE THE LIKENESS.
NO.
- HENRY ANDERSON?
- YES.
- YEAH, I DON'T RECOGNIZE HIM.
- MM.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WHILE YOUR BROTHER WORKS?
WORK TOO, WHILE WE'RE LOOKING TO SET ASIDE, IF WE HAVE TO MOVE ON.
AH, IF DAD DOESN'T TURN UP HERE.
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU DO?
COOK, CLEAN, SEW, SWEEP.
UH-HUH.
- HOW QUICK DO YOU LEARN?
- GUESS I LEARNPRETTY QUICK.
MAESTRO.
WE ARE STRANGERS AND SOJOURNERS.
MR. GARRET'S BURIAL PLACE
IS A GREAT DISTANCE FROM NEW YORK CITY.
BUT HIS HEART...
INGRID...
MARTA.
- AND ON THE GREAT DAY...
- MAMA.
- HIS FATHER WILL TAKE HIM INTO IT.
- PAPA.
AS HE WILL ALL WHO CONFESS HIS SON SAVIOR
FROM WHEREVER WE MAY BE PUT TO REST.
OUR HYMN IS "A MIGHTY FORTRESS."
* A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR GOD *
* A BULWARK NEVER FAILING... *
- MY SYMPATHIES, MADAM, - * OUR HELPER...
BUT, MY OWN REQUIREMENTS FORCE ME
TO IGNORE WHAT'S SEEMLY.
I MUST DECIDE WHERE TO PLACE MY CAPITAL.
MIGHT RAISING MY OFFER TO SAY, $19,500, UH,
PROMPT YOU TO AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER?
- NO, MR. FARNUM.
- * DOTH SEEK TO WORK US WOE *
* LORD SABBATH, HIS NAME *
- * HIS CRAFT AND POWER...
- I WOULD AS SOON NOT SEE BILL NOW.
I'LL SEE HIM SOME OTHER TIME.
COME ON.
* ON EARTH IS NOT HIS EQUAL... *
I WILL REQUIRE A DECISION WITHIN 24 HOURS-
PLEASE, STOP SPEAKING TO ME, MR. FARNUM.
* DID WE IN OUR OWN STRENGTH CONFIDE *
* OUR STRIVING WOULD BE LOSING *
* WERE NOT THE RIGHT MAN BY OUR SIDE... *
* THE MAN OF GOD'S OWN CHOOSING. *
I HOPE YOU AIN'T GIVED UP ON THAT LITTLE RUNT OF A GIRL, AL.
OH, DO YOU WORRY FOR HER, DAN?
WANDERING THE MUCK OF OUR THOROUGHFARE,
HER TINY SELF ALL BUT SWALLOWED UP IN HORSESHIT?
HEY, KID!
COME HERE.
- YES, SIR?
- STAND WITH US HERE A SECOND.
WHAT ARE- WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WAITING.
Al:
AND OUT THE DOOR HE'LL GO,
AND PROMPT AS A SWISS FUCKING TIMEPIECE
THREE BIG-TITTIED WHORES WILL NOW EMERGE FROM BEHIND THAT SCREEN.
HE LINES 'EM UP AT TWO-FOOT INTERVALS,
SMOCK TOPS DOWN,
AND ALL BUT SPRINTS PAST 'EM,
GIVING THEIR TITTIES A LICK.
AND IF HE MISSES A TITTY,
DOES NOT LET HIMSELF RETRACE HIS STEPS.
- DON'T TELL ME.
- YEAH, AND THEN HE GOES ON HIS WAY HOME,
RELIEVED FOR THE DAY.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
IT'S MILES, HUH?
- MILES, YEAH.
- YEAH.
STRANGE, HUH, MILES?
BUT SOMETHING YOU GOTTA KNOW ABOUT SPECIALISTS.
THEY PAY A PREMIUM
AND THEY NEVER CAUSE FUCKING TROUBLE.
I SOMETIMES IMAGINE IN MY DECLINING YEARS RUNNING A SMALL JOINT
IN MANCHESTER, ENGLAND, CATERING TO SPECIALISTS EXCLUSIVE.
AND TO LET 'EM KNOW THEY'RE AMONGST THEIR OWN, I'LL OPERATE FROM THE CORNER,
HANGING UPSIDE DOWN LIKE A FUCKING BAT, HMM?
- OH, WE'RE NOT SUCH BAD SORTS HERE, HUH, MILES?
- NO, SIR.
SO DO YOU WANNA ASK YOUR SISTER IF SHE'D LIKE TO RECONSIDER, HMM?
- YOU DON'TREALLY MEAN THAT, MR. SWEARENGEN.
- OF COURSE I DON'T MEAN IT.
HOW DARE YOU SUGGEST I'D MEAN A THING LIKE THAT, HUH?
I DID MY PART.
RAISED OUR OFFER TO 20 AND DEMANDED ANSWER WITHIN THE DAY.
BUT WHAT, YOU COCKSUCKER?
COMPLICATIONS HAVE ENSUED:
BULLOCK'S COME BACK.
I EXPECT SHE'LL WANNA TAKE COUNSEL WITH HIM.
TELL THE WHORE I WANNA SEE HER.
AND I TRUST THIS DOESN'T ALTER OUR AGREEMENT.
I TRUST YOU KNOW 2% OF NOTHING'S FUCKING NOTHING.
THAT FELLA FROM MONTANA
I KNEW TO TRUST WON'T BE ABLE TO ASSAY YOUR CLAIM.
- I SEE.
- WE'LL ENGAGE SOMEONE LOCAL, AND I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
AS I'VE DECIDED TO STAY IN CAMP, MR. BULLOCK,
AT LEAST FOR THE NEAR TERM,
I HOPE YOU'LL FEEL ABSOLVED OF THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES
TOWARDS MY INTEREST THAT YOU UNDERTOOK AT MR. HICKOK'S REQUEST.
I PREFER TO SEE 'EM THROUGH.
THEY'RE PROPERLY MINE.
I EVEN FEEL MARGINALLY CAPABLE OF SHOULDERING THEM
AND I CERTAINLY REALIZE THAT YOU AND MR. STAR
HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF YOUR OWN.
ARE YOU FIRING ME, MRS. GARRET?
I'M OFFERING YOU ABSOLUTION.
OTHERWISE I'M STAYING ON.
I'M SO SORRY YOU WERE HURT.
SO, HOW HARD ARE THEY COMING AT YOU TO SELL?
I COULD CONFIDE
THAT IN AN EFFORT TO BLUR MY JUDGMENT,
MR. SWEARENGEN ENGAGED INTERMEDIARIES
TO INDULGE ME WITH OPIUM.
BUT THAT WOULD ENTAIL ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
I'VE HAD A WEAKNESS IN THAT DIRECTION.
UH...
MORE APPROPRIATELY, UH, I COULD ADD
AT THE GRAVEYARD MR. FARNUM RAISED HIS OFFER
$7,500,
PRESUMABLY ALSO ON MR. SWEARENGEN'S INSTRUCTION,
AND SET A 24-HOUR LIMIT TO MY REPLY.
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I'D SAY THAT'S COMING PRETTY HARD.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR MAKING YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, MR. BULLOCK.
I HAD BETTER MANNERS BEFORE I BEGAN TO ABSTAIN.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
ANYWAYS, ARE YOU AT RISK FOR THE SMALLPOX?
I WAS INOCULATED IN NEW YORK CITY.
THE CHILD WHOSE LIFE YOU SAVED PRESUMABLY HAS NOT BEEN,
BUT I ASSUME SHE'S SAFER UNDER MY CARE
THAN TRAVELING IN A COVERED WAGON WITH STRANGERS.
ANYWAYS, I'LL LINE UP THE ASSAYER.
THANK YOU.
YOU ARE CHANGED.
YOU SEEM TO BE TOO.
OUR STOCK'S DEPLETED, BUT WE ARE OFFERING A 100% DISCOUNT
ON ANY ITEM THAT CATCHES YOUR EYE.
I'VE GOT MONEY.
OUR SPECIAL GET- ACQUAINTED-WITH-THOSE-
WE'D-LIKE-TO-GET- ACQUAINTED-WITH SALE.
MR. UTTER.
I BROUGHT THESE PICKAXES FOR YOU TO SELL.
THERE'S TWO SIFTERS ON THAT BLACK CAYUSE OUT THERE.
MIGHTY GRATEFUL, SIR.
YOU GOT THIS PLACE JUST ABOUT BUILT, DON'T YOU?
SAVING THE LAST MASTER-STROKES FOR SETH.
OH, HELLO.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.
HELLO.
HEY, THAT'S THAT LITTLE GIRL, ISN'T IT?
TAKING CARE OF HER FOR MRS. GARRET.
AS MUCH AS SHE FAVORS YOU, SHE COULD BE YOURS.
I LOST THE RECEIPTS FOR MY COSTS.
MAYBE WHILE YOU WAS BUSY SAVING MY PARTNER'S LIFE.
LET ME GET THESE SIFTERS FOR YOU.
SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE THOSE ACCOUNTS ADD UP.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD ME INSIDE
THANKING YOU FOR HELPING MY FRIEND.
I HEARD YOU.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M SORRY YOU LOST YOURS.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
WELCOME BACK, MR. UTTER.
WE'VE HAD A MILD INCREASE IN RATES,
BUT I DO HAVE A ROOM AVAILABLE.
I'LL SEE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT, MR. FARNUM?
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR TRIXIE
THAT'S LOOKING TO THAT ORPHAN CHILD.
- SHE'S TO SEE HER LONGER-TERM EMPLOYER.
- I'LL TELL HER.
YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?
I KNOW SHE WORKS AT THE GEM.
AND EVEN SO, ADMIT HER TO YOUR TRADE AT PUBLIC HOURS.
CONGRATULATIONS, SIR, ON YOUR ADVANCED THINKING.
AL WANTS YOU, TRIXIE.
STICKLER FOR SELF-DELIVERED MESSAGES.
OUR DAD AIN'T HERE.
I KNOW IT, EVEN IF MY BROTHER DON'T.
MAYBE HE NEVER EVEN TRIED TO GET HERE.
OR MAYBE HE DID TRY TO GET HERE AND COULDN'T,
MAYBE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM.
THERE'S SO MANY WAYS IT COULD BE, FLORA,
IT'S NOT MUCH POINT DECIDING WHICH IT WAS.
HE'D NEVER THINK THAT, THOUGH, MY BROTHER.
MUST BE HOW HE NEEDS TO DO.
I AIN'T A VIRGIN-
IF YOU WANNA KNOW THAT.
I HAD A BOYFRIEND IN BUFFALO.
WELL, WAS YOU UPSET TO HAVE TO LEAVE HIM?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS UPSET.
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A STUPID SON OF A BITCH.
AND ROUGH.
HERE.
YOU CAN'T TELL MY BROTHER ABOUT HIM.
HE'D MAKE IT BACK TO BUFFALO AND SHOOT LEWIS IN THE HEAD.
ALL THAT WAY IN DEFENSE OF YOUR VIRTUE?
THAT'S MORE TROUBLE THAN I EVER TOOK WITH IT.
CY.
LAZARUS RISEN.
LOOK AT YOU, YOU SON OF A GUN.
HELLO, CY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, ANDY.
DON'T BE AFRAID TO SHAKE WITH ME, EDDIE.
I AIN'T CONTAGIOUS NO MORE.
HIGHLY BECOMING OUTFIT.
I'M HERE FOR MY BELONGINGS.
LOOK...
THEY'RE GONE, ANDY.
MEASURES TO STOP THE SPREAD.
AH HELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU'RE WELL.
I'LL FRONT YOU WHATEVER YOU NEED.
LET'S GET SOMETHING GOING, HMM?
- ANDY?
- IN THE FLESH, SWEETHEART.
- WHICH AIN'T MUCH TO LOOK AT.
- YOU MADE IT, ANDY.
OH, AND WE AIN'T GETTING NOTHING GOING.
ALL I COME BACK FOR, CY, WAS MY THINGS,
AND YOU TOSSED THEM TOO.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THIS AND GET YOURSELF OUTTA THAT CLOWN OUTFIT?
ONCE YOU'VE COOLED OFF A LITTLE,
THINK HOW YOU'D HAVE DONE DIFFERENT WHEN SOMEBODY SHOWED UP
IN THE SHAPE YOU WAS IN AND MY RESPONSIBILITIES TO MEET.
BETTER THAN TO THROW HIM IN THE WOODS TO FUCKING DIE?
THEN DON'T THINK ABOUT NOTHING, ANDY.
USE THE MONEY FOR A WHORE
AND A TOOT AND GO JOIN THE FUCKING CIRCUS.
DID YOU TURN HER OUT?
HER BROTHER'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM.
FUCK HER BROTHER.
WE'LL HANDLE THE BROTHER
IF WE HAVE TO KILL THE COCKSUCKER.
THAT'S AN INTERESTING PIECE OF STRANGE.
( knocking )
AIN'T YOU A PICTURE?
- WHAT IS IT?
- HMM?
OH, AM I DETAINING YOU IN SOME WAY?
AM I FUCKING IMPOSING?
MRS. GARRET'S TO SIT DOWN WITH BULLOCK.
I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT ME OVER THERE.
OH YEAH, SO YOU CAN BRING ME A FULL AND FAIR REPORT, HUH?
BUT WILL THE WIDOW HAVE HER WITS ABOUT HER, TRIXIE, HUH?
OR WILL THEY BE PASSING THE OPIUM PIPE
LIKE HEATHENS BETWEEN 'EM, HER AND FUCKING BULLOCK, HMM?
- WHAT'RE YOU PISSED OFF FOR?
- I AIN'T PISSED OFF.
I'M IN FUCKING WONDERMENT.
I'M WAITING TO BE KEPT HAPPY BY THE NEXT FUCKING FAIRY TALE.
DO YOU WANT ME BACK AT THE HOTEL
OR DO YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING TO ME?
NOW WHY WOULD I WANT YOU TO GO BACK THERE, HUH?
OR RELY ON ANYTHING YOU SAID TRANSPIRED
AFTER YOU LIED ABOUT HER TAKING DOPE, HUH?
HER BEING HIGH...
WASN'T GONNA HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHETHER OR NOT SHE SOLD YOU THAT CLAIM,
AND SHE WANTED TO GET OFF THE DOPE.
AND THAT LITTLE ONE NEEDS SOMEONE TO CARE FOR HER...
AND MAYBE GET HER THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.
AND I KNEW IT WASN'T GONNA BE ME.
SO YOU WANT ME BACK OVER THERE
AND TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY FUCKING DECIDE?
OR DO YOU WANNA RIP MY FUCKING GUTS OUT?
YOU GET BACK THERE QUICK.
DON'T KID YOURSELF, TRIXIE.
DON'T GET A MISTAKEN IDEA.
MR. UTTER.
THIS IS WHERE BILL GOT KILLED, HUH?
UH...
I'LL BE SORRY ABOUT THAT FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE.
CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT?
YEAH.
IT
- IT WAS ABOUT SUN-UP
OVER AT THAT BELLA UNION JOINT,
MR. HICKOK PLUM GUTTED McCALL AT DRAW.
AND NOW HERE MR. HICKOK WAS AT POKER AGAIN.
SAY A COUPLE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT
AND IN COME THAT COWARD McCALL.
WALKED UP ON HIM AND SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD.
BILL NEVER KNOW WHEN HE COME IN.
UH, THOSE OF US THAT DID,
WE DIDN'T HAVE NO INKLING OF WHAT HE INTENDED.
HE JUST MURDERED HIM, RIGHT WHERE HE SAT.
Man:
IF I MAY, SIR...
THIS IS HERE WHERE
WILD BILL WAS SITTING WHEN McCALL ENTERED FROM THE FRONT,
APPROACHED THE TABLE, CAUSING NO APPREHENSION
'CAUSE HE HAD OFTEN FREQUENTED THE GAME.
OF A SUDDEN, McCALL PRODUCED A REVOLVER
AND SHOUTING "TAKE THAT, DAMN YOU!" HE FIRED.
MUZZLE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THREE INCHES FROM WILD BILL'S HEAD.
NOW I'M TOLD THAT HICKOK FELL DEAD IMMEDIATELY,
BUT I WON'T TESTIFY TO IT,
BECAUSE THE BULLET, AFTER IT PASSED THROUGH WILD BILL'S BRAIN,
STRUCK ME IN MY RIGHT WRIST,
AND I LOST SEVERAL SECONDS TO PAIN BEFORE REGAINING MY SENSES.
SIR, YOU HAVE MY WORD AS EYEWITNESS TO THE REST,
AND I SUPPOSE THIS WOUND AS ADDED PROOF FOR THE DOCTORS
THEY FEARED CRIPPLED ME IN THE HAND I USE TO WRITE.
I WILL TAKE THE MURDERER'S BULLET TO MY GRAVE.
THANKS.
ACES OVER EIGHTS,
AS I JUST NOW RECALL.
THAT IS THE HAND THAT WILD BILL HAD.
SURE, CAPTAIN.
SURE.
YOU LIKE HOW THAT FALLS?
SURE.
- DO YOU LIKE IT, FLORA?
- WHY NOT?
I'D PREFER YOU HAPPY, HONEY, BUT IF YOU CAN'T BE,
YOU NEED TO PRETEND AT IT BETTER THAN YOU'RE DOING
OR YOU'RE GONNA BE HUNGRY AND COLD
AND GETTING DONE TO YOU FOR NOTHING OUTSIDE
WHAT YOU'D HAVE MADE MONEY TO LIVE ON AND SAVE UP BESIDES
IF YOU ACTED THE PART IN HERE.
I THOUGHT I ONLY HAD TO ACT IT WITH THEM THAT WANNA STICK IT IN ME.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO THAT MIGHT BE, FLORA.
THERE YOU GO.
I PREFER YOU HAPPY.
OR AT LEAST PRETENDING BETTER?
I THINK HE'S DEAD, DOC.
COULD YOU TELL THE LITTER BEARERS NOT TO MAKE SO MUCH OF GETTING THIS ONE OUTTA HERE?
- HAS YOUNG JOEY GONE TO DUST?
- YEAH.
AS FLESH MUST,
TO BE RESTORED BY THE SAVIOR'S RETURN.
OH, MR. BULLOCK IS BACK AMONG US,
AND ALSO, ALSO MR. UTTER.
DOES CHARLIE KNOW ABOUT BILL?
THEY WERE TOGETHER, MR. BULLOCK AND HE.
THEY'D CAPTURED JACK McCALL.
I HOPE THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING OF WHAT THEY FUCKING DID TO HIM.
- GAVE HIM OVER TO THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES.
- GAVE HIM OVER?
- RENDERED UNTO CAESAR.
- JESUS CHRIST.
MR.
- MR. BULLOCK WAS STRUCK BY AN INDIAN'S AXE.
MARKED LIKE THE FIRST-BORN OF ADAM AND EVE.
- ARE YOU DRUNK?
- NO.
( groaning )
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?
- HE'S ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, REVEREND.
ALL RIGHT, REVEREND.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, REVEREND.
ALL RIGHT.
HE MARKS US SINFUL
AND FORGIVEN BY CONFESSION.
ALL RIGHT.
HE HAS TOLD US AND SHOWN US.
HE HAS TOLD ME.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU LISTEN TO ME NOW, REVEREND.
YOU ARE GODDAMN EXHAUSTED,
AND YOU GIVE YOURSELF NO RESPITE.
THESE SEIZURES MAY OWE SOMETHING TO THAT,
BUT IT ALSO WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME
IF YOU HAD A LESION IN YOUR GODDAMN HEAD,
AND THAT'S WHAT'S GIVING YOU THE SEIZURES
AND GENERATING YOUR CHATS WITH THE GODDAMN DIVINITY.
NO GODDAMN OFFENSE INTENDED.
- NONE TAKEN, SIR.
- NOW GET OUTTA HERE,
- AND GET YOURSELF SOME REST!
- Jane:
GO ON, REVEREND.
DOC'S TIRED TOO,
THE ONLY REASON HE'S TALKING SO FUCKING HARSH.
COULD NOT THE LESION BE
THE INSTRUMENT OF GOD'S INSTRUCTIVE INTENTION, DOCTOR,
IF I AM SO AFFLICTED?
WELL, OF COURSE IT COULD,
HIS WAYS NOT BEING OURS AND SO FORTH.
BUT COULD HE NOT, REVEREND, JUST WANT YOU
GETTING OUT OF HERE AND GETTING YOURSELF SOME GODDAMN REST?
- Flora:
YOU HAVE TO GO NOW.
- WE DON'T HAVE TODO NOTHING,
I'D PAY THE SAME PRICE JUST TO SIT WITH YOU.
MY BROTHER WORKS IN THIS PLACE UP HERE, AND HE KEEPS A HARD WATCH.
IF YOU WANNA STICK IT IN ME TOMORROW,
YOU BETTER LET ME GO IN BY MYSELF.
- WHAT TIME ARE YOU GONNA START?
- 11:00, I GUESS.
I'LL BE RECEIVING AROUND NOON.
ALL RIGHT, FLORA.
HERE'S A DOLLAR ANYWAY.
YOU'RE SWELL.
EVENING.
EVENING, MISS.
- YOU'RE EARLY.
- YES.
- I GUESS NO LUCK FINDING YOUR DAD.
- NO, NO LUCK.
I KNEW YOU WOULD'VE HAD A CHEERIER LOOK ON YOUR FACE IF YOU HAD.
LET ME GET YOU A PLACE TO SIT AWAY FROM THESE ROUGH SONS OF BITCHES.
HEY!
DO YOUR DRINKING AT THE BAR OR GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
YOU HAVE A SEAT HERE.
I'LL GET YOU A BEVERAGE.
DO YOU WANT A SOFT CIDER OR A SARSAPARILLA?
- CIDER IF IT'S NOT A TROUBLE.
- SOFT CIDER.
DID SHE FIND HER DAD?
HER CHANCES OF FINDING HER DAD ARE GREATER THAN YOURS
OF WALKING OUT OF THIS DOOR UPRIGHT,
UNLESS YOU SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH.
YOU GOT IT?
SWEARENGEN'S HAD HIS HAND ON THE TILLER
FAR AS GETTING DEALING WITH THIS EPIDEMIC.
- IS THAT SO?
- YEAH, THE DEAD DON'T DRINK OR CHASE WOMEN
MUST BE HIS THINKING ON THAT SUBJECT.
THAT INDIAN FOUGHT LIKE HELL.
I'D GUESS YOU DID TOO.
CHARLIE FIGURED OUT HOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN.
THE INDIAN HAD TO KILL ME FOR COMING ON THE BURIAL PLACE,
AND MAYBE IT HAD BEEN ME, TOO, THAT KILLED HIS FRIEND,
CUT HIS FRIEND'S HEAD OFF SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE EYES TO SEE THE SUNSET
ALL THOSE YEARS HE'D BE LYING THERE DEAD.
SO HE HAD TO KILL ME FOR THAT TOO.
AND HE COULDN'T BEFORE HE'D LAID HANDS ON ME
OR THE KILLING WOULDN'T BE HONORABLE.
WE FOUGHT LIKE FUCKING HELL, I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH,
AND I NEVER ONCE HAD THE UPPER-HAND.
IT JUST HAPPENED OUT THE WAY IT HAPPENED OUT.
HE WAS JUST TRYING TO LIVE, SAME AS ME,
AND DO HONOR TO HIS FRIEND, AND MAKE SOME FUCKING SENSE OUT OF THINGS.
AND WE WIND UP THAT WAY, AND I WIND UP
AFTER BEATING HIM TILL I COULDN'T RECOGNIZE HIS FACE.
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!
THAT INDIAN SAVED JACK McCALL'S LIFE,
- I'LL TELL YOU THAT FUCKING MUCH.
- NOT FOR LONG.
BRIAN MACDONALD'S NOT COMING.
I WANT HIS RECOMMENDATION
WHO SHOULD ASSAY THAT WIDOW'S CLAIM.
- WHOSE?
- SWEARENGEN'S.
SHIT, SETH.
GET HIS OPINION, TOO, WHO SHOULD GUARD THAT HENHOUSE WE'RE GONNA BUILD.
SO...
ARE YOU OKAY?
- YES, AND YOU?
- YES.
THEY'RE NICE HERE.
AND MR. SWEARENGEN, HE'S FUNNY AS ALL GET-OUT.
SO WHAT PLACE WOULD MAKE A BETTER SCORE?
WHERE I'M WORKING.
BUT WHY NOT TAKE 'EM BOTH?
- COULD WE HAVE A PRIVATE TALK?
- SURE WE CAN.
- SHOULD I BE ARMED?
- WHERE DO YOU WANNA TALK?
COME HERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
I THINK THAT SON OF A BITCH BETTER STOP LOOKING EVIL AT THAT LITTLE GIRL.
- SO WAS IT McCALL WHO IMPROVED YOUR APPEARANCE?
- NO.
WHOEVER GOT THE JOB DONE, I HOPE YOU GAVE AS GOOD AS YOU GOT.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, WITH ME BEING SUPERSTITIOUS
AND ALL HELL BREAKING LOOSE WHEN YOU LEFT.
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT MRS. GARRET.
THEY PLANTED HER HUSBAND THIS MORNING?
I WROTE A MAN ABOUT COMING TO ASSAY HER CLAIM,
- BUT HE CAN'T MAKE IT.
- PLENTY OF LOCAL ALTERNATIVES.
I WANT YOU TO NOMINATE SOMEONE.
DO YOU?
SO IF ANY WAY HIS WORK WAS MISTAKEN,
I'D BE COMING AFTER YOU.
- YOU WOULD?
- YEAH.
SINCE I GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VENTURE,
WHAT IF I DECLINE TO MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION?
THEN YOU BETTER HOPE WHOEVER I FIND DOES HIS JOB RIGHT,
'CAUSE I'M STILL HOLDING YOU ACCOUNTABLE.
I AIN'T INVOLVED.
E.B. FARNUM OFFERED ON HER CLAIM.
FARNUM'S YOUR WATER-BOY AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO TO HER.
SO HERE YOU COME IN ALL NOBILITY...
THREATENING ME WITH A DIRE RESULT
IF THE PROPERTY OF THAT WIDOW'S HUSBAND
THOUGHT WORTHLESS FROM WHEN IT SOLD,
TURNS OUT NOT TO BE PINCHED OUT.
YOU AND I KNOW HOW IT IS, MR. SWEARENGEN.
- HOW WHAT IS?
- SHE GETS A SQUARE SHAKE,
OR I COME FOR YOU.
WHAT IF I COME FOR YOU?
ARE YOU READY FOR THAT?
I GUESS I'D BETTER BE.
THEN CLOSE YOUR FUCKING STORE, 'CAUSE BEING READY FOR ME
WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR WAKING HOURS
AND YOU BETTER HAVE SOMEONE TO HAND THE TASK OFF TO WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES.
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.
Man:
AL!
AL!
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!
WALK RIGHT PAST ME, YOUR HOLINESS,
SO I CAN SHUT MY FUCKING OFFICE.
AL!
Dan:
GO ON!
STARE AT HER NOW!
HUH?
YOU LIKE FUCKING LITTLE GIRLS?
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LITTLE GIRL
'CAUSE SHE'S THE LAST THING YOU'RE EVER GONNA SEE.
- STARE AT HER NOW, COCKSUCKER.
- Al:
LET HIM DOWN!
LET HIM FUCKING DOWN!
( gagging )
OR SHOULD I HAVE HAD HIM HOLD HIM UP?
YOU HEAD WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE WIDOW.
OH YES, YOUR HOLINESS.
YOU HEARD ME TOO.
SO I TAKE IT THIS WAS A FAIR FUCKING FIGHT, YEAH?
Men:
YEAH!
THAT'S RIGHT!
- TWO FREE DRINKS FOR EVERYBODY.
- ( men cheering )
AND DRINKS ALL NIGHT FOR THEM THAT HELP WITH THE DISPOSAL.
Man #2:
THAT'S ME!
I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO SEE THAT.
SHUT THE FUCK UP, DAN, AND GET HER THE FUCK AWAY FROM HERE
- NOW!
COME ON.
I'M SORRY, MR. SWEARENGEN.
I WARNED HIM NOT TO LOOK AT HER.
I WARNED HIM.
FUCKING PUSSY.
Jane:
THAT JOEY PASSED THIS AFTERNOON.
BEEN SUFFERING AWFUL.
BUT THAT FROG-LOOKING FELLOW LEFT THE TENT
THAT I FOUND UP IN THE WOODS,
LEFT THE TENT FUCKING CURE PRONOUNCED BY THE DOC HIMSELF.
AND IN THE DUMBEST LOOKING OUTFIT A GROWN MAN EVER WORE.
WHO'S THERE, GOD DAMN IT?
!
WHO THE HELL'S IT LOOK LIKE?
HOW THE FUCK DO I KNOW WHO IT FUCKING LOOKS LIKE?
IT'S DARK!
JESUS CHRIST, COME UPON A PERSON UNAWARES IN A FUCKING GRAVEYARD!
I HEARD YOU WAS BACK IN THE CAMP.
I HEARD YOU AND THAT BULLOCK GOT THE COCKSUCKER DID FOR BILL.
WAS BILL DEAD BY THE TIME YOU SAW HIM?
YEAH, HE WAS ALREADY DEAD.
WHY DID HE LET THAT SON OF A BITCH GET TO HIM?
I DON'T KNOW, CHARLIE.
ANYWAYS, PEOPLE DON'T SCARE ME PAST SPEAKING,
I COME UP HERE NIGHTS TELL HIM THE FUCKING NEWS.
GO AHEAD.
CHARLIE AVENGED YOUR FUCKING MURDER.
AND THAT BULLOCK FELLA WAS WITH ME THAT YOU SEEMED TO LIKE.
ALTHOUGH IT OCCURRED TO ME TO WONDER WHY THEY DIDN'T DO FOR THE COCKSUCKER
- RIGHT ON THE FUCKING SPOT.
- IS THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO GET INTO IN FRONT OF HIM?
YOU GOT THE BIGGEST MOUTH IN THE TERRITORY.
YOU TALK TO HIM.
TELL HIM WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I GOT THAT MAIL ROUTE IN CHEYENNE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.
I WAS BRINGING BACK SUPPLIES TO THEM HARDWARE BOYS
AND I RUN INTO THAT BULLOCK FELLA.
HE WAS OUT THERE LOOKING FOR THAT McCALL
THAT
- THAT KILLED YOU.
AND HE RUN INTO SOME HEATHEN BOY
AND HE HAD ONE HELL OF A FIGHT.
BOY, AND HE JUST- HE GOT-
HE GOT F-
FUCK.
CAN I-
CAN I TELL HIM SOME MORE TOMORROW?
SURE, WHAT THE FUCK YOU ASKING ME FOR?
I DON'T MAKE THE RULES.
WANNA GO BACK TO THE CAMP?
PLEASE.
AND WHAT MUST MR. BULLOCK HAVE BEEN THINKING
AS I INFLICTED MY PERSONAL CONFIDENCES UPON HIM?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- NOR DO I.
AT LEAST HE KEPT A DECENT PRIVACY.
I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE GEM.
HE'S WAITING FOR ME NOW TO TELL HIM
YOURS AND MR. BULLOCK'S THINKING ABOUT SELLING THE CLAIM,
AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO LIE ANYMORE.
NEXT I TELL WILL BE MY LAST.
SO I BETTER JUST GET BACK THERE.
MR. SWEARENGEN DISCOVERED OUR DECEPTION?
- YEAH.
- HOW?
- LOOKING AT YOU WALK OUT OF THE FUCKING HOTEL.
- HE DID NOT.
I WAS CAREFUL TO SEE HE WASN'T WATCHING IN THE WINDOW.
IT DON'T MATTER, MRS. GARRET.
THE POINT IS, I GOTTA GO BACK.
AND YOU NEED SOMEONE TO LOOK TO THIS CHILD,
AND WITH CHOICES BIGGER ELSEWHERE
AND NOTHING I CAN TELL TO HOLD YOU HERE,
MAYBE YOU BETTER THINK ABOUT SELLING AND GETTING OUT.
WOULD YOU WANNA TAKE THE GIRL AND GO?
WHERE?
- I HAVE NO PEOPLE ANYWHERE.
- YOU COULD GOTO NEW YORK.
I
- I COULD HAVE MY RELATIVES THERE SEE YOU ESTABLISHED.
WHAT THE FUCK?
WHAT WOULD KEEP YOU HERE?
YOU WANNA FUCK THIS MAN?
FUCK HIM, THEN THINK ABOUT THE CHILD-
DON'T USE THAT LANGUAGE WITH ME, TRIXIE, OR THAT TONE-
DON'T YOU WANNA SAY TO REMEMBER MY PLACE?
I DO, YOU RICH CUNT.
AND I'M GOING BACK TO IT.
SHE'S ABOUT TO SAY HER NAME, YOU KNOW.
SHE NAMED HER SISTERS AND HER FOLKS.
THINK OF SELLING.
IF YOU TOOK HER AWAY, YOU COULD HEAR HER SAY IT.
* OLD FRIEND
* ALL THE STORIES TO TELL *
* OLD FRIEND
* COULD YOU BID ME FAREWELL?
*
* OOH, OLD FRIEND
* IT MIGHT BE EASY FOR ANOTHER MAN TO SEE *
* OLD FOOL
* ALL THE PAIN AND THE SCARS *
* OLD FOOL
* COULD YOU LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS?
*
* OLD FOOL
* IT MIGHT BE EASY FOR ANOTHER MAN TO SEE *
* BUT I THINK YOU STILL LOOK A LOT LIKE ME. *
( theme music playing )
Al YOU MIGHT, DAN,
WANT TO LEARN HOW TO INDICATE INTEREST IN A GIRL
OTHER THAN MURDERING ANOTHER PERSON.
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DISRUPTION
AND THE FREE DRINKS YOU HAD TO GIVE OUT RESTORING ORDER.
JESUS CHRIST, IT'S FALSE DAWN, AL.
FALSE DAWN ALREADY.
IF WE'RE GONNA ACT, WE SHOULD DO IT IN DARKNESS.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING WHORE?
WHEREVER TRIXIE IS, WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO.
BULLOCK'S FOUR SQUARE BEHIND THE NEW YORK WOMAN.
THE QUESTION'S DO WE ACT?
AND TO ME, THE COURSE IS CLEAR.
WELL, WHAT'S THE COURSE?
MURDER THEM WHERE THEY SLEEP!
THE NEW YORK WOMAN AND BULLOCK BOTH.
DAN, LOAN E.B. YOUR KNIFE.
NAH, I WON'T BRANDISH THE KNIFE,
BUT I'LL WIELD A PASSKEY AT THE WIDOW'S DOOR.
AS FOR BULLOCK, HE SLEEPS ON HIS STORE'S SECOND FLOOR,
AND I'LL STEADY A LADDER, DAN, AT THAT WALL,
WHILE YOU CLIMB UP AND BUSHWHACK HIM.
THEN, WITH THEM DEAD AND DISPOSED OF,
WE FORGE A PREDATED BILL OF SALE, TAKE POSSESSION OF THE CLAIM
WITH THE ALLOCATED PERCENTAGES OF OWNERSHIP
PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO IN OUR INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS,
AND DON'T SPEND A FUCKING DOLLAR IN THE PROCESS.
BOLD?
I SUPPOSE.
BUT WHEN BOLDNESS IS CALLED FOR,
BOLD MEN DO NOT SHRINK.
- THAT'S WHAT THE B IN E.B. FARNUM STANDS FOR.
- BOLD.
( slams desk ) YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT.
SAY IT, AL.
SAY THE FUCKING WORDS MY BONES ALREADY KNOW.
YOU'RE GONNA BACK OFF ON THAT FUCKING CLAIM.
( gunshots )
( cheering )
WE BRUNG IT, SIR.
VACCINE FOR THE SMALLPOX, SECURED IN CHEYENNE.
WELL DONE, FELLAS, AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THE ENTIRE FUCKING SETTLEMENT.
E.B., GET DOWNSTAIRS AND GIVE THESE HEROES WHAT THEY'RE OWED.
- YES, SIR. $50 A MAN.
- IF YOU DON'T SPEND IT IN MY JOINT,
I'LL TURN THE MOURNING OVER TO WEEPING.
YOU WON'T SHED NARY A TEAR ON OUR ACCOUNT, MR. SWEARENGEN.
VACCINE TO DOC COCHRAN IN THE PEST TENT.
WE'LL BE TOASTING THE TREATY, TOO, WITH THE FUCKING HEATHENS.
- EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
- Man:
THEY'VE ALL BEEN
CALLED BACK TO THE AGENCY.
WE HEARD THAT IN CHEYENNE.
- ARE THEY GOING'S THE FUCKING QUESTION.
- FUCK YEAH, THEY ARE.
Man #2:
THAT'S THE WORD IN CHEYENNE.
RED CLOUD AND SPOTTED TAIL ARE LEADING THEIR PEOPLE IN.
DAN, $10 IN BONUS CREDITS ACROSS THE BOARD FOR THESE HEROES.
10 IN PUSSY, 10 IN FARO, 10 IN BOOZE.
- ( men cheer )
- GOD BLESS YOU, MR. SWEARENGEN!
WELL, NOT LIKELY,
BUT MY SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS JUST IMPROVED.
SAY THE WORDS, SO I CAN LET THE DREAM DIE.
E.B., DID YOU NOT HEAR THE FUCKING NEWS?
DID YOU NOT LISTEN TO THE FUCKING NEWS?
THAT PLAGUE'S END'S IN PROSPECT.
AND SO'S PEACE WITH THE FUCKING DIRT WORSHIPPERS.
COME HERE, COME HERE.
SIT DOWN.
THE DAM...
HAS BROKEN, YOUNG MAN,
AND ONLY OURSELVES CAN FUCK UP,
FOR WE ARE ABOUT TO BE SWIMMING IN MONEY.
AND HOW COULD WE FUCK UP?
BY ENGAGING IN OPEN FUCKING BLOODLETTING.
AND RIGHT HERE AT HAND IN OUR VERY HOUR OF NEED
IS THE PRIGGISH FUCKING DOUCHE BAG, BULLOCK,
WHO ONLY WANTS TO SELL POTS AND PANS,
FAN HIS PRETTY FACE AND HOLD HIS NOSE
FROM THE STENCH OF OUR SORDID CARRYINGS ON OVER HERE,
ALL THE TIME THINKING HE CAN PROTECT THE MEEK AND INNOCENT.
THE PERFECT FUCKING FRONT MAN.
AND YOU WANT TO KILL HIM?
MUCH AS WE MIGHT WANT THE WIDOW'S CLAIM,
IT'S A LUXURY NOW TO FOREGO.
E.B., FIND YOURSELF SOMEWHERE TO LIE DOWN
TILL THE FEELING PASSES, HUH?
FIRST, I'LL GO GIVE THE HOOPLE HEADS THEIR MONEY.
THANK YOU.
YOU GO FIND THAT FUCKING WHORE.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, HUH?
( in hoarse voice ) I LOST MY VOICE.
( knocks )
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- I SEEN SOMETHING BAD.
COME IN.
HERE, SIT DOWN.
I SEEN SOMETHING AT THE PLACE MY BROTHER WORKS.
A MAN WAS STABBED AND KILLED RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
ONE MAN SAID HE DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY THE OTHER MAN
WAS LOOKING AT ME, AND HE STABBED AND KILLED HIM.
DRINK THIS.
WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER NOW?
WE GOT A ROOM.
I'LL GO IN A MINUTE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, FLORA.
I'VE JUST COME TO SAY I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS.
IT'S HORRIBLE.
IT'S ONE THING LEADS TO ANOTHER
AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
MOSTLY YOU CAN STEER IT, SWEETHEART,
AND WHEN IT'S GONNA GET TO WHERE YOU CAN'T,
YOU GET JUST A LITTLE NOTICE, JUST A COUPLE OF SECONDS
BEFORE THE ONE THING TURNS INTO THE OTHER.
IT'S LIKE A FUNNY SMELL COMES INTO THE AIR,
THEN YOU KNOW THERE'S NO MORE STEERING
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY.
I SMELLED IT IN THE SALOON.
AND DID YOU GET OUT OF THE WAY IN TIME?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
MILES DOESN'T KNOW NOTHING.
HE DIDN'T SMELL NOTHING AND HE...
DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WHAT TO DO.
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW.
CAN I STAY?
CAN I SLEEP HERE WITH YOU JUST THIS LAST LITTLE WHILE BEFORE WE HAVE TO GET UP?
YEAH, YOU CAN SLEEP HERE WITH ME.
CAN YOU HELP?
- NAME?
- BOLAND.
MAKE YOUR MARK.
SAINT ANDY CRAMED.
ALL THAT'S MISSING ARE THE SCOURGES AND FLAYS.
- MAYBE THEY'RE UNDER HIS SHIRT.
- ( laughs )
KIND OF YOU TO LET US WORK OUT OF THE HORSESHIT AND FLIES.
SURE.
( groans )
JESUS CHRIST!
( rasping ) HAVE YOU SEEN TRIXIE, DOC?
WHAT?
TRIXIE.
NO, TEA AND HONEY.
- FOR THIS?
- YOU ARE A STUPID SON OF A BITCH.
YEAH, THE TRAFFIC'S A BOON, SETH.
WE'RE UP $27 ALREADY FROM YESTERDAY'S ENTIRE PROCEEDS.
GOOD.
PITIFUL SPECIMEN YOU ARE.
IT WASN'T A PINPRICK.
I AIN'T ATE.
REALLY?
STRANGE YOU NEVER KEELED OVER
WHEN WE WAS HUNGRY ON THE FUCKING TRAIL.
YOUR BOSS SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SENDING ME AN ASSAYER THIS MORNING?
NO, SIR, HE DIDN'T.
I WILL REMIND HIM
ONCE I FINISH HIS ERRANDS.
I ONLY GOT ONE PLACE LEFT TO LOOK:
BELLA UNION-- THAT'S OUR COMPETITION.
WELL, I'LL TELL HIM WHAT YOU SAID.
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING, MR. BULLOCK.
COME TO HAVE THE CHILD INOCULATED?
YES, AND TO TELL YOU,
FOR REASONS WE NEEDN'T EXPLORE, THAT MY PLANS HAVE CHANGED.
AS SOON AS I CAN ARRANGE TRANSPORTATION
I'LL RETURN WITH THE CHILD TO NEW YORK CITY.
WHY NEEDN'T WE EXPLORE YOUR REASONS?
BECAUSE, MR. BULLOCK, I'VE ALREADY
QUITE SUFFICIENTLY IMPOSED UPON YOU
MY PRIVATE REASONS AND FACTS.
AS REGARDS TO THE CLAIM MY HUSBAND PURCHASED BEFORE HIS MURDER,
I'M INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE LAST BID
FROM MR. SWEARENGEN'S HAND-PUPPET
AND I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL IF YOU WOULD TELL MR. FARNUM SO,
AS SPEAKING TO HIM DIRECTLY MAKES ME ILL.
I'M GONNA ASSAY YOUR CLAIM, MRS. GARRET.
I PROMISED MR. HICKOK, AND I PROMISED YOU.
I RELEASED YOU FROM YOUR PROMISE TO ME YESTERDAY.
AND TODAY I INSTRUCT YOU NOT TO KEEP IT.
YOU DO TEND TO CHANGE YOUR MIND,
AND THE FIRST PROMISE, YOU WEREN'T A PARTY TO.
WHY DON'T YOU GET THE CHILD INOCULATED?
I'LL GO ABOUT MY BUSINESS,
AND WE'LL REVISIT THE WHOLE MESS SUBSEQUENTLY.
DON'T FUCKING LEAD ELLSWORTH RIGHT TO IT
SO HE CAN HOOT AND HOLLER AND HAIL FUCKING BULLOCK.
YOU WALK AROUND.
YOU'RE DISCOURAGED.
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH IT TO MAKE THE STEEP ASCENT.
I START FROM BELOW?
YOU START AT THE FUCKING CREEK.
WHAT, DO YOU WANT TO START AT THE CLIFF?
THE THREE OF YOU LEAP THE FUCK OFF HOLDING HANDS?
TOP O' THE MORNIN'.
I'M TO LEAD YOU TO THE WIDOW GARRET'S CLAIM.
- YOU'RE THE ASSAYER?
- NOPE.
- I'M TO TAKE YOU TO HIM.
- HE'S ONE CLAIM OVER.
NICE FUCKING GUY
AND A DEAD EYE FOR THE FUCKING COLOR.
- ELLSWORTH.
- ELLSWORTH...
IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
WELL, COME ON.
I WAS INOCULATED SOME TIME AGO,
BUT I THOUGHT SHE SHOULD BE TREATED BEFORE OUR TRIP.
I AM DELIGHTED YOU'RE TAKING HER WITH YOU.
IT WAS TRIXIE WHO MADE ME REALIZE
THAT MY REASONS FOR STAYING WEREN'T SOUND.
GLAD SHE SUCCEEDED WHERE I FAILED.
I INTEND TO WRITE HER A NOTE OF PROFOUND THANKS.
I HOPE THAT YOU'LL DELIVER IT TO HER
AT MR. SWEARENGEN'S SALOON.
IS THAT WHERE SHE WENT WHEN SHE LEFT YOU?
YES, I CERTAINLY ASSUME SO.
SORRY, I'M SORRY, HONEY.
IT'S ALL OVER.
WHEN WILL YOU BE LEAVIN'?
AS QUICKLY AS IS PRACTICAL.
STAR'LL SEE TO YOUR TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS.
SOON AS HE GETS HIS WITS BACK, I'LL SEND HIM TO YOU.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
WHAT DID SHE SAY ABOUT TRIXIE?
NOTHIN'.
HOW'D YOU DO WITH THAT BLOODSTAIN?
I SCRUBBED IT REAL HARD.
DID I ASK YOU HOW HARD YOU FUCKING SCRUBBED?
- NO.
- NO.
I ASKED IF YOU GOT IT OUT.
GET ME THE FUCKIN' SCRUB BRUSH.
EVERY FUCKING THING I GOTTA DO MYSELF, HUH?
- WHERE IS SHE?
!
- TRIXIE?
NO, QUEEN FUCKING VICTORIA.
LAST I SAW HER WAS YESTERDAY WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE YOU.
JUST GET ME THE FUCKING SCRUB BRUSH.
GIVES HER WORD SHE'LL RETURN.
WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE, HUH?
WHAT'D SHE SAY TO YOU WHEN YOU SAW HER?
SHE SAID HER PUSSY HURT WHERE YOU GRABBED IT.
THAT HAS A RING OF FUCKING TRUTH.
SHE SAID YOU NEARLY KILLED HER.
SHE SAID TO ME SHE'D BE RIGHT BACK.
A FOOL'S FUCKING ERRAND, ANYWAY.
I FOUND OUT WHAT I NEEDED TO KNOW
WHEN I LOOKED IN THAT COCKSUCKER BULLOCK'S EYES
WHILE DORITY WAS SPILLING BLOOD
THAT YOU HAVE FAILED TO ADEQUATELY CLEAN UP.
YOU WANT ME TO DO SOME MORE?
NO, SHUT THE FUCK UP.
NOW, WHAT'S SHE DOIN'?
SHE MAKING A POINT?
NO GRABBING AT THE CUNT?
- IS THAT WHAT SHE SAID TO YOU?
- NO.
I MEAN, Y-YOU-- SHE TOLD YOU, RIGHT, THAT I GRABBED HER?
DID SHE HAVE AN ATTITUDE ABOUT IT?
SHE DIDN'T HAVE AN ATTITUDE.
SHE JUST SAID HER PUSSY HURT.
AGH.
POINT'S MADE WITH THE SNATCH GRABS, OKAY.
50 OTHER FUCKING THINGS I SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO,
ROSIEST PROSPECTS OF MY CAREER,
AND HERE I AM ON MY FUCKING HANDS AND KNEES
DISCUSSING SNIPPETS OF INFORMATION WITH A GIMP.
THERE!
NOW THAT'S HOW YOU SCRUB A FUCKING BLOODSTAIN!
I COULDN'T FIND TRIXIE.
YOU SEE HER,
YOU SEND HER THE FUCK BACK TO ME,
'CAUSE IF I SEE HER OUTSIDE,
SHE'LL WISH I HAD KILLED HER BEFORE.
THAT SHOT DIDN'T HURT TOO BAD, AL,
BUT IT FUCKING ITCHES.
YEAH?
GOOD.
YOU HAD YOUR SHOT YET, KID?
NOT YET.
THE LINE WAS TOO LONG,
AND I DID NOT WANT TO BE LATE FOR WORK.
OPEN FOR BUSINESS AND TALK LIKE HIM
- UNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTED.
- ( rasps ) YES, SIR.
AW, JESUS.
TRIXIE?
GOD DAMN IT, TRIXIE, WAKE UP.
- WAKE UP, TRIXIE.
- ( knock on door )
- TRIXIE, WAKE UP--
- A.W.:
DOC!
DOC!
- WHAT?
!
- DOC!
- STAY THE FUCK OVER THERE!
- IT'S A.W., DOC.
STAY THE FUCK OVER THERE, ANYWAY.
AW, I DON'T TAKE YOUR BAD TEMPER PERSONALLY, DOC.
THE HOURS YOU'RE WORKING WOULD TRY A SAINT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
( panting ) I'M IN PAIN, DOC, IN THE SMALL OF MY BACK,
WHICH I'M AWARE IS A PRECURSOR SYMPTOM.
- WHEN DID THE PAIN START?
- AM I WARM?
ANSWER THE QUESTION.
WELL, IT'S BECOME MORE CONCENTRATED AND SEVERE.
- WHY DID YOU STRIKE ME?
- TO SECURE YOUR ATTENTION.
WHEN DID THE PAIN START?
THE ORIGINAL PAIN I'VE LIVED WITH FOR QUITE SOME TIME,
BUT IN THIS LAST PERIOD,
IT'S BECOME MUCH MORE CONCENTRATED AND SEVERE.
IN VIEWING THE CONTEXT OF THIS OUTBREAK,
I KNEW I SHOULD CONSULT YOU.
- OW.
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE A FEVER.
- I DON'T?
- NO.
YOU PUT ON WEIGHT?
MAY I ASK THAT QUERY'S RELEVANCE?
IT'S HARDER ON YOUR BACK AS YOU GET FATTER.
SO, IN CONCERT WITH THE SYMPTOMS
I'M ALREADY EXHIBITING,
YOU'D SAY BE ALERT FOR FEVER?
AND WORK HARD ON YOUR PAPER.
- AND GET YOURSELF INOCULATED.
- UH-HUH.
AND TRY TO EAT LESS.
YOU BOTCHED THIS JOB PRETTY GOOD,
DIDN'T YOU, YOUNG LADY?
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME, IF YOU WANT,
I WILL DO THE JOB FOR YOU RIGHT.
BUT FIRST, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
THAT RICH WOMAN IS LEAVING TOWN,
AND SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD TAKE YOU WITH HER.
I KNOW THAT YOU THOUGHT ENOUGH OF THAT WOMAN
TO HELP HER GET OFF THIS...
STUFF
YOU TRIED TO USE TO KILL YOURSELF WITH.
BUT WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS, IS IF YOU WANTED TO DIE, PERIOD,
OR 'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T HAVE A WAY OUT OF HERE,
'CAUSE YOU DO HAVE A WAY OUT.
IS THAT A VOTE FOR NEW YORK CITY?
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
( door opens )
MORNING, MR. TOLLIVER.
GOOD MORNING, FLORA.
I SWEAR I SAW YOU LEAVE LAST NIGHT AFTER YOUR SHIFT.
I COME BACK.
A MAN WAS MURDERED WHERE MY BROTHER WORKS, AT THE GEM SALOON,
- AND I GOT SCARED.
- YOU SAW IT, HONEY?
YES, SIR.
I WAS THERE PICKING MY BROTHER UP.
YOU'RE BRAVE TO EVEN BE IN A JOINT LIKE THAT.
AND AFTER,
YOU SOUGHT REFUGE WITH JOANIE, DID YOU?
- YES, SIR.
- NO BETTER PORT IN A STORM.
- ANYWAYS, I'LL GO CHANGE.
- GOOD GIRL.
GOOD FOR YOU.
- YOU SETTLE IN REAL GOOD, FLORA.
- THANK YOU, SIR.
MM-MMM, JOANIE STUBBS.
IS THAT A FRESH SCALP I SEE HANGING FROM YOUR BELT?
SHE SAW A GUTTING LAST NIGHT.
SHE WAS UPSET.
I HELD HER.
Terrance:
I WAS WATCHING FOR YOU AT THE DOOR, FLORA,
BUT HERE YOU ARE ALREADY INSIDE.
NOT WORKING YET, TERRANCE.
POOR THING.
ADJUSTING SO SMOOTH TO LOSING HER CHERRY
AND YET THAT UPSET BY BLOOD.
SHE LOST HER CHERRY BACK HOME.
I TOLD YOU THAT.
GONNA PUT YOUR GARTERS ON NOW?
I'LL GIVE YOU $2 FOR THAT APPLE AND A PIECE OF CHEESE.
IT'S MY KNIFE.
YOU WANT TO BUY THAT?
I'VE GOT A FUCKING KNIFE.
I'LL JUST BE A SECOND AND TAKE MY BROTHER HIS LUNCH.
SURE, HONEY.
UNLESS SHE AIN'T UPSET AT ALL.
WHAT HAPPENED NOW, FLORA?
I THOUGHT YOU WAS CHANGIN' INTO YOUR GARTERS.
YOU GEEK-LOOKING FUCK.
GET AWAY FROM ME BEFORE I CUT YOUR FUCKING HEART OUT.
( knocks ) IT'S DR. COCHRAN.
DOCTOR.
TRIXIE TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE WITH LAUDANUM.
- MY GOD.
- SHE PUNCTURED HER VEIN.
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY SHE'S STILL ALIVE.
WHO'S WITH HER?
NO ONE AT THE GODDAMN MOMENT IS WITH HER, MRS. GARRET.
HER SITUATION IN THIS CAMP ISN'T SUCH THAT THAT WOULD BE SAFE.
WHICH IS WHY, WHILE TRYING TO DISSUADE HER
FROM FUTURE EFFORTS AT MURDERING HERSELF,
I TOLD A FIB,
INVOKING YOUR NAME AND WILLINGNESS
TO TAKE HER WITH YOU ON YOUR TRIP.
LAST NIGHT, DOCTOR,
I MADE THAT VERY OFFER TO TRIXIE.
SHE REFUSED.
MORE PRECISELY,
I OFFERED TO SEND TRIXIE TO NEW YORK
WITH THE CHILD TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE
INTRODUCTIONS TO MY FAMILY,
AND TO PAY TO SEE THEM ESTABLISHED.
IS IT POSSIBLE, MRS. GARRET,
THAT LEAVING THIS CAMP AND HEADING TO NEW YORK CITY
IN SERVICE TO YOU AND THE CHILD MIGHT,
TO A GIRL LIKE TRIXIE, APPEAR A MORE REALISTIC PROPOSITION
THAN BEING DISPATCHED ON SOME CRUEL MASQUERADE?
PLEASE TELL HER SHE'S WELCOME.
TELL HER SHE'S NECESSARY.
IF HER INDISPOSITION DOESN'T PRECLUDE IT,
I'D BE HAPPY TO TELL HER MYSELF.
THANK YOU, MADAM.
IF I'M TO GET MY THROAT CUT, DAN,
I'D RATHER NOT EXERT MYSELF FURTHER.
IF I HAVE ANY CHOICE IN THE MATTER,
I'D PREFER ONE BEHIND THE EAR.
KEEP CLIMBING, ELLSWORTH.
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK FOR SEEING THAT NEW YORK DUDE'S ACCIDENT.
WHEN SWEARENGEN WAS MOVED TO TRUST,
I KNOW YOU SPOKE FOR ME HARD.
WELL, I DIDN'T-- DIDN'T SPEAK AGAINST YOU.
YOU MIGHT TRY TAKIN' A GANDER OVER TO YOUR RIGHT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME WHERE TO FUCKING LOOK.
IF YOU'RE THE GODDAMN ASSAYER,
SHOULDN'T I BE FOLLOWING YOU?
HEAD ON BACK DOWN, MR. BULLOCK.
WE THINK WE FOUND A FORMATION WORTH LOOKING AT.
YOUNG LADY, THANK CHRIST.
I'D FEARED AFTER THE MURDER YOU'D SHUN US.
I COME FOR LUNCH WITH MILES.
WELL, BLESS YOU THEN FOR BEING A CARING SISTER.
- MILES!
- SIR?
MILES, YOU LUCKY SON OF A BITCH, YOUR SISTER'S HERE WITH YOUR LUNCH.
SHE BROUGHT YOU A FRESH APPLE
AND SOME KIND OF DELICACY WRAPPED IN SWADDLING.
I'VE BEEN SCRUBBING THAT BLOODSTAIN ALL MORNIN', AND THE CRIPPLE HAS TOO.
SITUATE YOUR SISTER TO SPARE HER TO STAND AT THAT FUCKING STAIN, HUH?
- LET'S DO IT.
- NOW?
- NOW, AND GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.
- WHAT IF--
FLORA, IF WE DO IT SLOW AND RIGHT,
- WE'RE 50 MILES GONE BEFORE ANYONE KNOWS WE BLEW.
- MY BOSS IS ONTO ME.
SAVVY OPERATOR FROM CHICAGO AND YOU COULD TELL HE'S ON TO YOU?
SAVVY ENOUGH THAT HE DIDN'T CRACK,
AND I STILL COULD FUCKING TELL.
YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.
YOU WANT TO DO IT FAST AND DIRTY
SO YOU HAVE TO CUT SOMEBODY'S THROAT.
- THIS JOINT YOU WANT TO TAKE?
- WHERE I WORK.
- WHERE YOUR BOSS IS ONTO YOU?
- I CAN MOVE THE DYKE.
HELD ME IN HER ARMS ALL NIGHT LIKE I WAS A LITTLE FUCKING KID.
CAN I ASSUME THERE'S A FUCKING PLAN?
MR. BULLOCK, WHAT HO?
MRS. GARRET'S ROOM.
NUMBER TWO.
DON'T SELL, MRS. GARRET.
DARLING...
UM, I'M GOING TO BE UNSPEAKABLY RUDE
AND LEAVE YOU HERE ALONE FOR JUST A MOMENT,
WHILE I GO DOWNSTAIRS WITH MR. BULLOCK,
WHO'S JUST ARRIVED WITH THE MOST INTERESTING NEWS,
AND WHOM I-
- I CAN'T RECEIVE HERE IN MY ROOM,
PARTICULARLY WITH YOU PRESENT,
FOR REASONS TOO BORING AND COMPLEX TO EXPLAIN.
SO I'M GOING TO GO DOWNSTAIRS TO SPEAK WITH MR. BULLOCK
IN MR. FARNUM'S ABSURD RESTAURANT,
THEN I'LL COME BACK UP
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO READY OUR LEAVING.
ALL RIGHT, DARLING?
I'LL BE IN THE RESTAURANT FOR JUST ONE MOMENT.
CAN I BRING YOU A GLASS OF MILK?
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL-
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
MAY I INQUIRE AS TO THE ASSAY'S OUTCOME?
- ASK THE OWNER.
- MRS. GARRET?
IS THE TECHNICAL TERM "BONANZA"?
THAT'S THE LOOK OF IT.
IT'S A BONANZA, MR. FARNUM.
I SEE.
CONGRATULATIONS.
( moans )
DOES THE FIND CHANGE YOUR MIND AT ALL ABOUT NEW YORK CITY?
I CAN'T SEE WHY IT WOULD.
I CAN'T, EITHER, BUT I DON'T COUNT.
OF COURSE YOU COUNT.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU?
'CAUSE YOUR CHANGES OF MIND COME SO QUICK AND OFTEN,
I CAN'T KEEP UP.
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND FROM YESTERDAY
WHEN IT WAS MADE UP TO STAY.
I WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND LAST NIGHT THAT MY REASONS
FOR WANTING TO STAY HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY SELFISH.
- BY WHO?
- TRIXIE.
I'D OFFERED TO SEND HER TO NEW YORK CITY WITH THE CHILD,
WHERE TRIXIE, I'VE SINCE COME TO REALIZE,
WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNSUITED.
AND BECAUSE I WISHED TO STAY HERE UNENCUMBERED
WHEN I SHOULD BE CARING FOR THE CHILD.
WHY CAN'T YOU CARE FOR HER HERE?
WHERE THE FUCK IS HE?
SAID HE WAS GONNA GO TELL THE WIDOW OF HER FIND.
HOW THE FUCK LONG DOES IT TAKE TO TELL HER?
I DON'T KNOW, AL, I'M HERE WITH YOU.
- WHAT, ARE YOU GETTING SMART WITH ME NOW?
- NO.
COCKSUCKER BULLOCK.
WHEN YOU CAN'T STAND THE SIGHT OF HIM,
HE'S NOWHERE BUT UNDERFOOT.
SIR, MY SISTER WAS TOLD OF A MAN
WHO RESEMBLES OUR FATHER'S PHOTOGRAPH DOWN BY LEAD,
AND I'D BE GRATEFUL IF THIS AFTERNOON
I COULD GO LOOK AND MAYBE I COULD TAKE A NIGHT SHIFT TO MAKE UP.
IF I SAID NO,
I'D HOPE YOU'D WALK OUT AND GO LOOKING ANYWAY,
THEN SEEK A NEW JOB ELSEWHERE AFTER.
THAT IS WHAT I'D DO, SIR.
ALL RIGHT, KID.
GO LOOK FOR HIM.
TELL ARNETTE AT THE LIVERY STABLE
I'LL STAND METAL FOR THE HORSE.
IF YOUR SISTER LOOKS WITH YOU, TELL ARNETTE I'M GOOD FOR HER MOUNT.
SO YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GO?
IT'S WHY THE FUCK YOU'RE HERE, ISN'T IT?
RIGHT.
I'M GONNA GO GET THE HORSES THEN.
PERMISSION TO LEAVE THE BAR, TROOPER.
THANKS, TO BOTH OF YOU.
AH, STRUCK RICH FOR THE WIDOW, HUH, BULLOCK?
FREE DRINK!
BIG, HUH?
RICH AND FUCKING THICK, THAT VEIN IS?
- NOT BEING EXPERT, I CAN'T GUESS AT THE EXTENT.
- DAN'S A FUCKING EXPERT.
WHEN HE'S NOT SHIT-FACED DRUNK, SO IS ELLSWORTH.
THE IMMEDIATE RESULT IS SHE WON'T BE SELLIN'.
OF COURSE, SHE FUCKING WON'T.
I SHOULD FUCKING THINK NOT, HUH?
NOT FOR ANY $20,000 AT LEAST.
COME HERE.
COME DRINK WITH YOUR VANQUISHED FOE.
Al:
VERY GOOD OF YOU AND MR. STAR, INCIDENTALLY,
TO MAKE YOUR VENUE AVAILABLE SO THE HOOPLE HEADS CAN GET VACCINATED.
I WAS THE SECOND HOOPLE HEAD STUCK.
THEM RIDERS THAT BROUGHT THE VACCINE,
SAY THE HEATHENS HAVE BEEN CALLED BACK TO THE AGENCY.
- IN A SPASM OF GOOD SENSE, THEY'RE FUCKING GOING.
- I HEARD.
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, WE'LL HAVE LAWS HERE AND EVERY OTHER THING.
YEAH, WHICH BRINGS ME, BULLOCK, TO THE MATTER OF THE WIDOW.
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU MY BONA FIDES FOR COOPERATION.
IF A TREATY IS SIGNED, BE WISE FOR YOU AND ME
TO PADDLE IN THE SAME DIRECTION.
TICS OR HABITS OF BEHAVIOR EITHER FINDS DISLIKABLE IN THE OTHER
GOTTA BE OVERLOOKED OR TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.
WOULD YOUR BONA FIDES EXTEND TO MRS. GARRET'S FUTURE SAFETY?
MY OATH ON THIS:
EVERY DAY THAT THE WIDOW SITS ON HER ASS IN NEW YORK CITY,
LOOKS WEST AT SUNSET AND THINKS TO HERSELF,
"GOD BLESS YOU IGNORANT COCKSUCKERS IN DEADWOOD,
WHO STRIVE MIGHTILY AND AT LITTLE MONEY
TO ADD TO MY EVER-INCREASING FORTUNE,"
SHE'LL BE SAFE FROM THE WILES OF AL SWEARENGEN.
SHE'S STAYIN'.
THE OATH STANDS AS A GESTURE TO YOU.
- CAN I TAKE A SHAVE OVER HERE?
- PLEASE.
BARNEY, BE CAREFUL IN THE AREA OF THE THROAT, HUH?
IF YOU AUTHORIZED AN OFFER OF 20 ON THE WIDOW'S CLAIM...
YOUR AGENT WAS LOOKING TO SKIM A LITTLE CREAM.
- HOW HIGH DID E.B. GO?
- $19,500.
I WOULDN'T TRUST A MAN THAT WOULDN'T TRY TO STEAL A LITTLE.
WHERE'S THAT FUCKING WHORE?
YOU STAY HERE, SWEETHEART.
I'M SO VERY SORRY...
FOR ANY PART THAT I MAY HAVE PLAYED IN THIS.
I DON'T REMEMBER YOU BEING THE ONE
THAT MADE ME A WHORE, MRS. GARRET.
I'M GOING TO STAY IN THE CAMP WITH THE CHILD, TRIXIE.
DR. COCHRAN EXPLAINED TO ME THE DIFFICULTIES
YOUR EXTRAORDINARY KINDNESS TOWARD ME
HAS PUT YOU IN, IN RELATIONSHIP TO MR. SWEARENGEN.
IF YOU WISH TO STAY,
I'D BE SO GRATEFUL IF YOU'D STAY WITH US.
BUT PERHAPS YOU WANT TO GO, TRIXIE.
IF YOU DO...
TAKE THIS.
AS YOUR EARNEST CLAIM ON THE FUTURE.
I'LL SEND YOU MORE.
I APPEAR TO HAVE STRUCK IT RICH.
I'LL SEND YOU ALL THAT YOU NEED.
Girl:
TRIXIE?
TRIXIE?
HELLO, SWEETHEART.
( whispers ) DON'T I LOOK TIRED?
SOPHIA.
SOPHIA.
SOPHIA.
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.
I SHOULD'VE GUESSED IT.
TAKE HER HOME, MRS. GARRET.
HOW DO YOU TAKE MY SUGGESTION?
ARE YOU SURE THAT GOLD'S REAL?
ABSOLUTELY.
UH, LET ME THINK THINGS THROUGH.
ALL RIGHT.
( door opens, closes )
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- ELIZABETH.
- I'M QUITTIN'.
- ALL RIGHT, FLORA.
I LEFT A PIN UP IN YOUR ROOM.
I WANNA GO LOOK FOR IT.
GO AHEAD AND LOOK.
WHEN DOES THE PART COME WHEN THAT LITTLE PIECE OF TRIM
FINALLY GETS INTO HER WORKING CLOTHES
AND STARTS MAKING US SOME FUCKING MONEY?
SHE'S QUITTING, CY.
SHE'S QUITTING?
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE YOUR ROOM SHE'S WALKING INTO YET AGAIN.
SHE LOST A PIN...
UP THERE.
A PIN?
CAN YOU TELL THE STONES FROM THE PASTE?
SHOW ME WHICH IS WHICH.
I DON'T THINK SO.
- LET ME TAKE IT.
- GET OUTTA HERE, FLORA.
PUT DOWN MY THINGS AND I'LL LET YOU GET OUT WITHOUT RAISING HELL.
WHY DON'T LET ME GO WITH YOUR THINGS
AND SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH?
BECAUSE I REMIND YOU OF WHOEVER THE FUCK I REMIND YOU OF.
NO.
NOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, FLORA, KILL ME?
- MAYBE.
- DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE?
I'LL GIVE IT A GODDAMN WHIRL.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET OUT ALIVE.
YOU'RE GONNA DIE HERE.
WHO AM I?
YOUR LITTLE BABY?
YOUR LITTLE SISTER?
YOU?
I WOULDN'T MOVE THIS.
- DID YOU FIND YOUR PIN?
- I DID, SIR.
JOANIE TELLS ME YOU'RE LEAVING US.
CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, SIR.
DECIDED I WASN'T CUT OUT FOR IT.
MY BROTHER TOO.
DECIDED HE WASN'T CUT OUT FOR WHAT?
SWEEPING UP AT THE GEM SALOON.
( chuckling ) I SEE.
MY FIRST TAKE ON YOUR MEANING WAS THEY WERE FUCKING YOUR BROTHER
FOR MONEY OVER THERE LIKE YOU WAS GETTIN' DONE TO HERE.
- STEP ASIDE AND LET ME DO MY BUSINESS.
- ( door closes )
AND WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS?
!
YOU WITH YOUR BEADY LITTLE FERRET EYES.
SHE CAME TO SAY GOODBYE, CY.
SHE'S MOVING ON.
IT DON'T FEEL RIGHT TO ME, BABE.
( grunts )
BUT IF I'M MISTAKEN IN MY JUDGMENT,
MAY I REGRET WHAT I JUST DID FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
- NOW LET HER GO!
- ( grunts )
- ( Flora screaming )
- YOU LITTLE CUNT!
YOU'RE GONNA DIE HERE!
( continues screaming )
COME ON!
GET OUTTA HERE.
GET OUT.
GET OUT FRONT.
GET AROUND!
THEY'RE GOIN' OVER THE TOP!
COME ON.
DON'T IMPEDE HER PROGRESS, JOANIE.
DON'T DO NOTHING RASH.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!
THEM TWO ROBBED MY JOINT.
THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GONNA BE DEALT WITH.
I GUESS THEY NEEDN'T GET BEAT ANYMORE OUT HERE.
TAKE 'EM THE FUCK INSIDE, BOYS.
AND YOU CAN HELP YOUR DELICATE SENSIBILITIES
BY TURNING THE FUCK AWAY.
CY WANTS YOU UP THERE, HONEY.
Al:
I TELL YOU, YOUR FACE COME OUT OF THAT IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.
- MATTERS TOOK A HAPPY TURN, YOU COULD STILL PROBABLY WORK.
- ( door opens )
COME ON IN, HONEY,
OVER HERE ON WHAT THE DAGOS CALL MY SINISTER SIDE,
ALTHOUGH YOUR BEADY LITTLE RAT EYES
DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY'RE TAKING IN THE VIEW.
YOU BUST SOMETHING UP THERE, SWEETHEART?
!
DOES THAT FUCKIN' HURT YOU?
!
YOU FUCKIN' UNDERSTAND ME?
!
SEE, THAT UPSETS JOANIE NOW.
"OH, CY, DO UP THE BOY.
MY GOD, I CAN'T STAND TO SEE THE OTHER."
YOU WANT ME TO SEE TO THE BOY, JOANIE?
'CAUSE YOU KNOW I'M CLAY IN YOUR HANDS.
- CY.
- WHAT IS IT, EDDIE?
WE COULD ALL BE ELSEWHERE?
NOTHING BUT TRUE.
ARE YOU AWAKE, MILES?
DON'T BE FUCKING PASSING OUT, YOUNGSTER.
NEXT BREATH YOU DRAW, THE SMELL OF SULFUR'S
LIABLE TO BE STRONG IN YOUR NOSE.
WHERE IS YOUR FUCKING NOSE, ANYWAY?
FUCK IT, MILES!
YOU'RE FOUND FUCKIN' GUILTY OF BEING A CUNT.
I'M HEREBY PASSING JUDGMENT
FOR YOUR LETTIN' THIS BITCH PUSH YOU AROUND AND TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO
WHEN YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A MAN AND SHOWING HER RULES!
YOU HEAR ME, MILES?
AND FOR BEING THE CUNT YOU ARE NOW,
BEFORE YOU COULD HAVE BEEN A MAN,
DONE YOUR FUCKING PART, YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT.
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT OUT OF HERE, JOANIE.
- DON'T HURT HER, CY.
- DON'T HURT HER?
YOU MEAN BEFORE I KILL HER?
YES.
LISTEN TO THAT, FLORA.
THAT'S THE PERSON YOU ROBBED,
WHO HAD THOSE KIND OF FEELINGS FOR YOU.
BUT I'M THE ONE YOU STABBED.
SEE?
I THINK YOUR FUCKIN' SKULL'S BROKEN, FLORA.
YOU'RE TRYING FOR THE KNIFE.
IT'S MAYBE A FOOT TO YOUR LEFT.
THIS IS FUCKING PITIFUL.
WHY DON'T YOU PUT THAT OUT OF ITS MISERY?
( moaning )
- ( gunshot ) - ( grunts )
DON'T DO NOTHIN'.
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO WILL BE A MISTAKE.
YOU KEEP DRAWING BREATH RIGHT HERE.
( piano playing )
YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD, E.B.,
TO PRESERVE OUR FUCKING INTERESTS.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE CARDS GO COLD.
FAR AS THE EVENTS AT THE BELLA UNION,
BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IT WAS TWO YOUNG THIEVES,
A BOY AND A GIRL.
WE ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE.
WHO THEY ARE NOW IS LATE NIGHT VITTLES FOR WU'S PIGS.
THAT YOUNG GIRL HAD ME FOOLED.
YOUR DICK HAD YOU FOOLED.
AND IN THAT STATE OF ADDLEMENT,
YOU MISTOOK HER PURPOSE, HER SO-CALLED BROTHER'S
AND THEIR ENTIRE FUCKING COCKEYED STORY.
YOU DID DO EVERYTHING YOU COULD, DIDN'T YOU, E.B.?
YOU WENT TO THE LIMIT ON OUR OFFER.
- EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE.
- YOU DID GO TO THE LIMIT?
WELL, I WENT TO THE LIMIT'S PRECIPICE.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU DIDN'T GO TO THE LIMIT.
AL, I HELD BACK A FEW DOLLARS,
AGAINST SOME FINAL UNFORESEEN TURN.
SO WE'LL NEVER KNOW IF THEM FEW DOLLARS
YOU HELD BACK WOULDN'T HAVE MADE US BOTH FUCKING RICH.
I'M GOING UP.
FIND OUT HOW MUCH TOLLIVER PAID WU.
DON'T WANT TO BE SUCKIN' HIND TIT ON DISPOSAL FEES.
DON'T THINK I ENJOYED THAT BULLSHIT, JOANIE.
CERTAIN THINGS YOU...
HAVE TO DO TO IMPRESS UPON PEOPLE
WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO DO.
DO YOU LIKE IT?
NO.
DO YOU ENJOY IT?
NO.
DO YOU HAVE TO LOOK LIKE YOU DO?
YES.
I GOT EDDIE IN THERE.
GOTTA LET HIM KNOW.
CAPRA'S DOWNSTAIRS, GONNA HEAR ABOUT IT.
WHEN PEOPLE COME TO ROB YOU, JOANIE, YOU GOTTA GET ROUGH.
IF IT LOOKS LIKE AN ACT, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
AND THEN I GRAB YOUR HAND...
AND I THINK, "MY GOD, THIS POOR FUCKING GIRL."
BUT I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO IN THAT ROOM.
AND NOW I'M OUT HERE.
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOUR HAPPINESS IS IMPORTANT TO ME,
AND WHATEVER THE FUCK I GOTTA DO,
IF YOU'RE TOO MUCH IN MY SHADOW,
IF I MAKE THINGS TOO TOUGH ON YOU, THEN WE'LL STOP IT.
- WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING ELSE.
- CY.
YOU BRING WARMTH INTO MY LIFE.
I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE YOU UNHAPPY LIKE THIS.
I WANT...
TO SET YOU UP IN YOUR OWN BUSINESS HERE.
INDEPENDENT FUCKING OPERATOR.
I'LL PUT UP THE MONEY.
ANY KIND OF INTEREST IN RETURN, THAT'S FINE,
BUT THAT AIN'T WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
IT'LL BE YOUR PLACE.
I WANT YOU TO FEEL WHEN I WALK IN THERE
THAT YOU CAN SAY, "I'M BUSY, CY.
COME BACK LATER."
I WANT YOU TO WATCH ME TURN AROUND WHEN YOU SAY THAT
LIKE I'M SOME RUBE TRICK WITH MY CHIN DOWN ON THE FLOOR,
"WHEN SHOULD I TRY YOU AGAIN, JOANIE?"
"I'LL LET YOU KNOW, CY."
THAT'S HOW I WANT YOU TO FEEL.
I USED TO MAKE YOU WARM, DIDN'T I, CY?
AND I COULD MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S FUNNY.
YOU STILL DO, HONEY.
WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY, YOU STILL DO.
KILL ME TOO, CY,
OR LET ME GO.
I UNDERSTOOD MYSELF TO BE SAYIN', JOANIE,
I WANT TO FIND A WAY TO GIVE YOU A LOOSER REIN.
YOU'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MEAN IT.
IF YOU DON'T KILL ME OR LET ME GO,
I'M GONNA KILL YOU.
HAS HE GOT YOU AT YOUR HANDS AND KNEES AT 2:00 IN THE FUCKING MORNING?
I GOT MYSELF AT MY HANDS AND KNEES,
WONDERING WHAT BECAME OF YOU.
WAKE UP, DAVID.
I'M UP.
* ROW, ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT *
* GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM *
* MERRILY, MERRILY, MERRILY, MERRILY *
* LIFE IS BUT A DREAM *
( door opening )
( country ballad playing )
* I WAS A-STANDIN' BY MY WINDOW *
* OH ONE COLD AND CLOUDY DAY *
* WHEN I SAW THAT HEARSE COME ROLLIN' *
* FOR TO CARRY MY MOTHER AWAY *
* WILL A CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN?

* BY AND BY, LORD, BY AND BY *
* THERE'S BETTER HOME AWAY *
* IN THE SKY, LORD, IN THE SKY. *
( theme music playing )
ALL RIGHT.
I HAD A HAPPY JUST LIKE THAT.
IF HE''D SELL THE HORSE IS WHAT HE REALLY WANTS TO KNOW.
BUT THE FUCKIN'' JERK'' S IN THAT BUNKHOUSE.
- THANK YOU.

PROBABLY SPOKE OF KILLIN'' WILD BILL HICKOK.
. WELL, WE''RE BILL HICKOK''S FRIENDS
THAT''D BE AS FAIR A PLAY AS YOU GAVE HIM.
BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR OFFER?
IF YOU GOT A DIFFERENT IDEA, YOU CAN RIDE AHEAD.

WITH SO MUCH SHOWING, IT''S PRETTY NEAR FALLIN'' APART.
THIRD FROM THE MIDDLE.
SHE PASSED.
- Boy:

AS REGRETS FOR ME BEING SUCH A RUFFIAN.
HERE YOU GO, HONEY.

( man coughing )
IT''S ALL RIGHT, SON . IT''S ALL RIGHT.

- ALL RIGHT.
- THANK YOU.
I GOT CLOTHES FOR YOU BACK HERE.
- YOU''RE ON YOUR OWN FOR ALTERATIONS.

Trixie:

WAIT, WAIT IN HERE, WITH TRIXIE.

- GUESS I LEARNPRETTY QUICK.
MAESTRO.
FROM WHEREVER WE MAY BE PUT TO REST.

OUR STRIVING WOULD BE LOSING ?

HER TINY SELF ALL BUT SWALLOWED UP IN HORSESHIT?
HEY, KID!
COME HERE.

WHAT ARE-- WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WAITING.
THREE BIG-TITTIED WHORES WILL NOW EMERGE FROM BEHIND THAT SCREEN.
HANGING UPSIDE DOWN LIKE A FUCKING BAT, HMM?
HOW DARE YOU SUGGEST I''D MEAN A THING LIKE THAT, HUH?
I EXPECT SHE''LL WANNA TAKE COUNSEL WITH HIM.
I TRUST YOU KNOW 2% OF NOTHING''S FUCKING NOTHING.
HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF YOUR OWN.
OTHERWISE I''M STAYING ON.
I''M SO SORRY YOU WERE HURT.
SO, HOW HARD ARE THEY COMING AT YOU TO SELL?
I''VE HAD A WEAKNESS IN THAT DIRECTION.
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I''D SAY THAT''S COMING PRETTY HARD.
. THAT''S ALL RIGHT
I WAS INOCULATED IN NEW YORK CITY.
THANK YOU.
YOU ARE CHANGED.
WE''D-LIKE-TO-GET- ACQUAINTED-WITH SALE.
MR. UTTER.
MIGHTY GRATEFUL, SIR.
SAVING THE LAST MASTER-STROKES FOR SETH.
AS MUCH AS SHE FAVORS YOU, SHE COULD BE YOURS.

CONGRATULATIONS, SIR, ON YOUR ADVANCED THINKING.
AL WANTS YOU, TRIXIE.
STICKLER FOR SELF-DELIVERED MESSAGES.
I KNOW IT, EVEN IF MY BROTHER DON''T.
HE''D NEVER THINK THAT, THOUGH, MY BROTHER.
I HAD A BOYFRIEND IN BUFFALO.
I WAS UPSET.
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A STUPID SON OF A BITCH.
AND ROUGH.
HERE.
ALL THAT WAY IN DEFENSE OF YOUR VIRTUE?
THAT''S MORE TROUBLE THAN I EVER TOOK WITH IT.
CY.
LAZARUS RISEN.
HELLO, CY.
HIGHLY BECOMING OUTFIT.
I''M HERE FOR MY BELONGINGS.
MEASURES TO STOP THE SPREAD.
- ANDY?
- IN THE FLESH, SWEETHEART.
BETTER THAN TO THROW HIM IN THE WOODS TO FUCKING DIE?
THEN DON''T THINK ABOUT NOTHING, ANDY.
AND A TOOT AND GO JOIN THE FUCKING CIRCUS.
IF WE HAVE TO KILL THE COCKSUCKER.
THAT''S AN INTERESTING PIECE OF STRANGE.
( knocking )
AIN''T YOU A PICTURE?
- WHAT IS IT?
- HMM?
AM I FUCKING IMPOSING?
MRS. GARRET''S TO SIT DOWN WITH BULLOCK.
OR DO YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING TO ME?
AFTER YOU LIED ABOUT HER TAKING DOPE, HUH?
AND SHE WANTED TO GET OFF THE DOPE.
AND THAT LITTLE ONE NEEDS SOMEONE TO CARE FOR HER...
AND MAYBE GET HER THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.
AND I KNEW IT WASN''T GONNA BE ME.
AND TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY FUCKING DECIDE?
OR DO YOU WANNA RIP MY FUCKING GUTS OUT?
YOU GET BACK THERE QUICK.
DON''T GET A MISTAKEN IDEA.
MR. UTTER.
THIS IS WHERE BILL GOT KILLED, HUH?
I''LL BE SORRY ABOUT THAT FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE.
YEAH.
MR. HICKOK PLUM GUTTED McCALL AT DRAW.
AND IN COME THAT COWARD McCALL.
WALKED UP ON HIM AND SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD.
BILL NEVER KNOW WHEN HE COME IN.
WE DIDN''T HAVE NO INKLING OF WHAT HE INTENDED.
Man:
IF I MAY, SIR...
AND I LOST SEVERAL SECONDS TO PAIN BEFORE REGAINING MY SENSES.
THEY FEARED CRIPPLED ME IN THE HAND I USE TO WRITE.
I WILL TAKE THE MURDERER''S BULLET TO MY GRAVE.
THANKS.
THAT IS THE HAND THAT WILD BILL HAD.
SURE, CAPTAIN.
SURE.
YOU LIKE HOW THAT FALLS?
- DO YOU LIKE IT, FLORA?
- WHY NOT?
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO THAT MIGHT BE, FLORA.
THERE YOU GO.
I PREFER YOU HAPPY.
OR AT LEAST PRETENDING BETTER?
I THINK HE''S DEAD, DOC.
COULD YOU TELL THE LITTER BEARERS NOT TO MAKE SO MUCH OF GETTING THIS ONE OUTTA HERE?
- HAS YOUNG JOEY GONE TO DUST?
- YEAH.
TO BE RESTORED BY THE SAVIOR''S RETURN.
- ARE YOU DRUNK?

( groaning )
ALL RIGHT.
YOU''RE ALL RIGHT, REVEREND.
ALL RIGHT.
AND GENERATING YOUR CHATS WITH THE GODDAMN DIVINITY.
NO GODDAMN OFFENSE INTENDED.

I''LL BE RECEIVIN G AROUND NOON.
YOU''RE SWELL.
EVENING.
EVENING, MISS.
LET ME GET YOU A PLACE TO SIT AWAY FROM THESE ROUGH SONS OF BITCHES.
DO YOUR DRINKING AT THE BAR OR GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
YOU HAVE A SEAT HERE.
- CIDER IF IT''S NOT A TROUBLE.
- SOFT CIDER.
DID SHE FIND HER DAD?
YOU GOT IT?
MUST BE HIS THINKING ON THAT SUBJECT.
. I''D GUESS YOU DID TOO
SO HE HAD TO KILL ME FOR THAT TOO.
IT JUST HAPPENED OUT THE WAY IT HAPPENED OUT.
AFTER BEATING HIM TILL I COULDN''T RECOGNIZE HIS FACE.
FOR CHRIST''S SAKE!
- I''LL TELL YOU THAT FUCKING MUCH.
- NOT FOR LONG.
-WHOSE?
- SWEARENGEN''S.
GET HIS OPINION, TOO, WHO SHOULD GUARD THAT HENHOUSE WE''RE GONNA BUILD.
- YES, AND YOU?
- YES.
. AND MR. SWEARENGEN, HE''S FUNNY AS ALL GET-OUT
SO WHAT PLACE WOULD MAKE A BETTER SCORE?
WHERE I''M WORKING.
BUT WHY NOT TAKE ''EM BOTH?
- COULD WE HAVE A PRIVATE TALK?
- SURE WE CAN.
COME HERE.
I THINK THAT SON OF A BITCH BETTER STOP LOOKING EVIL AT THAT LITTLE GIRL.
I''M HERE TO TALK ABOUT MRS. GARRET.
. I''D BE COMING AFTER YOU
- YOU WOULD?
- YEAH.
I AIN''T INVOLVED.
FARNUM''S YOUR WATER-BOY AND I KNOW WHAT YOU''VE BEE N TRYING TO DO TO HER.
SO HERE YOU COME IN ALL NOBILITY...
OR I COME FOR YOU.
AND YOU BETTER HAVE SOMEONE TO HAND THE TASK OFF TO WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES.
Man:
AL!
AL!
SO I CAN SHUT MY FUCKING OFFICE.
( gagging )
OR SHOULD I HAVE HAD HIM HOLD HIM UP?
YOU HEARD ME TOO.
Man #2:
THAT''S ME!
I''M SORRY, MR. SWEARENGEN.
I WARNED HIM.
FUCKING PUSSY.
BEEN SUFFERING AWFUL.
AND IN THE DUMBEST LOOKING OUTFIT A GROWN MAN EVER WORE.
WHO THE HELL''S IT LOOK LIKE?
HOW THE FUCK DO I KNOW WHO IT FUCKING LOOKS LIKE?
IT''S DARK!
JESUS CHRIST, COME UPON A PERSON UNAWARES IN A FUCKING GRAVEYARD!
I HEARD YOU WAS BACK IN THE CAMP.
I HEARD YOU AND THAT BULLOCK GOT THE COCKSUCKER DID FOR BILL.
WAS BILL DEAD BY THE TIME YOU SAW HIM?
YEAH, HE WAS ALREADY DEAD.
I DON''T KNOW, CHARLIE.
I COME UP HERE NIGHTS TELL HIM THE FUCKING NEWS.
GO AHEAD.
TELL HIM WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I GOT THAT MAIL ROUTE IN CHEYENNE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.
AND I RUN INTO THAT BULLOCK FELLA.
THAT-
- THAT KILLED YOU.
HE GOT F-F--
FUCK.
CAN I--
CAN I TELL HIM SOME MORE TOMORROW?
I DON''T MAKE THE RULES.
WANNA GO BACK TO THE CAMP?
PLEASE.
AT LEAST HE KEPT A DECENT PRIVACY.
I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE GEM.
WOULD YOU WANNA TAKE THE GIRL AND GO?
WHERE?
WHAT THE FUCK?
YOU WANNA FUCK THIS MAN?
DON''T YOU WANNA SAY TO REMEMBER MY PLACE?
AND I''M GOING BACK TO IT.
SHE''S ABOUT TO SAY HER NAME, YOU KNOW.
THINK OF SELLING.
IF YOU TOOK HER AWAY, YOU COULD HEAR HER SAY IT.
?
OLD FRIEND ?
?
OLD FRIEND ?
?
IT MIGHT BE EASY FOR ANOTHER MAN TO SEE ?
?
OLD FOOL ?
?
OLD FOOL ?
?
IT MIGHT BE EASY FOR ANOTHER MAN TO SEE ?
?
BUT I THINK YOU STILL LOOK A LOT LIKE ME. ?
That's what McCall was ridin'.
All right.
Evening.
Evening back.
Look at that paint, Charlie.
I seen it.
I had a happy just like that.
Foundered.
- Makes me miserable reminiscing on it.
- Do you know the owner?
If he'd sell the horse is what he really wants to know.
Well, I don't know if he'd sell.
But the fuckin' jerk's in that bunkhouse.
- Thank you.
- Evenin'.
Jack McCall.
I'm done.
I don't wanna play no more.
Bein' a loudmouth cunt,
I guess some time since he's been here,
This fella who don't wanna play no more
Probably spoke of killin' Wild Bill Hickok.
Well, we're Bill Hickok's friends.
- I'm Seth Bullock.
- I'm Charlie Utter.
And if you got your head blown off sitting' here with your back turned,
That'd be as fair a play as you gave him.
Guess you wanna soften him up some
Before you make your offer?
My plan is to take him to Yankton for trial.
If you got a different idea, you can ride ahead.
Nah.
Let's take the cocksucker to Yankton.
I don't know of a Henry Anderson in camp,
But that don't mean there ain't.
This was took of him in the union army.
He'd be 12 years older now.
Could you let her hold it?
With so much showing, it's pretty near falling' apart.
Here.
Third from the middle.
Right uh...
right there?
Yeah.
That face don't- Don't look familiar.
Thanks for lookin'.
You definite he's in these hills?
Wrote from Bismarck,
Said he'd send for us when he got set up.
Man:
I just gotta say
It's no guarantee your dad's anywhere near this area.
And there's no fuckin' joy in me telling you that,
But it's the goddamned truth and the way human beings are.
- He said he'd send for our mother and us.
- Is your mama here?
She passed.
Sorry.
Well, good luck.
Do you know of- Of work for me?
- No.
- She can get work right here.
- Boy: no, sir.
- Girl: no, thank you.
- Can you push a broom?
- And I could start now.
Four bits a day.
I bet you'd like the first in advance.
If you wouldn't mind.
Same for her,
As regrets for me being such a ruffian.
Here you go, honey.
If I don't fire him first, you can pick him up at 10:00.
Thank you, sir.
I'll wait for you, miles.
Find a safe place to wait, you hear?
We teach a special sweeping' technique here.
Follow her lead.
It's all right, son.
It's all right.
Um... excuse me.
I'm required to be at the graveyard.
The widow garret is laying her husband to rest.
I'd have bet a month's wages that burial
Would've took place in New York City,
If I had a fuckin' paying' job.
The uh... wet cloth to his lips
Seems to give him some relief.
- All right.
- Thank you.
What do you think of my patient, doc?
You might wanna steer clear of his reflection for a while,
But you're symptom-Free.
You ain't contagious no more
And you can't get re-Infected, so-
- Them as heals under my care stay fuckin' healed.
- Thanks, doc.
I got clothes for you back here.
Hereafter in calamity, I'll be sure to call for Jane.
you gonna stick around the camp?
I believe I will for a while.
Good, 'cause I wanna monitor your activities,
Find out what you do that weighs so heavy on your conscience.
When I first come on you in the woods,
All you could say was, "I apologize. "
Before you exhibit your Johnson, I'm gonna see to this fella.
So long.
Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you.
- All right.
- You're on your own for alterations.
- Hmm.
Now I'm gonna lay this cloth on your fuckin' lips.
Trixie: there's Mr. Star to collect us.
Mr. Star has been ever so attentive.
- Very considerate.
- To you.
- When we leave the hotel, my boss will be watchin'.
- Shall I reel and stagger?
I...
I know the risk lying to him has put you to.
I've
- I can't imagine why I'd make it the subject of humor.
You're feeling better.
- Am I early?
- Good morning, Mr. Star.
I'll be ready in just a moment.
- I can have a cup of coffee downstairs.
- No, not at all.
Wait, wait in here, with Trixie.
I'll just be a moment.
That widow ain't high.
Maybe waiting till after the service.
When she'd wanna get good and fucking loaded is before the fucking service,
Against all the fucking carrying on.
- What do you think?
- Makes sense.
Meaning all that whore's been telling me the last 10 fucking days
About seeing the widow taking the dope, and your own fucking assurances,
You verify that she's loaded personally
- You're both full of shit.
I checked in on the woman daily.
If I was fooled, perhaps I've chosen simplemindedness, Al,
Over realizing a certain friend
Has used me as an instrument of purposes he concealed.
Say what you're gonna say,
Or prepare for eternal fucking silence.
I don't believe you commissioned me
To make an offer on the widow's claim
To keep the regulators off you, Al.
I think someone found something out there you want.
Assume you ain't been privy
To the ins and outs of that matter
For the sake of fucking conversation, huh?
I mean, was I asleep, e.
B.,
When you and me declared undying loyalty
And full faith mutual disclosure
About every fucking detail of every fucking move
- We were ever gonna fucking make together?
- You used me as a pawn, Al.
And you fucked up the game is the central fucking present issue.
We agreed on 2,000.
You want a fucking percentage instead?
Is that such an inconceivable proposition?
- Yeah, you got a percentage, e.
B.
- How big?
Two percent of the first million, half a percent after.
You wanna feel a damp palm, Al,
Select either of these hands.
Just get to the funeral, e.
B. Go to 20 if you have to.
Just get that fucking claim.
20 if I have to.
My word.
What a handsome man.
Wish I could tell you I recognize him.
Thank you anyway.
- Your dad, I expect.
- Yes.
You have reason to think he's out here?
He wrote us from Bismarck he'd be prospecting the hills.
- "Us" being?
- My brother.
He just got work over here.
Good for him.
So it's just the two of you?
Our mother passed, why we come from buffalo.
- And you're out here looking for your dad.
- Yes.
- Uh, Henry?
- Yes.
Out here looking for her father, Eddie.
Her and her older brother.
Got a photograph, I don't...
I don't recognize the likeness.
No.
- Henry Anderson?
- Yes.
- Yeah, I don't recognize him.
- Mm.
What are you gonna do while your brother works?
Work too, while we're looking to set aside, if we have to move on.
Ah, if dad doesn't turn up here.
Yeah, what do you do?
Cook, clean, sew, sweep.
Uh-Huh.
- How quick do you learn?
- Guess I learn pretty quick.
Maestro.
We are strangers and sojourners.
Mr. Garret's burial place
Is a great distance from New York City.
But his heart...
Ingrid...
Marta.
- And on the great day...
- Mama.
- His father will take him into it.
- Papa.
As he will all who confess his son savior
From wherever we may be put to rest.
Our hymn is "a mighty fortress. "
* a mighty fortress is our god * * a bulwark never failing... *
- My sympathies, madam, - * our helper...
But, my own requirements force me
To ignore what's seemly.
I must decide where to place my capital.
Might raising my offer to say, $19,500, uh,
Prompt you to an immediate answer?
- No, Mr. Farnum.
- * doth seek to work us woe * * lord Sabbath, his name *
- * his craft and power...
- I would as soon not see Bill now.
I'll see him some other time.
Come on.
* on earth is not his equal... *
I will require a decision within 24 hours-
Please, stop speaking to me, Mr. Farnum.
* did we in our own strength confide * * our striving would be losing *
* were not the right man by our side... * * the man of god's own choosing. *
I hope you ain't gived up on that little runt of a girl, Al.
Oh, do you worry for her, Dan?
Wandering the muck of our thoroughfare,
Her tiny self all but swallowed up in horseshit?
Hey, kid!
Come here.
- Yes, sir?
- Stand with us here a second.
What are- What are we doing?
Waiting.
Al: and out the door he'll go,
And prompt as a Swiss fucking timepiece
Three big-tittied whores will now emerge from behind that screen.
He lines 'em up at two-Foot intervals,
Smock tops down,
And all but sprints past 'em,
Giving their titties a lick.
And if he misses a titty,
Does not let himself retrace his steps.
- Don't tell me.
- Yeah, and then he goes on his way home,
Relieved for the day.
What's your name?
It's miles, huh?
- Miles, yeah.
- Yeah.
Strange, huh, miles?
But something you gotta know about specialists.
They pay a premium
And they never cause fucking trouble.
I sometimes imagine in my declining years running a small joint
In Manchester, England, catering to specialists exclusive.
And to let 'em know they're amongst their own, I'll operate from the corner,
Hanging upside down like a fucking bat, hmm?
- Oh, we're not such bad sorts here, huh, miles?
- No, sir.
So do you wanna ask your sister if she'd like to reconsider, hmm?
- You don't really mean that, Mr. Swearengen.
- Of course I don't mean it.
How dare you suggest I'd mean a thing like that, huh?
I did my part.
Raised our offer to 20 and demanded answer within the day.
But what, you cocksucker?
Complications have ensued:
Bullock's come back.
I expect she'll wanna take counsel with him.
Tell the whore I wanna see her.
And I trust this doesn't alter our agreement.
I trust you know 2% of nothing's fucking nothing.
That fella from Montana
I knew to trust won't be able to assay your claim.
- I see.
- We'll engage someone local, and I'll keep an eye on him.
As I've decided to stay in camp, Mr. Bullock,
At least for the near term,
I hope you'll feel absolved of those responsibilities
Towards my interest that you undertook at Mr. Hickok's request.
I prefer to see 'em through.
They're properly mine.
I even feel marginally capable of shouldering them
And I certainly realize that you and Mr. Star
Have responsibilities of your own.
Are you firing me, Mrs. Garret?
I'm offering you absolution.
Otherwise I'm staying on.
I'm so sorry you were hurt.
So, how hard are they coming at you to sell?
I could confide
That in an effort to blur my judgment,
Mr. Swearengen engaged intermediaries
To indulge me with opium.
But that would entail acknowledging that
I've had a weakness in that direction.
Uh...
More appropriately, uh, I could add
At the graveyard Mr. Farnum raised his offer
$7,500,
Presumably also on Mr. Swearengen's instruction,
And set a 24-Hour limit to my reply.
Under the circumstances, I'd say that's coming pretty hard.
Please forgive me for making you uncomfortable, Mr. Bullock.
I had better manners before I began to abstain.
That's all right.
Anyways, are you at risk for the smallpox?
I was inoculated in New York City.
The child whose life you saved presumably has not been,
But I assume she's safer under my care
Than traveling in a covered wagon with strangers.
Anyways, I'll line up the assayer.
Thank you.
You are changed.
You seem to be too.
Our stock's depleted, but we are offering a 100% discount
On any item that catches your eye.
I've got money.
Our special get- Acquainted-With-Those-
We'd-Like-To-Get- Acquainted-With sale.
Mr. Utter.
I brought these pickaxes for you to sell.
There's two sifters on that black cayuse out there.
Mighty grateful, sir.
You got this place just about built, don't you?
Saving the last master-Strokes for Seth.
Oh, hello.
I didn't see you.
Hello.
Hey, that's that little girl, isn't it?
Taking care of her for Mrs. Garret.
As much as she favors you, she could be yours.
I lost the receipts for my costs.
Maybe while you was busy saving my partner's life.
Let me get these sifters for you.
See if you can make those accounts add up.
I don't know if you heard me inside
Thanking you for helping my friend.
I heard you.
It's all right.
I'm sorry you lost yours.
All right.
Thank you.
Welcome back, Mr. Utter.
We've had a mild increase in rates,
But I do have a room available.
I'll see.
What do you want, Mr. Farnum?
I have a message for Trixie
That's looking to that orphan child.
- She's to see her longer-Term employer.
- I'll tell her.
You know who that is?
I know she works at the gem.
And even so, admit her to your trade at public hours.
Congratulations, sir, on your advanced thinking.
Al wants you, Trixie.
Stickler for self-Delivered messages.
Our dad ain't here.
I know it, even if my brother don't.
Maybe he never even tried to get here.
Or maybe he did try to get here and couldn't,
Maybe something happened to him.
There's so many ways it could be, flora,
It's not much point deciding which it was.
He'd never think that, though, my brother.
Must be how he needs to do.
I ain't a virgin-
If you wanna know that.
I had a boyfriend in buffalo.
Well, was you upset to have to leave him?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
I was upset.
At the same time he was a stupid son of a bitch.
And rough.
Here.
You can't tell my brother about him.
He'd make it back to buffalo and shoot Lewis in the head.
All that way in defense of your virtue?
That's more trouble than I ever took with it.
Cy.
Lazarus risen.
Look at you, you son of a gun.
Hello, Cy.
Good to see you, Andy.
Don't be afraid to shake with me, Eddie.
I ain't contagious no more.
Highly becoming outfit.
I'm here for my belongings.
Look...
They're gone, Andy.
Measures to stop the spread.
Ah hell, the important thing is you're well.
I'll front you whatever you need.
Let's get something going, hmm?
- Andy?
- In the flesh, sweetheart.
- Which ain't much to look at.
- You made it, Andy.
Oh, and we ain't getting nothing going.
All I come back for, Cy, was my things,
And you tossed them too.
Why don't you take this and get yourself outta that clown outfit?
Once you've cooled off a little,
Think how you'd have done different when somebody showed up
In the shape you was in and my responsibilities to meet.
Better than to throw him in the woods to fucking die?
Then don't think about nothing, Andy.
Use the money for a whore
And a toot and go join the fucking circus.
Did you turn her out?
Her brother's gonna be a problem.
Fuck her brother.
We'll handle the brother
If we have to kill the cocksucker.
That's an interesting piece of strange.
Ain't you a picture?
- What is it?
- Hmm?
Oh, am I detaining you in some way?
Am I fucking imposing?
Mrs. Garret's to sit down with Bullock.
I thought you'd want me over there.
Oh yeah, so you can bring me a full and fair report, huh?
But will the widow have her wits about her, Trixie, huh?
Or will they be passing the opium pipe
Like heathens between 'em, her and fucking Bullock, hmm?
- What're you pissed off for?
- I ain't pissed off.
I'm in fucking wonderment.
I'm waiting to be kept happy by the next fucking fairy tale.
Do you want me back at the hotel
Or do you wanna do something to me?
Now why would I want you to go back there, huh?
Or rely on anything you said transpired
After you lied about her taking dope, huh?
Her being high...
Wasn't gonna have nothing to do
With whether or not she sold you that claim,
And she wanted to get off the dope.
And that little one needs someone to care for her...
And maybe get her the fuck outta here.
And I knew it wasn't gonna be me.
So you want me back over there
And to tell you what they fucking decide?
Or do you wanna rip my fucking guts out?
You get back there quick.
Don't kid yourself, Trixie.
Don't get a mistaken idea.
Mr. Utter.
This is where Bill got killed, huh?
Uh...
I'll be sorry about that for as long as I live.
Can you tell me about it?
Yeah.
It
- It was about sun-Up
Over at that Bella Union joint,
Mr. Hickok plum gutted McCall at draw.
And now here Mr. Hickok was at poker again.
Say a couple hours of daylight left
And in come that coward McCall.
Walked up on him and shot him in the head.
Bill never know when he come in.
Uh, those of us that did,
We didn't have no inkling of what he intended.
He just murdered him, right where he sat.
Man:
if I may, sir...
This is here where
Wild Bill was sitting when McCall entered from the front,
Approached the table, causing no apprehension
'Cause he had often frequented the game.
Of a sudden, McCall produced a revolver
And shouting "take that, damn you!" He fired.
Muzzle couldn't have been three inches from Wild Bill's head.
Now I'm told that hick fell dead immediately,
But I won't testify to it,
Because the bullet, after it passed through Wild Bill's brain,
Struck me in my right wrist,
And I lost several seconds to pain before regaining my senses.
Sir, you have my word as eyewitness to the rest,
And I suppose this wound as added proof for the doctors
They feared crippled me in the hand I use to write.
I will take the murderer's bullet to my grave.
Thanks.
Aces over eights,
As I just now recall.
That is the hand that Wild Bill had.
Sure, captain.
Sure.
You like how that falls?
Sure.
- Do you like it, flora?
- Why not?
I'd prefer you happy, honey, but if you can't be,
You need to pretend at it better than you're doing
Or you're gonna be hungry and cold
And getting done to you for nothing outside
What you'd have made money to live on and save up besides
If you acted the part in here.
I thought I only had to act it with them that wanna stick it in me.
You never know who that might be, flora.
There you go.
I prefer you happy.
Or at least pretending better?
I think he's dead, doc.
Could you tell the litter bearers not to make so much of getting this one outta here?
- Has young Joey gone to dust?
- Yeah.
As flesh must,
To be restored by the savior's return.
Oh, Mr. Bullock is back among us,
And also, also Mr. Utter.
Does Charlie know about Bill?
They were together, Mr. Bullock and he.
They'd captured Jack McCall.
I hope that's only the beginning of what they fucking did to him.
- Gave him over to the federal authorities.
- Gave him over?
- Rendered unto caesar.
- Jesus Christ.
Mr.
- Mr. Bullock was struck by an indian's axe.
Marked like the first-Born of Adam and Eve.
- Are you drunk?
- No.
- What the fuck is that?
- He's all right.
All right, reverend.
All right, reverend.
All right.
You're all right, reverend.
All right.
He marks us sinful
And forgiven by confession.
All right.
He has told us and shown us.
He has told me.
All right.
You listen to me now, reverend.
You are goddamn exhausted,
And you give yourself no respite.
These seizures may owe something to that,
But it also wouldn't surprise me
If you had a lesion in your goddamn head,
And that's what's giving you the seizures
And generating your chats with the goddamn divinity.
No goddamn offense intended.
- None taken, sir.
- Now get outta here,
- And get yourself some rest!
- Jane: go on, reverend.
Doc's tired too,
The only reason he's talking so fucking harsh.
Could not the lesion be
The instrument of god's instructive intention, doctor,
If I am so afflicted?
Well, of course it could,
His ways not being ours and so forth.
But could he not, reverend, just want you
Getting out of here and getting yourself some goddamn rest?
- Flora: you have to go now.
- We don't have to do nothing,
I'd pay the same price just to sit with you.
My brother works in this place up here, and he keeps a hard watch.
If you wanna stick it in me tomorrow,
You better let me go in by myself.
- What time are you gonna start?
- 11:00, I guess.
I'll be receiving around noon.
All right, flora.
Here's a dollar anyway.
You're swell.
Evening.
Evening, miss.
- You're early.
- Yes.
- I guess no luck finding your dad.
- No, no luck.
I knew you would've had a cheerier look on your face if you had.
Let me get you a place to sit away from these rough sons of bitches.
Hey!
Do your drinking at the bar or get the fuck out of here!
You have a seat here.
I'll get you a beverage.
Do you want a soft cider or a sarsaparilla?
- Cider if it's not a trouble.
- Soft cider.
Did she find her dad?
Her chances of finding her dad are greater than yours
Of walking out of this door upright,
Unless you shut your fucking mouth.
You got it?
Swearengen's had his hand on the tiller
Far as getting dealing with this epidemic.
- Is that so?
- Yeah, the dead don't drink or chase women
Must be his thinking on that subject.
That Indian fought like hell.
I'd guess you did too.
Charlie figured out how it must have been.
The Indian had to kill me for coming on the burial place,
And maybe it had been me, too, that killed his friend,
Cut his friend's head off so he wouldn't have eyes to see the sunset
All those years he'd be lying there dead.
So he had to kill me for that too.
And he couldn't before he'd laid hands on me
Or the killing wouldn't be honorable.
We fought like fucking hell, I'll tell you that much,
And I never once had the upper-Hand.
It just happened out the way it happened out.
He was just trying to live, same as me,
And do honor to his friend, and make some fucking sense out of things.
And we wind up that way, and I wind up
After beating him till I couldn't recognize his face.
For Christ's sake!
That Indian saved Jack McCall's life,
- I'll tell you that fucking much.
- Not for long.
Brian MacDonald's not coming.
I want his recommendation
Who should assay that widow's claim.
- Whose?
- Swearengen's.
Shit, Seth.
Get his opinion, too, who should guard that henhouse we're gonna build.
So... are you okay?
- Yes, and you?
- Yes.
They're nice here.
And Mr. Swearengen, he's funny as all get-Out.
So what place would make a better score?
Where I'm working.
But why not take 'em both?
- Could we have a private talk?
- Sure we can.
- Should I be armed?
- Where do you wanna talk?
Come here.
What do you think of that?
I think that son of a bitch better stop looking evil at that little girl.
- So was it McCall who improved your appearance?
- No.
Whoever got the job done, I hope you gave as good as you got.
It's good to have you back, with me being superstitious
And all hell breaking loose when you left.
I'm here to talk about Mrs. Garret.
They planted her husband this morning?
I wrote a man about coming to assay her claim,
- But he can't make it.
- Plenty of local alternatives.
I want you to nominate someone.
Do you?
So if any way his work was mistaken,
I'd be coming after you.
- You would?
- Yeah.
Since I got nothing to do with the venture,
What if I decline to make the recommendation?
Then you better hope whoever I find does his job right,
'Cause I'm still holding you accountable.
I ain't involved.
E.B. Farnum offered on her claim.
Farnum's your water-Boy and I know what you've been trying to do to her.
So here you come in all nobility...
Threatening me with a dire result
If the property of that widow's husband
Thought worthless from when it sold,
Turns out not to be pinched out.
You and I know how it is, Mr. Swearengen.
- How what is?
- She gets a square shake,
Or I come for you.
What if I come for you?
Are you ready for that?
I guess I'd better be.
Then close your fucking store, 'cause being ready for me
Will take care of your waking hours
And you better have someone to hand the task off to when you close your eyes.
We understand each other.
Man:
Al!
Al!
Jesus fucking Christ!
Walk right past me, your holiness,
So I can shut my fucking office.
Al!
Dan:
go on!
Stare at her now!
Huh?
You like fucking little girls?
Take a look at that little girl
'Cause she's the last thing you're ever gonna see.
- Stare at her now, cocksucker.
- Al:
let him down!
Let him fucking down!
Or should I have had him hold him up?
You head what I said about the widow.
Oh yes, your holiness.
You heard me too.
So I take it this was a fair fucking fight, yeah?
Men:
yeah!
That's right!
Two free drinks for everybody.
And drinks all night for them that help with the disposal.
Man #2:
that's me!
I'm sorry that you had to see that.
Shut the fuck up, Dan, and get her the fuck away from here
- Now!
Come on.
I'm sorry, Mr. Swearengen.
I warned him not to look at her.
I warned him.
Fucking pussy.
Jane: that Joey passed this afternoon.
Been suffering awful.
But that frog-Looking fellow left the tent
That I found up in the woods,
Left the tent fucking cure pronounced by the doc himself.
And in the dumbest looking outfit a grown man ever wore.
Who's there, god damn it?
!
Who the hell's it look like?
How the fuck do I know who it fucking looks like?
It's dark!
Jesus Christ, come upon a person unawares in a fucking graveyard!
I heard you was back in the camp.
I heard you and that Bullock got the cocksucker did for Bill.
Was Bill dead by the time you saw him?
Yeah, he was already dead.
Why did he let that son of a bitch get to him?
I don't know, Charlie.
Anyways, people don't scare me past speaking,
I come up here nights tell him the fucking news.
Go ahead.
Charlie avenged your fucking murder.
And that Bullock fella was with me that you seemed to like.
Although it occurred to me to wonder why they didn't do for the cocksucker
- Right on the fucking spot.
- Is that something we need to get into in front of him?
You got the biggest mouth in the territory.
You talk to him.
Tell him whatever you want.
I got that mail route in Cheyenne that we talked about.
I was bringing back supplies to them hardware boys
And I run into that Bullock fella.
He was out there looking for that McCall
That
- That killed you.
And he run into some heathen boy
And he had one hell of a fight.
Boy, and he just- He got-
He got f-
Fuck.
Can I-
Can I tell him some more tomorrow?
Sure, what the fuck you asking me for?
I don't make the rules.
Wanna go back to the camp?
Please.
And what must Mr. Bullock have been thinking
As I inflicted my personal confidences upon him?
- I don't know.
- Nor do I.
At least he kept a decent privacy.
I have to go back to the gem.
He's waiting for me now to tell him
Yours and Mr. Bullock's thinking about selling the claim,
And I won't be able to lie anymore.
Next I tell will be my last.
So I better just get back there.
Mr. Swearengen discovered our deception?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Looking at you walk out of the fucking hotel.
- He did not.
I was careful to see he wasn't watching in the window.
It don't matter, Mrs. Garret.
The point is, I gotta go back.
And you need someone to look to this child,
And with choices bigger elsewhere
And nothing I can tell to hold you here,
Maybe you better think about selling and getting out.
Would you wanna take the girl and go?
Where?
- I have no people anywhere.
- You could go to New York.
I
- I could have my relatives there see you established.
What the fuck?
What would keep you here?
You wanna fuck this man?
Fuck him, then think about the child-
Don't use that language with me, Trixie, or that tone-
Don't you wanna say to remember my place?
I do, you rich cunt.
And I'm going back to it.
She's about to say her name, you know.
She named her sisters and her folks.
Think of selling.
If you took her away, you could hear her say it.
* old friend * all the stories to tell * * old friend
* could you bid me farewell?
* * ooh, old friend * it might be easy for another man to see *
* old fool * all the pain and the scars * * old fool
* could you lay down your arms?
* * old fool * it might be easy for another man to see *
* but I think you still look a lot like me. *

Al:
A SLOB MICK COP IN CHICAGO

JUST BECAUSE HE THINKS HE CAN.
'CAUSE WHEN HE COMES AROUND FOR HIS FREE FUCKIN' MEAL
AND TO HAVE HIS PRICK SUCKED AND COLLECT HIS WEEKLY 20 FUCKIN' DOLLARS

BULLOCK'S RODE OUT WITH THAT HOSTETLER FROM THE LIVERY.
FARNUM'S SLITHERED HIS WAY ACROSS HERE.
JEWEL JUST LEFT.

- BUT NOW COME BACK TO BED.
( mocking )
( laughing )
WHO'S SICK?
WHAT'S HE DOIN' MAKING YOU WALK TO TELL ME?
I CAME HERE ON MY OWN, DOC.
I GOT SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU.
IT'S A BOOK.
OH NO, I DON'T READ GODDAMN BOOKS ON THE CIVIL WAR.
- LOOK!
- I DON'T NEED TO LOOK.
I WAS GODDAMN THERE.
BUT IT'LL HELP ME WALK BETTER.
OKAY, YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE BRACE ON HIS LEG.
YES.
FOR YOUR INFORMATION, JEWEL,
THAT BOY IN THE DRAWING WAS GODDAMN ABLE-BODIED
BEFORE HE GOT HIS LEG SHOT UP,
NOT BORN WITH DIFFICULTIES AND HARDSHIPS
THAT GOT NO CURE AND TOOK FROM YOU
THE COORDINATION A BRACE LIKE THAT WOULD REQUIRE.
I WAS JUST LOOKIN' AT THE PICTURE,
AND DRAGGIN' MY LEG REALLY MAKES AL CRAZY.
FUCK AL.
EVERYBODY'S GOT LIMITS.
YOU DRAGGIN' YOUR LEG IS YOURS.
- I'M SORRY.
- WHAT DO YOU APOLOGIZE FOR?
DON'T-
- DON'T APOLOGIZE TO ME.
LEMME--
LET ME HOLD ONTO THIS FOR A WHILE.
THANK YOU.
( A.W. laughs ) MOMENTOUS!

OH, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES!
OH GOD, OH GOD, OH, YES, YES.

AH, JOSEPH,
WHAT YOU SEE HERE
IS AN AMERICAN OPTICAL BACK-FOCUS SINGLE-SWING
WITH A MEYER GORLITZ TRIOPLAN 210MM LENS.
THE FINEST PHOTOGRAPHIC APPARATUS MANUFACTURED IN THIS COUNTRY.
WHAT WILLIAM HENRY FOX TALBOT COULD HAVE ACHIEVED
IN SERVICE OF THIS FINE APPARATUS.
OH, GOD!
AGH!
OH, GOD, YES, CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
- GOOD DAY, SIR.
- OW.DAMN.
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- I BIT MY D--
OH.
( laughs ) SORRY.
LEANED FORWARD TO GIVE THAT FELLA PASSAGE
AND BIT MY DAMN TONGUE.
KNOCKED OFF MY CHEWIN' ANGLE.
- IS IT BLEEDING?
- I DON'T WANT TO LOOK.
MIGHT UPSET THE CHILD.
ANYWAYS, MAYBE A DIFFERENT WAY'S OPENED UP, CHARLIE,
AS FAR AS ME GETTING BACKING FOR MY BROTHEL.
AHA.
I UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION WAS LOCATION,
BUT GLAD TO HEAR THE BACKIN' PROBLEM'S SOLVED.
I THINK, UH, I'VE BEEN FINICKY OVER THE LOCATION
'CAUSE I WASN'T COMFORTABLE WITH THE BACKING.
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING--
I AIN'T MAKING TOO MANY FRIENDS IN THIS CAMP
IN MY CAPACITY AS FIRE MARSHAL.
WE'RE THROUGH THE EASY PICKING'S ON THAT OUTCROP, MA'AM.
I'LL WADE AROUND THAT CREEK AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.
YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR CLAIM SHOW ITS COLORS,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO SINK A FEW SHAFTS.
I'M CLOSE TO SUGGESTING THAT WE PROCEED.
MEANING MY USE TO YOU IS NEAR A FINISH.
NO!
I TOLD YOU, MRS. GARRET, SUCH AS IT IS,
MY EXPERTISE AIN'T UNDERGROUND.
I WANT YOU STILL TO SUPERVISE.
I TRUST YOU, ELLSWORTH, AS AN HONORABLE MAN.
I TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN YOUR COMPANY.
I FEEL THE SAME.
I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR BREAKFASTS,
AND I'LL JUST SAY ONCE,
I KNOW I'M TOO DAMN OLD FOR YA.
BUTTON!
OH MY GOODNESS.
I CAN'T BE...
I TAKE A FATHER'S LIBERTY.
MR. ELLSWORTH, MR. RUSSELL.
- HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?
- HOW DO YOU DO?
UH, AND THIS IS SOPHIA.
- HELLO, SOPHIA.
- HELLO.
YOUR DAUGHTER?
MY WARD.
ANY RATE, PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, SIR.
I'M HONORED TO BE IN YOUR DAUGHTER'S EMPLOY.
AND WITH YOUR PERMISSION, MA'AM, I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE.
UH, OF COURSE.
AND MY PLATE...

AND MY HAT.
FINE MANNERS.
( chuckles )
REVEREND SMITH.
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
ANDY CRAMED, REVEREND.
MR. CRAMED, YOU RETURNED TO THE SETTING OF YOUR RECOVERY.
UH-HUH.
HOW HAVE YOU FARED SINCE?
I'VE BEEN TRYING OUT THE OTHER CAMPS.
TO WHAT EFFECT?
NO GOOD EFFECT, REVEREND.
I SEE.
HOW YOU FEELING?
AS YOU SEE.
THE-
- THE TENT, AS YOU SEE,
IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING DISMANTLED.
OUR LAST TENANT TOOK HIS LEAVE YESTERDAY.
- UPRIGHT?
- HE WAS UPRIGHT, YES.
HIS NAME ESCAPES ME.
DR. COCHRAN, I BELIEVE, UH,
IS EXPECTED SHORTLY, I BELIEVE.
I WAS ASKED TO--
TO SEE TO THE PACKING OF...
CERTAIN LINIMENTS AND...
MEDICINES.
( heavy breathing )
ARE YOU NOT WELL, MINISTER?
SOMETIMES I'M VERY WELL, INDEED.
MY ENERGY WILL RETURN,
OR EVEN AN EXCESS OF ENERGY.
AT OTHER TIMES, I'M NOT WELL,
OR EXCESS OF ENERGY.
HOW ARE YOU, MR. CRAMED?
WELL, I BACKSLID IN THE OTHER CAMPS.
AT GAYVILLE, I HAD THE BEST INTENTIONS,
- AND I WOUND UP AT DICE.
- OH, YES.
AT ELIZABETHTOWN,
I WOUND UP AT DICE--
OH, YES.
THOUGHT I'D TRY TO WORK HERE WHERE I'D BEEN GOOD,
BUT YOU'RE PUTTING THE TENT DOWN.
ASK GOD'S HELP, MR. CRAMED.
WHEREVER YOU FIND YOURSELF, HE WILL SHOW YOU THE PATH.
COULD YOU HELP ME TO PRAY?
LORD,
GRANT THAT I MAY SEEK RATHER TO COMFORT
THAN TO BE COMFORTED,
TO UNDERSTAND THAN TO BE UNDERSTOOD...
TO LOVE THAN TO BE LOVED...
AND THE REST I FORGET.
"WHY DON'T YOU GET A HAIRCUT, ADAMS?
LOOKS LIKE YOUR MAMA FUCKED A MONKEY."
JUST THAT AFFECTIONATE?
YEAH, I'VE NEVER SEEN AL WARM UP TO ANYBODY SO QUICK.
WHICH SHOULD PERSUADE YOU THEN OF WHAT?
WELL, YOU THINK IT'S JUST TACTICS?
THE MAGISTRATE AL COUNTED ON
TO BE HIS ADVOCATE IN YANKTON TURNED JUDAS.
ADAMS IS THE MAGISTRATE'S BAGMAN.
AL IS MERELY PROBING ADAMS' WILLINGNESS
TO BETRAY THE MAGISTRATE.
IN TURN, HIS WARMTH IS COUNTERFEIT.
- Al:
WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU?
- AT THE DOC.
FIX ME A CUP OF COFFEE.
MORNING.
SHORN AND GROOMED TO A FUCKING FARE-THEE-WELL.
SHE'D NEVER RECOGNIZE YOU--
HAVE TO SMELL YOU ALL OVER TO KNOW YOU WAS HERS.
MY MONKEY MOTHER.
TAKE A TABLE OUT OF THE TRAFFIC, HUH?
JUST THAT AFFECTIONATE.
I TRUST YOU FOUND YOUR ACCOMMODATIONS SATISFACTORY,
MR. ADAMS-- SILAS.
IF NOT, THEY COULD ALWAYS BE CHANGED.
LET ME FUCKING POUR.
HE'S GOTTA MAKE SOME DISTANCE BEFORE SUNSET.
WHAT WAS YOUR PURPOSE AT DOC'S?
I'M KNOCKED UP.
WHAT MESSAGE SHOULD I TAKE TO THE MAGISTRATE?
NO ENVELOPES AND TO FUCK HIMSELF.
I'M GLAD WE HAD OCCASION LAST NIGHT
TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER,
SO WHEN HE ASKS IF THIS IS TACTICS OR TRUE POSITION,
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
- I'LL KNOW.
- YOU TRAVEL SAFE.
THEY BELIEVE YOU'RE THE MAN TO DEAL WITH--
YANKTON.
- I AM.
- IT'S JUST THE MAGISTRATE
LOOKING TO EARN OFF THAT WARRANT.
AND NO ONE ELSE EVEN KNOWS IT'S OUT ON YOU.
MAYBE THE MAGISTRATE NEEDS TO DIE.
MAYBE HE DOES.
HE WON'T COME BACK HERE WITHOUT A RESOLUTION.
HE'LL KNOW WHAT'S WAITING FOR HIM.
MAYBE HE NEEDS TO DIE THERE.
MAYBE HE SHOULD.
AND THE PERSON WHO DID IT
WOULD ONLY BE AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS USEFULNESS TO ME.
IF THAT PERSON DIDN'T COME BACK WITH THE WARRANT ON YOU QUASHED,
HE WOULD BE A FOOL NOT TO THINK HE'D BE THE NEXT ONE KILLED.
THAT'S WHY HE'D BE SO USEFUL TO ME THINKING THAT FAR AHEAD.
MAKE YOUR OFFER.
A THOUSAND FOR THE COCKSUCKER PROVED DEAD,
A THOUSAND FOR THE WARRANT PROVED LIFTED.
A THOUSAND AND A THOUSAND.
- THINK I AM A FUCKING MONKEY?
- YOU THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE 20 IN IT?
KILL CLAGETT AND GET YOU OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THAT WARRANT?
YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT THERE'S 20.
DO IT FOR TWO.
YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE
THE JOB WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO YOUR FUTURE,
AND YOU GOTTA BELIEVE YOU'D MAKE YOUR ASS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN HERE AND YANKTON.
2,000.
I PUT HIM IN A ROOM ABOVE THE PRIVY.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA END LIKE THIS, BUTTON.
A ROOMING HOUSE
IN A MINING CAMP ON INDIAN TERRITORY,
YOU CARING FOR A NORWEGIAN FOUNDLING
AND OPERATING A BONANZA GOLD CLAIM.
( chuckles )
AND YOU, DADDY?
UH, ALWAYS A LITTLE SKETCHY ABOUT ME.
I HOPE I'M HERE TO HELP.
( knock on door )
OH, THAT WOULD BE MY ROOM KEY.
SOPHIA?
- ROOM SEVEN.
- THANK YOU, SIR.
- Sophia:
THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME, LITTLE ONE.
OH MY GOODNESS, WHAT'S THAT BEHIND YOUR EAR?
DON'T YOU EVER CLEAN BEHIND YOUR EAR?
MMM.
DOES CARING FOR SOPHIA PLEASE YOU?
MORE WITH EACH DAY.
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THE GOLD?
AS IT HAPPENS...
THE WELL-MANNERED MR. ELLSWORTH SAYS THESE ABOUND?
YES.
THERE'S SOME TALK THAT YOU DID BROM IN.
FROM HIS PARENTS?
THEY HAVE RAISED THE POSSIBILITY.
AS IT HAPPENS, I WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN BROM FELL.
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, IT'S A SUSPICIOUS SEQUENCE--
- THE MAN WHO WAS IS IN CAMP.
- --GIVEN THEIR VIEW OF THE MARRIAGE.
I DOUBT HE TELLS THE TRUE STORY OF HOW BROM DIED,
BUT HE WOULD VERIFY THAT I WASN'T THERE.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU.
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY, BUTTON.
IN CERTAIN CIRCLES.
BUT NOT HERE, HMM?
I SUPPOSE HERE, AS WELL.
IN CERTAIN CIRCLES.
MR. ELLSWORTH BEING THE EXCEPTION?
MR. ELLSWORTH WAS ENGAGED BY A MR. SETH BULLOCK,
WHO'S BEEN STEADFAST AND KIND.
AND WHEN DID YOUR PATH CROSS MR. BULLOCK'S?
BEFORE BROM'S ACCIDENT OR AFTER?
MR. BULLOCK WAS ASKED TO LOOK TO MY INTERESTS
BY WILD BILL HICKOK.
WHO, IF I RECALL YOUR READING HABITS,
HAS BEEN AN ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS SINCE CHILDHOOD.
( chuckles )
I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO MEET THIS MR. BULLOCK...
NEARLY AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO WASH.
DADDY.
AH.
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.
Charlie:
STOVEPIPE DIRECTLY INTO WOOD,
NO CLEARANCE OR SHEET IRON IN-BETWEEN.
WELL, WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE?
JOINT'S LIKE TO BURN TO CINDERS.
WELL, THEN WHY AIN'T IT YET?
DUMB LUCK, TOM.
WHICH YOU HADN'T OUGHT TO PUSH,
CAMP BEING SITUATED LIKE IT IS,
EVERYONE ASS TO ELBOW.
A HAZARD TO ONE IS A HAZARD TO ALL.
WHY, AIN'T YOU STARTING TO TALK
LIKE A GODDAMN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL?
I'M CHARLIE UTTER
THAT ATTENDED THE SAME FUCKING MEETING YOU DID.
AND BEING THEY PINNED FIRE MARSHAL ON ME,
I AIN'T SEEING THE CAMP BURNED TO THE GROUND.
SO EITHER CURE YOUR STOVEPIPE VIOLATION
OR PREPARE TO GET LEVIED A FINE.
WELL, I'LL LICK A BEAR'S ASS
BEFORE I'D PAY A FINE TO E.B. FARNUM.
THEN SEPARATE YOUR GODDAMN STOVEPIPES
FROM THE GODDAMN WALL!
WELL, I'LL SEND ONE OF MY BOYS OVER TO PICK UP THE IRON.
THIS AIN'T THE GODDAMN DAY OF JUDGMENT, TOM.
JESUS CHRIST ALMIGHTY!
THAT'S THE KIND OF SHIT THAT RAN ME OUT OF WILKES-BARRE.
WHERE ARE THE CAMP'S HEADED, TOM?
MAYBE I'LL JUST FUCKING MOVE ALONG.
WHY IS THERE NO SHERIFF IN THIS CAMP?
WHAT?
ALL THESE OFFICIAL POSITIONS,
WHY IS THERE NO SHERIFF?
BECAUSE AL SWEARENGEN DON'T WANT ONE.
WELL, WHAT IF A SHERIFF TOOK OFFICE
THAT AL COULD TRUST NOT TO BOTHER HIM?
AND YOU COULD LAY HEAD TO PILLOW NIGHTS KNOWING HE WAS YOUR FRIEND.
TYPE OF MAN WHO'D GO UP TO A FIRE MARSHAL, SAY,
AND TELL HIM ANY SO-CALLED SHEET IRON VIOLATION
THAT HADN'T PROVEN TO BE DANGEROUS FOR, WHAT--
GOING ON TWO MONTHS NOW-- SHOULD BE WAIVED;
AND WHOSE EAR'D BE FIRST TO THE GROUND
WHEN ANY VIOLENCE CREATED MAYBE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES;
AND WHO'D REMEMBER WHO GOT HIM SITUATED.
I NEVER THOUGHT OF YOU AS THE TYPE TO BE SHERIFF.
NAH, I'D BE OUT OF THE MOLD,
BUT FIT FOR THE CAMP.
MY PROBLEM, TOM, IS, UH...
WHEREAS HE HAS A SOFT SPOT FOR YOU
AS A FELLOW PIONEER,
SWEARENGEN HATES MY FUCKING GUTS.
SO KNOWING HOW GRATEFUL I'D BE AND ALLS I'D...
SHOW IT TO YOU, WONDER IF YOU'D PUT IN A WORD?
-( knocks on door )
- YEAH?
MR. TOLLIVER?
LEON.
COME ON IN.
YOUR HABIT GET THE BEST OF YOU AWHILE, SON?
IT GOT THE FUCKING UPPER HAND.
HOW'S YOUR SIGHT, LEON?
OH, THE LEFT EYE'S PERFECT, AND THE RIGHT'S COMING BACK.
- HAVE I STILL GOT A JOB, SIR?
- I'D NEED TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU,
WHAT YOU BEEN UP TO, WHO THE FUCK WITH.
THAT KIND OF THING.
AW, YOU PROBABLY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING ALREADY.
BE THAT AS IT MAY...
AHEM, WELL...
ME AND JIMMY IRONS, WE STOLE THE CHINAMAN'S DOPE.
CHINAMAN'S COURIER, HE LOST HIS LIFE.
WE SLAMMED DOPE FOR A SERIES OF DAYS,
AND AL SWEARENGEN'S TOUGH CAPTURED US.
AND IN THE BATHHOUSE, WE DREW STRAWS AND...
JIMMY IRONS DROWNED.
DOES THAT ABOUT COVER IT?
IF YOU ASK ME SPECIFICS,
I MAY BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOME MORE DETAILS.
- WAS AL SWEARENGEN HOLDING THE STRAWS, LEON?
- YES, SIR.
HE SAID TO TELL YOU WHAT I SEEN.
AND NOW IS HE HOLDING THE STRINGS ON YOU?
- SIR?
- ARE YOU HERE ON HIS INSTRUCTION?
I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I SEEN BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME TO.
WHAT'D THEY DO WITH JIMMY IRONS?
THEY GIVE HIM TO THE CHINAMAN?
I GUESS THEY DID.
THEY WRAPPED HIM UP AND TOOK HIM OUT.
SWEARENGEN TURNED ME LOOSE,
BUT HE'D JUST GIVE ME THIS,
SO I STAYED IN THE TUB UNTIL I GOT MY BEARINGS.
THAT'S A HELL OF A WAY TO TREAT A WHITE MAN, AIN'T IT, LEON?
BEING FAIR, I'D HAVE TO SAY,
I GAVE MR. SWEARENGEN PROVOCATION.
HE TRAFFICS IN DOPE, SO I--
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT I'D STOLE HIS PROPERTY AND FUCKED HIS ACTION UP.
I'M TALKING ABOUT JIMMY IRONS
IN CONNECTION WITH GETTING DELIVERED TO A CHINK,
- REGARDLESS OF HIS TRANSGRESSION.
- OH, I SEE.
AND IN THAT CONNECTION, I'M SAYING
IT'S A HELL OF A WAY TO TREAT A WHITE MAN.
I SEE.
- DO YOU AGREE WITH ME?
- YES.
- SO IT'S YOUR OWN OPINION, TOO?
- YES, SIR.
WELL, THAT'S YOUR NEW FUCKING JOB,
EXPRESSING YOUR OWN FUCKING OPINION.
I CAN DO THAT.
WITH CONVICTION, LEON.
YOUR JOB IS TO VOICE YOUR OPINION WITH SOME "OOMPH"
AND SOME CHARACTER BEHIND IT...
OR YOU'LL WISH YOU'D HAVE GOT DROWNED IN THAT BATHHOUSE.
ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME BACK, SON.
OH...
NO THANKS, AL.
I-
- OR...
YES, I WILL.
WHAT'S GOING ON, TOM?
I-I-
- I THOUGHT YOU COULD MAKE CON STAPLETON...
SHERIFF,
BEING IT'S INEVITABLE ANYWAY.
HOW THE FUCK DID THAT GET TO BE INEVITABLE?
I WOULDN'T APPOINT THAT COCKSUCKER TO EMPTY MY SPITTOONS.
WHAT I'M SAYING IS SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE SHERIFF, AL.
STAPLETON'S GOT POINTS IN HIS FAVOR.
I HOPE ONE'S NOT GETTING TO RECOVER THE BRIBE HE PAID YOU
WHEN I DON'T GIVE HIM THE FUCKING JOB.
- WHO'S YOUR CANDIDATE, AL?
- NOBODY.
WELL, THAT'S JUST POSTPONING THE INEVITABLE.
TOM, NOTHING STAPLETON'S GOT ON YOU
CAN'T BE SOLVED BY DAN DORITY.
WELL...
FILL ME UP.
JESUS CHRIST.
THE-
- THE TRUTH IS I-I FEEL LIKE THE--
THE CAMP'S GETTING AWAY FROM ME, AL.
I GOT A FIRE COMMISSIONER
WHO'S ABOUT TO CONDEMN MY BUILDING,
AND WE'RE STILL ON INDIAN LAND.
HOW DOES STAPLETON BECOMING SHERIFF
KEEP THE CAMP FROM GETTING AWAY FROM YOU?
WELL, I KNOW HIM.
UH, HE'D KNOW I PUT IN A WORD WITH YOU.
WHAT THE FUCK GOOD IS THAT TO YOU, TOM,
WHEN THAT COCKSUCKER CAN BE BOUGHT
FOR TWO PIECES OF DAY OLD BREAD?
WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT-
- THAT ALL MAKES SENSE.
IT, UH...
EH, WHEN YOU FIRST COME TO THIS CAMP
AND HUNG YOUR SIGN UP FOR NICKEL BOOZE AND 50¢ PUSSY--
( chuckles ) THEM WAS GET-ACQUAINTED PRICES.
BUT THE POINT IS, I SEEN YOUR FUCKING TENT.
I WALKED OVER AND I-- I SAID "HELLO!"
I DIDN'T TELL YOU-- YOU GOTTA SHEET IRON
YOUR FUCKING STOVEPIPE.
I DIDN'T HAVE A STOVEPIPE,
AND YOU HAD YOUR KNIFE AT THE READY
IF I DIDN'T MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION.
THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH, BUT YOU DIDN'T.
AND DORITY MADE A HELL OF A ONE ON YOU.
THAT TOO, IS-
- IS TRUE ENOUGH.
NOW, I JUST, UH...
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW THE GUY, AL.
STAPLETON.
WELL...
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE I KNOW ANYBODY NO MORE.
HE CAN BE SHERIFF FOR ALL I CARE.
THANK YOU, AL.
DON'T COUNT ON HIM TO BE LOYAL, TOM.
NO, NO...
JUST...
A FAMILIAR FACE.
AND NO FUCKING PAPERWORK.
WELL, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE CAN WRITE.
- COULD HE BE SWORN IN HERE, AL?
- FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, TOM!
- HE FEELS YOU DON'T LIKE HIM.
- HE'S FUCKING RIGHT AS RAIN.
BUT IT'D BE A COMFORT TO HIM, SEE,
IF HE WAS SWORN IN UNDER YOUR ROOF.
LET FARNUM SWEAR HIM THE FUCK IN HERE THEN.
BUT PRESS YOUR LUCK NO FURTHER.
DO NOT EXPECT ME TO FUCKING ATTEND.
AWFUL GRATEFUL, AL.
- MR. STAR.
- MISS TRIXIE, PLEASED TO SEE YOU.
I THREATENED TO PAY A VISIT.
YOU SPOKE OF LOOKING OUT FOR SOME BUILDING IMPLEMENTS.
I SPOKE OF LOOKING OUT FOR AN AX AND A SAW,
AND IF I GOT 'EM, THEY WOULDN'T BE APPLIED TO BUILDING NOTHING.
ANYWAYS...
WOULD YOU WANT A FREE FUCK?
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
- TO KNOW THE ANSWER.
WHY WOULD YOU SAY IT THAT WAY?
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.
MR. STAR,
MY CHERRY IS OBSTRUCTING MY WORK.
SIR...
WOULD YOU TAKE IT FROM ME, FREE?
( door opening )
SETH, YOU REMEMBER TRIXIE.
OH, YES.
WELL, I JUST STOPPED FOR A MOMENT.
OH, YES.
- I'LL LOCK UP.
- OH, YES.
KISS MY NECK OR TITS IF YOU HAVE TO KISS SOMETHING.
LET ME KISS YOU.
WELL, YOU'RE A GODDAMN JEW FOOL.
E.B.:
DO YOU SWEAR BEFORE THIS WITNESS
TO UPHOLD WHATEVER LAWS MAY BE PUT IN FORCE SUBSEQUENTLY?
YEAH, IF I CAN, YEAH.
- AND DON'T FORGET WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE.
- ALWAYS.
GENTLEMEN, HOLD STILL.
TAKE A BREATH.
DON'T MOVE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.
VERY GOOD.
UH, GENTLEMEN, TOM, I--
I WONDERED IF A SECOND ONE MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE
WITHOUT THAT PUTRID APRON AROUND YOUR MIDSECTION.
- NO.
LET'S DRINK.
- ( laughs )
OUR HEALTH COMMISSIONER.
WHISKEY.
YOU'VE JUST MISSED MY SWEARING IN OF THE CAMP'S NEW SHERIFF.
CON STAPLETON, SIR.
I'M NOT SURE IF WE'VE ACTUALLY MET.
YOU WERE AT THE TABLE WHEN HICKOK WAS KILLED.
INDEED, I WAS.
A HORRIFIED BYSTANDER.
WE WEREN'T TO HAVE A SHERIFF.
WELL, THAT'S BEEN RECONSIDERED AS INEVITABLE.
HAD YOU DESIGNS ON THE POST, BULLOCK?
- I DON'T WANT THE POST.
- NO HARD FEELINGS THEN.
CONSIDER ME AT YOUR SERVICE.
MY WIFE AND CHILD ARE TO JOIN ME FROM MICHIGAN.
- IS AL IN HIS OFFICE?
- E.B.:
SEEMS TO BE SEQUESTERED.
HE MISSED THE SWEARING IN TOO.
HE DID WANT US OVER HERE, THOUGH.
AIN'T THAT ABSOLUTELY CORRECT?
THEN WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T HE COME DOWN?
WHY DIDN'T HE COME DOWN?
THAT'S UNCLEAR.
TO LET YOU KNOW EXACTLY, I WOULD GUESS,
AT WHOSE MYSTERIOUS PLEASURE YOU SERVE.
A CANDID MOMENT.
CIRCUMCISION...
IS INDEED PROFITETH IF THOU KEEPEST THE LAW,
BUT IF, UH...
IF THOU ART A TRANSGRESSOR OF THE LAW,
THY CIRCUMCISION BECOMES UNCIRCUMCISION.
THEREFORE, IF...
THY...
UNCIRCUMCISION...
KEEPS THE, UH...
THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LAW,
SHALL NOT HIS UNCIRCUMCISION
BE COUNT FOR CIRCUMCISION?
YEA, THE UNCIRCUMCISION
THAT IS BY NATURE FULFILLING HIS LAW SHALL JUDGE THEE,
WHO BY-- BY LETTER AND UH...
CIRCUMCISION TRANSGRESSES THE LAW.
( knocking )
YEAH.
WHY'D YOU LET STAPLETON HAVE A BADGE?
THEY SWORN THE COCKSUCKER IN YET?
HURRY DOWN AND TOAST HIM.
MAYBE MERRICK'LL PUT HIS CAMERA BACK UP.
NO, I PREFER TO WATCH THE FUCKING REVEREND SMITH
PREACH TO THE OXEN AND HORSES.
IT AIN'T RIGHT FOR THE CAMP.
MY WIFE AND CHILD ARE COMING.
BULLOCK, IT'S A CEREMONIAL POSITION TO GIVE COMFORT
TO TOM NUTTALL WHO FEELS THE CAMP'S LEAVING HIM BEHIND.
PUTTING A BADGE ON STAPLETON MAKES HIM FEEL
HE'S GOT FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES.
THAT JOB SHOULDN'T GO TO A SHITHEEL.
AS MY FEELING WOULD BE, IT SHOULD GO TO A SHITHEEL 'CAUSE IT'S SHITHEEL'S WORK.
- DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.
- NO?
MR. BULLOCK, WOULD YOU SIT DOWN A SECOND?
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE LAW.
PLEASE, PLEASE, TAKE A SEAT.
SEPARATE FROM ALL THEM BRIBES WE PUT UP,
I PAID $5,000 TO AVOID BEING THE OBJECT
OF FIRESIDE DITTIES ABOUT A MAN THAT FLED A MURDER WARRANT
THEN WORKED VERY HARD TO GET HIS CAMP ANNEXED BY THE TERRITORY,
ONLY TO HAVE THEM SERVE THE WARRANT OF HIM
AND TO FACE THE SIX-FOOT DROP.
INTO THE COCKSUCKING MAGISTRATE'S POCKET
THE MONEY GOES, AFTER WHICH HE SENDS A MESSAGE.
THE 5,000 WILL NEED COMPANY IF I'M TO BE OFF THE HOOK.
I GIVE YOU THE LAW.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT.
NOW, IF YOU WERE FUCKING SHERIFF
AND YOU SAID, "DO THIS, DO THAT,"
I'D CONSIDER IT, 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT A FUCKING WHORE.
I HAVE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
I'D GO DOWNSTAIRS FOR THAT SWEARING IN, AND I'D FOLLOW YOUR CAREER,
'CAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PAINS IN THE BALLS WHO THINKS THE LAW CAN BE HONEST.
I DON'T WANT IT.
HELL, I DO LOTS OF THINGS I DON'T WANT TO DO.
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE?
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE WHEN TOM NUTTALL WAS PISSING IN MY EAR.
- ( door opens )
- I THINK YOU'D BE ALL RIGHT AS SHERIFF.
LISTEN, I'M ONLY TALKING TO YOU
'CAUSE MY PARTNER'S FUCKING THAT WHORE.
ANYWAY--
HE'S BACK OPEN.
- HOW WAS YOUR TALK WITH AL?
- CONGRATULATIONS.
GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP, BULLOCK.
Reverend:
WHO SHALL SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF CHRIST?
SHALL-
- SHALL AFFLICTION OR DISTRESS OR--
OR PERSECUTION OR--
OR HUNGER OR NAKEDNESS?
OR PERIL OR SWORD?
YEA, IN ALL THESE THINGS, WE MORE THAN CONQUER
THROUGH HIM THAT HATH LOVED US.
I AM PERSUADED THAT...
THAT NEITHER LIFE NOR DEATH,
NOR-
- NOR ANGELS,
NOR-
- NOR-- NOR PRINCIPALITIES,
NOR POWERS, NOR THINGS PRESENT OR THINGS TO COME,
NOR HEIGHTS, NOR DEPTHS,
NOR ANY OTHER CREATURE...
FROM THE LOVE OF-- OF GOD!
AND--
AND JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD.
- SETH.
- SOL.
SHE WASN'T HERE IN A PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY.
WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH SWEARENGEN
AS TO THE USE WE PUT THIS ESTABLISHMENT TO.
SHE COME LOOKING FOR GOODS AND THINGS TOOK A TURN.
- THAT CAN HAPPEN.
- NOT TWICE THOUGH, AT THIS LOCATION.
YEAH.
MAYBE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO SHOULD BE ABOUT LOOKING FOR A PLACE.
GONNA MAKE AN OFFER ON THAT PIECE ON THE WESTERN SLOPE.
DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER LOOK?
GO AHEAD AND GET TO BUILDING IF HOSTETLER TAKES THE OFFER.
MAYBE HAVE A LEG UP WHEN MARTHA AND YOUR BOY ARRIVE.
- GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR.
- GOOD AFTERNOON.
I AM OTIS RUSSELL.
UH, WOULD YOU BE MR. BULLOCK?
- I'M SOL STAR.
- OH, HOW DO YOU DO, MR. STAR?
- VERY WELL.
- I'M SETH BULLOCK.
MR. BULLOCK.
I AM ALMA GARRET'S FATHER.
- HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?
- HOW DO YOU DO?
I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE KINDNESS
THAT YOU'VE SHOWN MY DAUGHTER.
I WONDER IF YOU WOULD JOIN US FOR DINNER TONIGHT.
- I'D BE HAPPY TO.
- OH, MR. STAR, WILL YOU JOIN US?
- THANKS, BUT I CAN'T.
- REGRETTABLE.
WOULD 6:00 AT THE HOTEL BE CONVENIENT?
- MY DAUGHTER SAYS THAT THE DINNER HOUR IS EARLY.
- 6:00 IS FINE.
JUST MONTHS THAT THIS CAMP CAME TOGETHER, HUH?
- Sol:
YES, SIR.
- REMARKABLE.
HI, DOC.
FIRST THING TO SAY,
I REGRET THE TONE I HAD WITH YOU EARLIER.
OKAY.
IF WE HOLD WITH THE GREEKS THAT WE'RE MADE OF HUMORS,
I GUESS MY BILE WAS IN ITS ASCENDANT.
- ( chuckles ) OKAY.
- SIT DOWN.
ANOTHER THING...
THAT THE GREEKS SAY--
EXCEPT THAT I LEARNED THIS IN LATIN--
IS "PRIMUM NON NOCERE."
AND THAT MEANS, "FIRST, DO NO HARM."
AND THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT CONCERN TO ME IN YOUR CASE.
TO INTERFERE,
EVEN WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS,
AND HAVE YOU MISJUDGE YOUR CAPACITIES
'CAUSE YOU RELY ON SOME MECHANICAL CONTRAPTION
AND WIND UP HURTING YOURSELF,
WOULD BE A POOR USE,
INDEED, OF MY VERY LIMITED SKILLS.
YOU CAN GET AROUND NOW, JEWEL.
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WITH WHAT DIFFICULTY AND EXERTION AND PAIN,
BUT THE MOVING AROUND YOU CAN DO IS PRECIOUS TO YOU.
I DO NOT WANT TO FUCK YOU UP.
NO, WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT.
HAVING SAID THAT...
AND DIFFERENT FROM THE...
HARNESS-TYPE ATTACHMENTS
IN THAT CIVIL WAR BOOK,
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT TRY SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
LET'S.
HOW WAS YOUR VISIT, TRIXIE?
HOW WAS THE CHILD?
- HAD A GOOD VISIT.
- IS THE CHILD CONVERSANT?
MOVING ALONG FROM SAYING HER NAME?
ANYWAYS, I BETTER TAKE MY TURN.
NO, YOU LOOK GOOD HAVING GONE OUT.
YOU'RE MORE RELIEVED, MORE RELAXED.
WE CAN'T WORK ALL THE TIME, CAN WE?
WE ALL NEED SOME TYPE OF RELAXATION,
COMPANIONSHIP OR THE LIKE?
- YES.
- YOU GET AWAY FROM ME NOW.
HEY, DOC, HOW LONG WERE YOU PLANNING ON TAKING
BEFORE YOU TOLD ME WHAT THE FUCK WAS WRONG WITH JEWEL?
NOTHING, NOTHING SHE WASN'T BORN WITH.
MMM, I MEAN, SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS KNOCKED UP,
BUT I ASSUMED THAT WAS HER GIMP SENSE OF HUMOR.
SHE WANTS ME TO BRACE HER LEG
SO HER DRAGGING IT DOESN'T DRIVE YOU CRAZY.
- SO WHAT'D YOU TELL HER?
- NOT TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR MOODS,
THAT YOU GENERATE THOSE YOURSELF
AND THEN YOU FIND YOUR EXCUSE FOR HAVING 'EM.
SAUCY WORDS, DOC.
GOOD THING YOU'RE HANDY WITH THE SNATCH.
I HAD AN IDEA FOR A BOOT, JUST NOW MEASURED HER FOR IT.
IF YOU TREAT HER AS SUCCESSFULLY AS YOU DID THE MINISTER,
SHE'LL BE KICKING UP HER HEELS IN NO FUCKING TIME.
I WILL LEAVE YOU NOW TO PURSUE ANOTHER EXCUSE.
GET THAT JEW OVER HERE.
MY DAUGHTER TELLS ME THAT BEFORE HIS MURDER,
- WILD BILL HICKOK ASKED YOU TO LOOK TO HER INTERESTS.
- YES, SIR.
HAD YOU RIDDEN WITH HICKOK ON THE PLAINS?
I MET HIM IN THE CAMP.
I ONLY KNEW HIM A FEW DAYS.
AND IMPRESSED HIM AT ONCE AS BEING TRUSTWORTHY.
THEY RESCUED A CHILD IN THE WILDERNESS
AND BROUGHT TO JUSTICE ONE OF THE MEN WHO MURDERED HER FAMILY.
AND, UM, HOW WAS JUSTICE METED OUT?
WE SHOT HIM.
SLAB OF BEEF OFF THE CHUCK,
BOILED WHOLE CARROTS AND LITTLE BROWN POTATOES.
FRESH BAKED BREAD AND RHUBARB PIE TO COME.
- YOUR REPAST AWAITS YOUR MOUTHS.
- THANK YOU.
POSTPRANDIAL CIGARS FOR THE MENFOLK.
OH NO, WE HAVE OUR OWN SMOKES.
I HOPE YOU BROUGHT RAVENOUS APPETITES.
THANK YOU, MR. FARNUM.
HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
WOULD YOU PREFER, MR. BULLOCK,
THAT ALMA STAY IN THE CAMP?
IN ANY CASE, I'VE DECIDED TO STAY.
AS HER ADVISOR, I MEAN?
IT'S MRS. GARRET'S AFFAIR.
IF SHE WANTED TO GO BACK EAST,
HER INTEREST HERE COULD BE SEEN TO.
BUT I DON'T.
WELL, AND IT WOULD SHOW HER IN A BETTER LIGHT
SHOULD TITLE BE CONTESTED.
THE CUSTOM IS IF YOU GIVE A CLAIM YOUR EFFORTS AND STAKED IT
OR BOUGHT IT FAIR, SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO GO SOME TO TAKE IT AWAY.
WE'VE TAKEN STEPS TO DEMONSTRATE HER ACTIVITY.
OF COURSE, IF THE NEW YORK COURTS HAD JURISDICTION,
THEY'D SELL THE HOLDINGS TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.
NOT MANY HERE WOULD GIVE A DAMN WHAT A NEW YORK COURT HELD OR DIDN'T.
- EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE.
-ON THE CONTRARY, MR. BULLOCK,
THANK YOU FOR ACKNOWLEDGING MY PRESENCE.
I THOUGHT, BUTTON, THAT YOU WERE OUR ENTIRE PREOCCUPATION.
E.B.:
THE MAN'S A CHARLATAN, RICHARDSON.
A CHEAT, A BROAD TOSSER AND A CLIP.
I ONLY WONDER...
IF THE DAUGHTER'S BEEN IN IT WITH HIM,
OR SHE'S HIS PIGEON.
- MAY I LOOK, MR. FARNUM?
- YES.
WHEN YOU'VE GROWN A FULL HEAD OF HAIR.
BRASS, THAT WOULD BE...
TO GULL YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD.
( saloon piano playing )
- MR. SWEARENGEN.
- YOU OWE ME $5.
IF YOU ASS-FUCKED HER, YOU OWE ME SEVEN.
- NO.
- YOU DIDN'T ASS-FUCK HER?
I'M NOT PAYING YOU.
- IT WASN'T TO DO WITH YOU, IT WASN'T BUSINESS.
- TRIXIE!
DON'T THINK I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I MEAN, WHAT CAN ANY ONE OF US
EVER REALLY FUCKING HOPE FOR, HUH?
EXCEPT FOR A MOMENT HERE AND THERE WITH A PERSON
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO ROB, STEAL OR MURDER US?
AT NIGHT, IT MAY HAPPEN.
SUN-UP, ONE PERSON AGAINST THE FUCKING WALL,
THE OTHER MAY HOP ON THE FUCKING BED,
TRUSTED EACH OTHER ENOUGH TO TELL HALF THE FUCKING TRUTH.
EVERYBODY NEEDS THAT.
IT BECOMES PRECIOUS TO 'EM.
THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE IT FUCKED WITH.
- I WON'T PAY.
- YOU PAY...
OR SHE PAYS.
NO HOME VISITS.
DO YOUR VISITING ON THE PREMISES.
FIVE.SEVEN FOR AN ASS-FUCK.
YOU GET BACK TO WORK.
YOU SLEEP TONIGHT AMONGST YOUR OWN.
ANOTHER FUCKING BOTTLE.
IF WE'D HAD A KITCHEN, SOPHIA,
AFTER SUPPER, WE'D HAVE RETIRED TO IT,
TO CHORES AND GOSSIP
ON THE MOST MINUTE DOMESTIC MATTERS,
WHILE THE MEN WALKED AND SMOKED
AND ARGUED MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS...
AND, INCIDENTALLY, DECIDED OUR FATES.
UNDERSTANDABLE, HER LATE HUSBAND WAS SO TAKEN WITH MY DAUGHTER.
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM VERY WELL,
BUT I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZED HIS DOTING INFATUATION.
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM AT ALL.
I'LL ADMIT THAT I HAD HOPED SHE MIGHT FIND A MAN
WHO WOULD DOTE ON HER AND MORE,
PERHAPS HAD A SURER SENSE OF WHAT THE WORLD WAS.
AND, APPARENTLY,
I'M ENTITLED TO HOPE THAT AGAIN.
MY WIFE AND SON WILL BE JOINING ME SOON.
I'M LONG PAST JUDGMENT, MR. BULLOCK,
AND I'VE LEARNED THAT NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY
OR HOW CIVIL THEY SEEM,
THEIR PASSIONS RULE.
I SEE NO REASON WHY YOUR WIFE AND SON'S ARRIVAL
NEED ALTER MY HOPES FOR MY DAUGHTER'S HAPPINESS
OR SECURITY OR THE SECURITY OF HER HOLDINGS.
I'LL SAY GOOD NIGHT, MR. RUSSELL,
WITH THANKS FOR DINNER.
THAT WILL DISAPPOINT ALMA.
I'M SURE SHE DIDN'T THINK SHE WAS SAYING GOOD NIGHT
- WHEN WE LEFT FOR OUR WALK.
- SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
IF I HAVE OFFENDED YOU,
I'VE ACCOMPLISHED THE OPPOSITE OF MY INTENTION,
WHICH WOULD NOT BE AN UNPRECEDENTED RESULT.
- I JUST WANT TO SAY GOOD NIGHT.
- OF COURSE.
- GOOD NIGHT, MR. BULLOCK.
- GOOD NIGHT THEN.
TRUST ME TO EXPLAIN TO ALMA.
I'M A PRACTICED AND INVETERATE LIAR.
IF WE DIDN'T HATE THEM TOO MUCH TO BE CURIOUS ABOUT THE WORLD...
WE'D WONDER WHAT THEY'D HAD TO SAY.
CRAPS!
LOSER!
LINE AWAY.
YOU BETTER NOT NEED THEM FINGERS, HOSS,
IF YOU SPILL THAT DRINK ON MY GODDAMN FELT TOO.
HAND THAT STICK TO A CAPTAIN OF THE FLOATING TABLE, CY.
- EDDIE SAWYER.
- BACK IN ACTION IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
YOU NEED TO TAKE IT BACK ABOUT THAT BOY, CY,
ME BEING INTERESTED THAT WAY.
AW, HELL, EDDIE, YOU KNOW ME.
I GET IN A BROWN STUDY, I SAY ANY GODDAMN THING COMES TO MIND.
WITHDRAWN WITH APOLOGIES.
COMING OUT.NEW SHOOTER.
ARE WE THAT FAR WEST THAT WE'VE WOUND UP IN FUCKING CHINA?
WHERE A WHITE MAN KOWTOWS TO A CELESTIAL
LIKE THAT ARROGANT COCKSUCKER WU!
TAKE IT EASY, LEON.
IT STICKS IN MY CRAW, MR. TOLLIVER.
DO I HAVE MY WEAKNESSES?
YES.
BUT I WILL NOT HAVE A FUCKING CHINK COURIER ROB ME BLIND
AND HAVE MY FRIEND JIMMY IRONS ROBBED BLIND
IN THE COURSE OF FEEDING OFF OUR FUCKING WEAKNESSES!
OR HAVE THAT COURIER'S FUCKING CHINK BOSS
ISSUE AN ORDER TO AL SWEARENGEN
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SO FUCKING TOUGH
TO TURN ONE OF US OVER!
SWEARENGEN KOWTOWS AND TURNS ONE OF US OVER
TO BE EATEN BY THE FUCKING CHINESE PIGS!
THIS FUCKING GETS TO ME.
I CAN'T PUT IT OUT OF MY FUCKING MIND!
LEON, LEON, LEON.
THIN IT OUT, LEON.
PRUNE THE PATTER DOWN, HMM?
FOR THE WINNER, PAY THE FIELD.
- HI, EDDIE.
- HIYA, KITTEN.
- YOU AND CY RECONCILED?
- THICK AS THIEVES.
AND IF I WEREN'T AS GOOD AT WHAT I DID,
YOU'D SEE I JUST PALMED 80 IN CHIPS
FOR THE JOANIE STUBBS CONSTRUCTION FUND.
- HI, CY.
- HI, JOANIE.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING GIVING JOANIE THE OFFICE, EDDIE?
SAYING "WELCOME HOME."
ARE YOU HOME, HONEY?
I GAVE UP WAITING FOR THAT SEARCH PARTY YOU DIDN'T SEND, CY.
MIND IF I SHOW JOANIE MY PEACOCK, EDDIE?
- FIND LAND FOR YOUR PLOT YET?
- I'M STILL LOOKING.
I SEE THE PEST TENT'S COMING DOWN.
AH, IT'S TOO FAR OFF TILL THE CAMP EXPANDS.
YOU'D WANT A MORE CENTRAL PLOT, SAY FRONTING COCHRAN'S ALLEY.
WELL, THOSE ALL SEEM TOOK BY CHINESE.
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW THAT SHIT'S GONNA SHAKE OUT.
THOSE CHINESE COCKSUCKERS!
A NEW SHOOTER COMING OUT!
( cheering )
THAT MAN'S NOT HERE TO HELP HIS DAUGHTER.
HE'S LOOKING TO ROOT AT HER CLAIM.
YOU WENT TO SEE THAT WHORE AGAIN?
I GUESS SHE HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR HER BEING OUTSIDE,
AND SWEARENGEN SENT FOR ME TO PAY HIM HIS FEE.
I GUESS SHE TOLD HIM WHERE SHE'D BEEN.
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ME HE FOUND OUT FROM, SOL,
'CAUSE I'M SOMETIMES THAT STUPID.
YOU THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN YOU?
I'M SURE IT WAS,
SPEAKING WITHOUT THINKING,
JUSTIFYING BEING IN HIS PLACE.
BEING YOU'D BEEN OUSTED FROM YOUR OWN.
I WAS HOT SEEING THAT TINHORN STAPLETON
GETTING INSTALLED AS SHERIFF,
AND I USED POOR FUCKING JUDGMENT.
SORRY MRS. GARRET'S PA TURNS OUT A SHITHEEL.
COLD ENOUGH WORLD WITHOUT GETTING GONE AGAINST BY YOUR OWN.
NOW, I SEE WHAT THE FUCK'S IN FRONT OF ME,
AND I DON'T PRETEND IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.
I WAS FUCKING HER BUT NOW I'M GONNA FUCK YOU,
IF YOU DON'T PISS ME OFF
OR OPEN YOUR YAP AT THE WRONG FUCKING TIME.
THE ONLY TIME YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO OPEN YOUR YAP
IS SO I CAN PUT MY FUCKING PRICK IN IT.
OTHERWISE, YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP.
NOW, HOLD ONTO THAT, HUH?
THE POINT IS,
THIS MINISTER'S GOTTA FUCKING DIE.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE-- THAT'S THE FUCKING POINT.
HE'S GONNA DIE SOONER OR LATER.
I MEAN, HE'S MAKING A FUCKING JERK OF HIMSELF,
AND, I MEAN, WELL, WHY-WHY GO ON WITH THAT?
WHO'S-WHO'S GONNA BENEFIT FROM THAT, HUH?
NO, YOU JUST GOTTA KILL IT AND PUT AN END TO IT.
YOU DON'T LINGER ON ABOUT IT,
YOU DON'T FUCKING GO AROUND WEEPING ABOUT IT,
AND YOU DON'T, YOU KNOW,
BEHAVE LIKE A KID WITH SORE THUMB,
LOCO SUCKING IT.
NOW, "MM, MY POOR FUCKING THUMB!"
I MEAN, YOU-
- YOU GOTTA BEHAVE LIKE A GROWN FUCKING MAN, HUH?
YOU GOTTA SHUT THE FUCK UP,
DON'T BE SORRY, DON'T LOOK FUCKING BACK,
BECAUSE, BELIEVE ME, NO ONE GIVES A FUCK.
- YOU UNDERSTAND?
-YEAH.
YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP, HUH?
GIMME THAT!
HEY, YOU SUCK MY DICK
AND SHUT THE FUCK UP, HUH?
NOW THEN, HERE.
THE PLACE WHERE I FOUND YOU, HUH,
IS WHERE THIS WARRANT'S FROM.
COULD YOU BELIEVE
THAT I MAY HAVE STUCK A KNIFE IN SOMEONE'S GUTS 12 HOURS BEFORE YOU GOT ON THE WAGON
WE HEADED OUT FOR FUCKING LARAMIE?
NO!
BECAUSE I DON'T LOOK FUCKING BACKWARDS.
I DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO AND GO ON.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA...
WHAT?
YOU GOT A STAGECOACH TO CATCH OR SOMETHING, HUH?
SLOW THE FUCK UP.
DID YOU KNOW THE ORPHANAGE PART OF THE BUILDING YOU LIVED IN,
BEHIND IT SHE RAN A WHOREHOUSE, HUH?
OH, SO YOU KNEW?
SO, SO WHAT ARE YOU FUCKING LOOKING AT THEN, HUH?
GOD.
NOW, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW.
BEFORE SHE RAN A GIRLS' ORPHANAGE,
FAT MRS. FUCKING ANDERSON
RAN THE BOYS' ORPHANAGE ON FUCKING EUCLID AVENUE,
AS I WOULD SEE HER FAT ASS WADDLING OUT THE BOYS' DORMITORY
AT 5:00 IN THE FUCKING MORNING,
EVERY FUCKING MORNING AFTER SHE BLEW HER STUPID FUCKING COWBELL
AND WOKE US ALL THE FUCK UP.
AND MY FUCKING MOTHER DROPPED ME THE FUCK OFF THERE
WITH $7 AND 60 SOME-ODD FUCKING CENTS
ON HER WAY TO SUCKING COCK IN...
IN GEORGIA.
AND I DIDN'T GET TO COUNT THE FUCKING CENTS
BEFORE THE FUCKING DOOR OPENED, AND THERE,
MRS. FAT-ASS FUCKING ANDERSON,
WHO SOLD YOU TO ME.
I HAD TO GIVE HER $7 AND 60-ODD FUCKING CENTS
THAT MY MOTHER SHOVED IN MY FUCKING HAND
BEFORE SHE HAMMERED ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR TIMES
ON THE DOOR AND SCURRIED OFF DOWN FUCKING EUCLID AVENUE,
PROBABLY 30 FUCKING YEARS BEFORE YOU WERE FUCKING BORN.
THEN AROUND CAPE HORN AND UP TO SAN FRANCISCO,
WHERE SHE PROBABLY BECAME MAYOR
OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF SUCCESS STORY, UNLESS BY SOME FUCKING CHANCE
SHE WOUND UP AS A DITCH FOR FUCKING CUM.
NOW FUCKING GO FASTER, HMM?
( grunting )
OKAY, GO AHEAD AND SPIT IT OUT.
YOU DON'T NEED TO SWALLOW.
JUST SPIT IT OUT.
ANYWAYS.

All right.
Evening.
Evening back.
Look at that paint, charlie.
I seen it.
I had a happy just like that.
Foundered.
- Makes me miserable reminiscing on it.
- Do you know the owner?
If he'd sell the horse is what he really wants to know.
Well, i don't know if he'd sell.
But the fuckin' jerk's in that bunkhouse.
- Thank you.
- Evenin'.
Jack mccall.
I'm done.
I don't wanna play no more.
Bein' a loudmouth cunt, i guess some time since he's been here, this fella who don't wanna play no more probably spoke of killin' wild bill hickok.
Well, we're bill hickok's friends.
- I'm seth bullock.
- I'm charlie utter.
And if you got your head blown off sitting' here with your back turned, that'd be as fair a play as you gave him.
Guess you wanna soften him up some before you make your offer?
My plan is to take him to yankton for trial.
If you got a different idea, you can ride ahead.
Nah.
Let's take the cocksucker to yankton.
I don't know of a henry anderson in camp, but that don't mean there ain't.
This was took of him in the union army.
He'd be 12 years older now.
Could you let her hold it?
With so much showing, it's pretty near falling' apart.
Here.
Third from the middle.
Right uh...
right there?
Yeah.
That face don't...
don't look familiar.
Thanks for lookin'.
You definite he's in these hills?
Wrote from bismarck, said he'd send for us when he got set up.
I just gotta say it's no guarantee your dad's anywhere near this area.
And there's no fuckin' joy in me telling you that, but it's the goddamned truth and the way human beings are.
- He said he'd send for our mother and us.
- Is your mama here?
She passed.
Sorry.
Well, good luck.
Do you know of...
of work for me?
- No.
- She can get work right here.
- "no, sir. " - "no, thank you. "
- Can youpush a broom?
- And i could start now.
Four bits a day.
I bet you'd like the first in advance.
If you wouldn't mind.
Same for her, as regrets for me being such a ruffian.
Here you go, honey.
If i don't fire him first, you can pick him up at 10:00.
Thank you, sir.
I'll wait for you, miles.
Find a safe place to wait, you hear?
We teach a special sweeping' technique here.
Follow her lead.
It's all right, son.
It's all right.
Um... excuse me.
I'm required to be at the graveyard.
The widow garret is laying her husband to rest.
I'd have bet a month's wages that burial would've took place in new york city, if i had a fuckin' paying' job.
The uh... wet cloth to his lips seems to give him some relief.
- All right.
- Thank you.
What do you think of my patient, doc?
You might wanna steer clear of his reflection for a while, but you're symptom-free.
You ain't contagious no more and you can't get re-infected, so...
- them as heals under my care stay fuckin' healed.
- Thanks, doc.
I got clothes for you back here.
Hereafter in calamity, i'll be sure to call for jane.
You gonna stick around the camp?
I believe i will for a while.
Good, 'cause i wanna monitor your activities, find out what you do that weighs so heavy on your conscience.
When i first come on you in the woods, all you could say was, "i apologize. "
Before you exhibit your johnson, i'm gonna see to this fella.
So long.
Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you.
- All right.
- You're on your own for alterations.
- Hmm.
Now i'm gonna lay this cloth on your fuckin' lips.
There's mr.
Star to collect us.
Mr. Star has been ever so attentive.
- Very considerate.
- To you.
- When we leave the hotel, my boss will be watchin'.
- Shall i reel and stagger?
I... i know the risk lying to him has put you to.
I've... i can't imagine why i'd make it the subject of humor.
You're feeling better.
- Am i early?
- Good morning, mr.
Star.
I'll be ready in just a moment.
- I can have a cup of coffee downstairs.
- No, not at all.
Wait, wait in here, with trixie.
I'll just be a moment.
That widow ain't high.
Maybe waiting till after the service.
When she'd wanna get good and fucking loaded is before the fucking service, against all the fucking carrying on.
- What do you think?
- Makes sense.
Meaning all that whore's been telling me the last 10 fucking days about seeing the widow taking the dope, and your own fucking assurances, you verify that she's loaded personally... you're both full of shit.
I checked in on the woman daily.
If i was fooled, perhaps i've chosen simplemindedness, al, over realizing a certain friend has used me as an instrument of purposes he concealed.
Say what you're gonna say, or prepare for eternal fucking silence.
I don't believe you commissioned me to make an offer on the widow's claim to keep the regulators off you, al.
I think someone found something out there you want.
Assume you ain't been privy to the ins and outs of that matter for the sake of fucking conversation, huh?
I mean, was i asleep, e. b., when you and me declared undying loyalty and full faith mutual disclosure about every fucking detail of every fucking move
- we were ever gonna fucking make together?
- You used me as a pawn, al.
And you fucked up the game is the central fucking present issue.
We agreed on 2,000.
You want a fucking percentage instead?
Is that such an inconceivable proposition?
- Yeah, you got a percentage, e. b.
- How big?
Two percent of the first million, half a percent after.
You wanna feel a damp palm, al, select either of these hands.
Just get to the funeral, e.
b.
Go to 20 if you have to.
Just get that fucking claim.
20 if i have to.
My word.
What a handsome man.
Wish i could tell you i recognize him.
Thank you anyway.
- Your dad, i expect.
- Yes.
You have reason to think he's out here?
He wrote us from bismarck he'd be prospecting the hills.
- "Us" being?
- My brother.
He just got work over here.
Good for him.
So it's just the two of you?
Our mother passed, why we come from buffalo.
- And you're out here looking for your dad.
- Yes.
- Uh, henry?
- Yes.
Out here looking for her father, eddie.
Her and her older brother.
Got a photograph, i don't...
i don't recognize the likeness.
No.
- Henry anderson?
- Yes.
- Yeah, i don't recognize him.
- Mm.
What are you gonna do while your brother works?
Work too, while we're looking to set aside, if we have to move on.
Ah, if dad doesn't turn up here.
Yeah, what do you do?
Cook, clean, sew, sweep.
Uh-huh.
- How quick do you learn?
- Guess i learnpretty quick.
Maestro.
We are strangers and sojourners.
"Mr. Garret's" "burial place"
is a great distance from new york city.
But his heart... ingrid... marta.
- "and on" the great day...
- mama.
- "his father will" take him into it.
- Papa.
As he will all who confess his son savior
"from wherever" we may be put to rest.
"Our hymn is" "a mighty fortress. "
- my sympathies, madam but, my own requirements force me to ignore what's seemly.
I must decide where to place my capital.
Might raising my offer to say, $19,500, uh, prompt you to an immediate answer?
- No, mr.
Farnum.
- "I would as soon not see bill now.
I'll see him some other time.
Come on.
i will require a decision within 24 hours... please, stop speaking to me, mr.
Farnum.
i hope you ain't gived up on that little runt of a girl, al.
Oh, do you worry for her, dan?
Wandering the muck of our thoroughfare, her tiny self all but swallowed up in horseshit?
Hey, kid!
Come here.
- Yes, sir?
- Stand with us here a second.
What are...
what are we doing?
Waiting.
And out the door he'll go, and prompt as a swiss fucking timepiece three big-tittied whores will now emerge from behind that screen.
He lines 'em up at two-foot intervals, smock tops down, and all but sprints past 'em, giving their titties a lick.
And if he misses a titty, does not let himself retrace his steps.
- Don't tell me.
- Yeah, and then he goes on his way home, relieved for the day.
What's your name?
It's miles, huh?
- Miles, yeah.
- Yeah.
Strange, huh, miles?
But something you gotta know about specialists.
They pay a premium and they never cause fucking trouble.
I sometimes imagine in my declining years running a small joint in manchester, england, catering to specialists exclusive.
And to let 'em know they're amongst their own, i'll operate from the corner, hanging upside down like a fucking bat, hmm?
- Oh, we're not such bad sorts here, huh, miles?
- No, sir.
So do you wanna ask your sister if she'd like to reconsider, hmm?
- You don'treally mean that, mr.
Swearengen.
- Of course i don't mean it.
How dare you suggest i'd mean a thing like that, huh?
I did my part.
Raised our offer to 20 and demanded answer within the day.
But what, you cocksucker?
Complications have ensued:
Bullock's come back.
I expect she'll wanna take counsel with him.
Tell the whore i wanna see her.
And i trust this doesn't alter our agreement.
I trust you know 2% of nothing's fucking nothing.
That fella from montana i knew to trust won't be able to assay your claim.
- I see.
- We'll engage someone local, and i'll keep an eye on him.
As i've decided to stay in camp, mr.
Bullock, at least for the near term, i hope you'll feel absolved of those responsibilities towards my interest that you undertook at mr.
Hickok's request.
I prefer to see 'em through.
They're properly mine.
I even feel marginally capable of shouldering them and i certainly realize that you and mr.
Star have responsibilities of your own.
Are you firing me, mrs.
Garret?
I'm offering you absolution.
Otherwise i'm staying on.
I'm so sorry you were hurt.
So, how hard are they coming at you to sell?
I could confide that in an effort to blur my judgment, mr.
Swearengen engaged intermediaries to indulge me with opium.
But that would entail acknowledging that i've had a weakness in that direction.
Uh... more appropriately, uh, i could add at the graveyard mr.
Farnum raised his offer
$7,500, presumably also on mr.
Swearengen's instruction, and set a 24-hour limit to my reply.
Under the circumstances, i'd say that's coming pretty hard.
Please forgive me for making you uncomfortable, mr.
Bullock.
I had better manners before i began to abstain.
That's all right.
Anyways, are you at risk for the smallpox?
I was inoculated in new york city.
The child whose life you saved presumably has not been, but i assume she's safer under my care than traveling in a covered wagon with strangers.
Anyways, i'll line up the assayer.
Thank you.
You are changed.
You seem to be too.
Our stock's depleted, but we are offering a 100% discount on any item that catches your eye.
I've got money.
Our special get- acquainted-with-those- we'd-like-to-get- acquainted-with sale.
Mr. Utter.
I brought these pickaxes for you to sell.
There's two sifters on that black cayuse out there.
Mighty grateful, sir.
You got this place just about built, don't you?
Saving the last master-strokes for seth.
Oh, hello.
I didn't see you.
Hello.
Hey, that's that little girl, isn't it?
Taking care of her for mrs.
Garret.
As much as she favors you, she could be yours.
I lost the receipts for my costs.
Maybe while you was busy saving my partner's life.
Let me get these sifters for you.
See if you can make those accounts add up.
I don't know if you heard me inside thanking you for helping my friend.
I heard you.
It's all right.
I'm sorry you lost yours.
All right.
Thank you.
Welcome back, mr.
Utter.
We've had a mild increase in rates, but i do have a room available.
I'll see.
What do you want, mr.
Farnum?
I have a message for trixie that's looking to that orphan child.
- "she's to see her" longer-term employer.
- I'll tell her.
You know who that is?
I know she works at the gem.
And even so, admit her to your trade at public hours.
Congratulations, sir, on your advanced thinking.
Al wants you, trixie.
Stickler for self-delivered messages.
Our dad ain't here.
I know it, even if my brother don't.
Maybe he never even tried to get here.
Or maybe he did try to get here and couldn't, maybe something happened to him.
There's so many ways it could be, flora, it's not much point deciding which it was.
He'd never think that, though, my brother.
Must be how he needs to do.
I ain't a virgin... if you wanna know that.
I had a boyfriend in buffalo.
Well, was you upset to have to leave him?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
I was upset.
At the same time he was a stupid son of a bitch.
And rough.
Here.
You can't tell my brother about him.
He'd make it back to buffalo and shoot lewis in the head.
All that way in defense of your virtue?
That's more trouble than i ever took with it.
Cy.
Lazarus risen.
Look at you, you son of a gun.
Hello, cy.
Good to see you, andy.
Don't be afraid to shake with me, eddie.
I ain't contagious no more.
Highly becoming outfit.
I'm here for my belongings.
Look... they're gone, andy.
Measures to stop the spread.
Ah hell, the important thing is you're well.
I'll front you whatever you need.
Let's get something going, hmm?
- Andy?
- In the flesh, sweetheart.
- Which ain't much to look at.
- You made it, andy.
Oh, and we ain't getting nothing going.
All i come back for, cy, was my things, and you tossed them too.
Why don't you take this and get yourself outta that clown outfit?
Once you've cooled off a little, think how you'd have done different when somebody showed up in the shape you was in and my responsibilities to meet.
Better than to throw him in the woods to fucking die?
Then don't think about nothing, andy.
Use the money for a whore and a toot and go join the fucking circus.
Did you turn her out?
Her brother's gonna be a problem.
Fuck her brother.
We'll handle the brother if we have to kill the cocksucker.
That's an interesting piece of strange.
Ain't you a picture?
- What is it?
- Hmm?
Oh, am i detaining you in some way?
Am i fucking imposing?
Mrs. Garret's to sit down with bullock.
I thought you'd want me over there.
Oh yeah, so you can bring me a full and fair report, huh?
But will the widow have her wits about her, trixie, huh?
Or will they be passing the opium pipe like heathens between 'em, her and fucking bullock, hmm?
- What're you pissed off for?
- I ain't pissed off.
I'm in fucking wonderment.
I'm waiting to be kept happy by the next fucking fairy tale.
Do you want me back at the hotel or do you wanna do something to me?
Now why would i want you to go back there, huh?
Or rely on anything you said transpired after you lied about her taking dope, huh?
Her being high... wasn't gonna have nothing to do with whether or not she sold you that claim, and she wanted to get off the dope.
And that little one needs someone to care for her... and maybe get her the fuck outta here.
And i knew it wasn't gonna be me.
So you want me back over there and to tell you what they fucking decide?
Or do you wanna rip my fucking guts out?
You get back there quick.
"Don't kid" yourself, trixie.
Don't get a mistaken idea.
Mr. Utter.
This is where bill got killed, huh?
Uh... i'll be sorry about that for as long as i live.
Can you tell me about it?
Yeah.
It... it was about sun-up over at that bella union joint, mr.
Hickok plum gutted mccall at draw.
And now here mr.
Hickok was at poker again.
Say a couple hours of daylight left and in come that coward mccall.
Walked up on him and shot him in the head.
Bill never know when he come in.
Uh, those of us that did, we didn't have no inkling of what he intended.
He just murdered him, right where he sat.
If i may, sir... this is here where wild bill was sitting when mccall entered from the front, approached the table, causing no apprehension
"'cause he had often" frequented the game.
Of a sudden, mccall produced a revolver and shouting "take that, damn you!" He fired.
Muzzle couldn't have been three inches from wild bill's head.
Now i'm told that hickok fell dead immediately, but i won't testify to it, because the bullet, after it passed through wild bill's brain, struck me in my right wrist, and i lost several seconds to pain before regaining my senses.
Sir, you have my word as eyewitness to the rest, and i suppose this wound as added proof for the doctors they feared crippled me in the hand i use to write.
I will take the murderer's bullet to my grave.
Thanks.
Aces over eights, as i just now recall.
That is the hand that wild bill had.
Sure, captain.
Sure.
You like how that falls?
Sure.
- Do you like it, flora?
- Why not?
I'd prefer you happy, honey, but if you can't be, you need to pretend at it better than you're doing or you're gonna be hungry and cold and getting done to you for nothing outside
what you'd have made money to live on and save up besides if you acted the part in here.
I thought i only had to act it with them that wanna stick it in me.
You never know who that might be, flora.
There you go.
I prefer you happy.
Or at least pretending better?
I think he's dead, doc.
Could you tell the litter bearers not to make so much of getting this one outta here?
- Has young joey gone to dust?
- Yeah.
As flesh must, to be restored by the savior's return.
Oh, mr.
Bullock is back among us, and also, also mr.
Utter.
Does charlie know about bill?
They were together, mr.
Bullock and he.
They'd captured jack mccall.
I hope that's only the beginning of what they fucking did to him.
- Gave him over to the federal authorities.
- Gave him over?
- Rendered unto caesar.
- Jesus christ.
Mr... mr.
Bullock was struck by an indian's axe.
Marked like the first-born of adam and eve.
- Are you drunk?
- No.
- What the fuck is that?
- He's all right.
All right, reverend.
All right, reverend.
All right.
You're all right, reverend.
All right.
He marks us sinful and forgiven by confession.
All right.
He has told us and shown us.
He has told me.
All right.
You listen to me now, reverend.
You are goddamn exhausted, and you give yourself no respite.
These seizures may owe something to that, but it also wouldn't surprise me if you had a lesion in your goddamn head, and that's what's giving you the seizures and generating your chats with the goddamn divinity.
No goddamn offense intended.
- None taken, sir.
- Now get outta here,
- and get yourself some rest!
- "go on, reverend. "
Doc's tired too, the only reason he's talking so fucking harsh.
Could not the lesion be the instrument of god's instructive intention, doctor, if i am so afflicted?
Well, of course it could, his ways not being ours and so forth.
But could he not, reverend, just want you getting out of here and getting yourself some goddamn rest?
- You have to go now.
- We don't have todo nothing, i'd pay the same price just to sit with you.
My brother works in this place up here, and he keeps a hard watch.
If you wanna stick it in me tomorrow, you better let me go in by myself.
- What time are you gonna start?
- 11:00, i guess.
I'll be receiving around noon.
All right, flora.
Here's a dollar anyway.
You're swell.
Evening.
Evening, miss.
- You're early.
- Yes.
- I guess no luck finding your dad.
- No, no luck.
I knew you would've had a cheerier look on your face if you had.
Let me get you a place to sit away from these rough sons of bitches.
Hey!
Do your drinking at the bar or get the fuck out of here!
You have a seat here.
I'll get you a beverage.
Do you want a soft cider or a sarsaparilla?
- Cider if it's not a trouble.
- Soft cider.
Did she find her dad?
Her chances of finding her dad are greater than yours of walking out of this door upright, unless you shut your fucking mouth.
You got it?
Swearengen's had his hand on the tiller far as getting dealing with this epidemic.
- "is that so?"
- Yeah, the dead don't drink or chase women must be his thinking on that subject.
That indian fought like hell.
I'd guess you did too.
Charlie figured out how it must have been.
The indian had to kill me for coming on the burial place, and maybe it had been me, too, that killed his friend, cut his friend's head off so he wouldn't have eyes to see the sunset
all those years he'd be lying there dead.
So he had to kill me for that too.
And he couldn't before he'd laid hands on me or the killing wouldn't be honorable.
We fought like fucking hell, i'll tell you that much, and i never once had the upper-hand.
It just happened out the way it happened out.
He was just trying to live, same as me, and do honor to his friend, and make some fucking sense out of things.
And we wind up that way, and i wind up after beating him till i couldn't recognize his face.
For christ's sake!
That indian saved jack mccall's life,
- i'll tell you that fucking much.
- Not for long.
Brian macdonald's not coming.
I want his recommendation who should assay that widow's claim.
- "whose?"
- Swearengen's.
Shit, seth.
Get his opinion, too, who should guard that henhouse we're gonna build.
So... are you okay?
- Yes, and you?
- Yes.
They're nice here.
And mr.
Swearengen, he's funny as all get-out.
So what place would make a better score?
Where i'm working.
But why not take 'em both?
- Could we have a private talk?
- Sure we can.
- Should i be armed?
- Where do you wanna talk?
Come here.
What do you think of that?
I think that son of a bitch better stop looking evil at that little girl.
- So was it mccall who improved your appearance?
- No.
Whoever got the job done, i hope you gave as good as you got.
It's good to have you back, with me being superstitious and all hell breaking loose when you left.
I'm here to talk about mrs.
Garret.
They planted her husband this morning?
I wrote a man about coming to assay her claim,
- but he can't make it.
- Plenty of local alternatives.
I want you to nominate someone.
Do you?
So if any way his work was mistaken, i'd be coming after you.
- You would?
- Yeah.
Since i got nothing to do with the venture, what if i decline to make the recommendation?
Then you better hope whoever i find does his job right, 'cause i'm still holding you accountable.
I ain't involved.
E.b. Farnum offered on her claim.
Farnum's your water-boy and i know what you've been trying to do to her.
So here you come in all nobility... threatening me with a dire result if the property of that widow's husband thought worthless from when it sold, turns out not to be pinched out.
You and i know how it is, mr.
Swearengen.
- How what is?
- She gets a square shake, or i come for you.
What if i come for you?
Are you ready for that?
I guess i'd better be.
Then close your fucking store, 'cause being ready for me will take care of your waking hours and you better have someone to hand the task off to when you close your eyes.
We understand each other.
Al!
Al!
Jesus fucking christ!
Walk right past me, your holiness, so i can shut my fucking office.
Al!
Go on!
Stare at her now!
Huh?
You like fucking little girls?
Take a look at that little girl 'cause she's the last thing you're ever gonna see.
- Stare at her now, cocksucker.
- "let him down!"
Let him fucking down!
Or should i have had him hold him up?
You head what i said about the widow.
Oh yes, your holiness.
You heard me too.
So i take it this was a fair fucking fight, yeah?
Yeah!
That's right!
Two free drinks for everybody.
And drinks all night for them that help with the disposal.
hat's me!
I'm sorry that you had to see that.
Shut the fuck up, dan, and get her the fuck away from here... now!
Come on.
I'm sorry, mr.
Swearengen.
I warned him not to look at her.
I warned him.
Fucking pussy.
That joey passed this afternoon.
Been suffering awful.
But that frog-looking fellow left the tent that i found up in the woods, left the tent fucking cure pronounced by the doc himself.
And in the dumbest looking outfit a grown man ever wore.
Who's there, god damn it?
!
Who the hell's it look like?
How the fuck do i know who it fucking looks like?
It's dark!
Jesus christ, come upon a person unawares in a fucking graveyard!
I heard you was back in the camp.
I heard you and that bullock got the cocksucker did for bill.
Was bill dead by the time you saw him?
Yeah, he was already dead.
Why did he let that son of a bitch get to him?
I don't know, charlie.
Anyways, people don't scare me past speaking, i come up here nights tell him the fucking news.
Go ahead.
Charlie avenged your fucking murder.
And that bullock fella was with me that you seemed to like.
Although it occurred to me to wonder why they didn't do for the cocksucker
- right on the fucking spot.
- Is that something we need to get into in front of him?
You got the biggest mouth in the territory.
You talk to him.
Tell him whatever you want.
I got that mail route in cheyenne that we talked about.
I was bringing back supplies to them hardware boys and i run into that bullock fella.
He was out there looking for that mccall that... that killed you.
And he run into some heathen boy and he had one hell of a fight.
Boy, and he just...
he got... he got f... he got f-f... fuck.
Can I... can i tell him some more tomorrow?
Sure, what the fuck you asking me for?
I don't make the rules.
Wanna go back to the camp?
Please.
And what must mr.
Bullock have been thinking as i inflicted my personal confidences upon him?
- I don't know.
- Nor do i.
At least he kept a decent privacy.
I have to go back to the gem.
He's waiting for me now to tell him yours and mr.
Bullock's thinking about selling the claim, and i won't be able to lie anymore.
Next i tell will be my last.
So i better just get back there.
Mr. Swearengen discovered our deception?
- "yeah. "
- How?
- Looking at you walk out of the fucking hotel.
- "he did not. "
I was careful to see he wasn't watching in the window.
It don't matter, mrs.
Garret.
The point is, i gotta go back.
And you need someone to look to this child, and with choices bigger elsewhere and nothing i can tell to hold you here, maybe you better think about selling and getting out.
Would you wanna take the girl and go?
Where?
- I have no people anywhere.
- You could goto new york.
L- i could have my relatives there see you established.
What the fuck?
What would keep you here?
You wanna fuck this man?
Fuck him, then think about the child... don't use that language with me, trixie, or that tone... don't you wanna say to remember my place?
I do, you rich cunt.
And i'm going back to it.
She's about to say her name, you know.
She named her sisters and her folks.
Think of selling.
If you took her away, you could hear her say it.
( theme music playing )
( sighs )
( under breath ) YEAH.
WHAT WAS IN MY MIND TO RAISE MY HAND?
ANYWAYS,
TIME FOR BREAKFAST.
- YOU GO AHEAD.
- BULLSHIT.
COME ON.
( sighs ) WOULD A LETTER TO THE PAPER BE AN IDEA?
SAME TIME I GIVE THE PROPOSAL TO FARNUM?
- YES.
- MARSHAL PUBLIC SENTIMENT AND FAVOR,
MAYBE FENCE 'EM IN A LITTLE.
- EXCELLENT APPROACH.
- GODDAMN QUICKSAND
IS WHAT THESE COMMISSIONER POSITIONS AMOUNT TO.
YES, THEY DO.
IT'S ALL A HOOT AND A HOLLER TO YOU, THOUGH, ISN'T IT, SOL?
- NO, IT ISN'T.
- JESUS CHRIST.
- BREAKFAST VITTLES AT THE READY, GENTLEMEN.
- MAYOR.
AS FAR AS USE FOR THE FEES TO BE LEVIED ON BUSINESSES,
I WORKED A PROPOSAL UP ON A PERMANENT INFIRMARY AND A CAMP DUMP.
THE FIRST USE FOR THOSE FEES
IS PAYING BRIBES TO THE LEGISLATURE.
THEIR BAGMAN'S IN TRANSIT.
- WELL, IF THERE'S ANYTHING FUCKING LEFT.
- WHY, MR. BULLOCK,
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU WANT TO WRING MY NECK.
- ( chuckles )
- SUBMIT YOUR IDEAS, BULLOCK, AND BY ALL MEANS,
I'LL TAKE THEM UNDER ADVISEMENT.
ALWAYS GLAD TO HEAR FROM THE CAMP HEALTH COMMISSIONER.
- GIVE THE IDEA TO THE DAMN PAPER FIRST.
- ( clucks )
- ( whinnying )
- PLEASE, TAKE YOUR PASSAGE.
COCKSUCKER.

HE WON'T SIT.

I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT AL WOULD WANT.

THOSE ARE THE FIRST "COCKSUCKERS"
I HAVE EVER HEARD SHOUTED FROM THAT ROOM, DAN,
THAT DIDN'T COME FROM AL'S MOUTH
THAT WASN'T FOLLOWED BY AL COMING OVER TO THAT RAILING,
POINTING AT YOU AND BECKONING YOU
UP THEM STAIRS WITH YOUR FUCKING KNIFE.
I BEGRUDGE THAT PERVERT HIS CAPACITY FOR HAPPINESS.
I DO.
THEM PEOPLE WORSHIP A FAT MAN SEATED ON HIS ASS.
Al:

THE BACK WAY, OR WE'LL START GETTING PEOPLE
HAVING THE WRONG FUCKING IDEA OF THINGS AROUND HERE, HUH?
WHERE'S THE DOPE FIEND?
AIN'T SEEN JIMMY IRONS IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS.
FUCKING FIND HIM.
- MORNING, E.B.
- MORNING, SIR.
ANYTHING THE MAYOR SHOULD KNOW?
NAME OF ANOTHER TAILOR.
DIDN'T WE HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT TO STUFF ENVELOPES, AL?
NOT UNTIL I GET THE CURRENCY TO STUFF 'EM WITH.
( Merrick clears throat )
"ANY PERSON WHO CAUSES OFFAL,
MANURE, RUBBISH OR FILTH
TO BE DISCHARGED IN THE COMMON AREAS OF THE CAMP EXCEPT
IN THE AREAS DESIGNATED THE CAMP DUMP,
SHALL BE SUBJECT TO A FINE OF NOT LESS THAN $1
OR MORE THAN $3,
SUCH REVENUES TO BE USED FOR DUMP UPKEEP
AND TO BUILD AND KEEP UP A CAMP INFIRMARY."
THAT'S EXCELLENT, MR. BULLOCK.
- MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING, MR. BULLOCK.
- GENTLEMEN.
- MRS. GARRET.
- GOOD MORNING, MADAM.
- GOOD MORNING.
AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU, YOUNG LADY.
IT'S MR. BULLOCK'S IDEAS ON
REFUSE DISPOSAL.
IT IS TERRIBLY CROWDED TODAY.
- MMM.
- WE WERE JUST REMARKING JUSTYESTERDAY
THAT IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET MORE CROWDED.
AND YET TODAY, IT IS.
I'M GONNA ASK AFTER E.B. FARNUM.
MR. FARNUM'S AWAY FROM THE DESK.
GEM SALOON, ACROSS THE WAY.
TWO ROOMS.
THERE'S NO VACANCY, SIR.
I'LL WORK IT OUT WHILE YOU EAT.
THERE'S A MAN OUTSIDE WITH TWO HORSES.
YOU SEND THE MAN INSIDE, SEE THE HORSES STABLED.
- DON'T ASK NO FUCKING EXTRA FOR IT.
- YES, SIR.
MR. FARNUM'S DOING A LINED OFFICE BUSINESS.
OR SHOULD I SAY "MAYOR" FARNUM?
DON'T, UNLESS YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO.
THAT VERY ATTRACTIVE SOLITARY WOMAN
IS MISS JOANIE STUBBS,
A SUPERVISORY FIGURE
AT CY TOLLIVER'S BELLA UNION SALOON.
- YOUR CRAVAT'S IN YOUR BACON.
- OH.
FUCK THIS!
IS IT FUCKING CROWDED IN HERE
OR YOU JUST GOT SOME BIG FUCKING FEET?
MAYBE IT'S THE LETHAL COMBINATION OF 'EM BOTH.
THIS ONE LEGISLATOR'S NAMED ON THE LIST
YOU WERE GIVEN TWICE, AL.
- LUCALIS CHILDS OF BISMARCK.
- GIVE HIM TWO ENVELOPES.
I'LL CALL HIM ON IT IF IT EVER SUITS MY PURPOSE.
AS DAMP AS YOUR HANDS ARE,
WHY DO YOU CONTINUOUSLY LICK YOUR FUCKING THUMB?
HABIT, I SUPPOSE.
COULD YOU LEARN THE HABIT OF LICKING A FUCKING STUMP?
( chuckles )
IF HEALTH COMMISSIONER BULLOCK HAS HIS WAY,
SOME OF THE LEVIES MEANT TO DEFRAY
THE COST OF THESE PAYOFFS MAY GET DIVERTED.
- TO WHAT?
- INFIRMARY FOR THE CAMP.
- GARBAGE DUMP.
- WELL, THAT TYPE OF SHIT'S INEVITABLE.
E.B.,
STEAL NONE OF THIS MONEY.
GRATUITOUS, HURTFUL AND UNNECESSARY.
WHEN I DEAL WITH THESE COCKSUCKERS DOWN THE ROAD,
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK ANY ONE OF 'EM IN THE EYE,
NAME WHAT THEY WERE PAID
- AND KNOW I'M RIGHT.
- UNDERSTOOD.
INTACT AND UNDIMINISHED.
- WHAT IS IT, AL?
- HALF A CHANCE THIS COULD BE HIM.
THE BAGMAN?
HE WASN'T TO BE HERE TILL TONIGHT.
NAME'S SILAS ADAMS.
I'M LOOKING FOR E.B. FARNUM.
I'M MAYOR E.B. FARNUM, MR. ADAMS.
AND THIS IS AL SWEARENGEN.
I'M TO GIVE THIS TO YOU FROM MAGISTRATE CLAGETT,
AND YOU'RE TO GIVE THOSE TO ME.
POUR YOURSELF AND YOUR FRIEND A DRINK.
STOP!
YOU MOTHERLESS FUCKING WHORES.
FUCK YOU!
- FUCK ME?
!
- GENTLEMEN!
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS HERE?
NO.
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD'VE ASKED ME THAT BEFORE YOU MOTHERFUCKED ME?
A DOUBLE-CROSSING COCKSUCKER.
THAT'S MAGISTRATE CLAGETT.
IS THAT THE MESSAGE YOU WANT ME TO TAKE BACK TO HIM?
THAT'S THE GIST OF IT.
LET ME PUT IT A BETTER WAY BEFORE I SEND YOU
AND YOUR MUTE FRIEND BACK DOWN THE FUCKING TRAIL.
NO LATER THAN TONIGHT.
- YOU GIVING ME A TIME LIMIT?
- YEAH.
PUSSY AND WHISKEY FREE, IF YOU WANT IT.
I MAKE MY OWN ARRANGEMENTS.
MR. ADAMS,
MAY I ACCOMPANY YOU TO MY HOTEL, SIR?
MR. ADAMS?
Johnny:
HEY, AL.
DAN'S GOT JIMMY IRONS.
TELL HIM I'LL RECEIVE HIM
IN MY FUCKING CHAMBERS, OKAY?
GET OUT OF HERE.
- YOU WORK OUT THE ROOMS?
- YOU GOTTA SHARE.
JUST SEND UP TWO PLATES OF FUCKING FOOD.
AND DON'T SPIT IN 'EM, PARTNER.
MR. UTTER.
I'D 'BOUT GIVEN UP HOPE.
YES.
MIGHTY KIND OF YOU, MISS STUBBS.
HOW'S THE FREIGHT BUSINESS WORKING OUT?
ALL A MAN COULD WISH FOR AND VERGING ON MORE THAN HE CAN HANDLE.
( chuckles ) GLAD TO HEAR IT.
HOW'D YOU DO LOOKING FOR YOUR WHOREHOUSE?
I AIN'T FOUND A SPOT YET.
I GUESS, TO BE MORE HONEST, I'D SAY I FOUND A FEW,
BUT AIN'T SETTLED ON ONE YET, ABSOLUTELY.
- I SEE.
- Sol:
EVERYONE DONE?
BECAUSEIFNOT,
- I FEAR FOR OUR LIVES.
- I'M DONE.
LET'S TAKE A NICE BRISK WALK.
SHIT.OH GOD.
DID I-
- DID I--
DID I SPILL ON ANYONE?
- NO.
- SORRY.
- WHERE Y'ALL HEADED?
- GONNA TAKE THE AIR.
JOIN US IF THE OPPORTUNITY PERMITS.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, CHARLIE.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.
YOU TOO, MISS STUBBS.
MADAM, AS CROWDED AS IT WAS YESTERDAY AND MORE SO TODAY,
IT SHOWS NO SIGN OF BECOMING LESS CROWDED.
YOU MIND GETTING YOUR ASS OUT OF MY SHOULDER?
YOU GOT A RUDE FUCKING MOUTH, FELLA.
CONDITIONS IN THAT DINING ROOM
HAVE GROWN INCREASINGLY OPPRESSIVE.
( inhales )
- IT'S CROWDED, FOR A FACT.
- PRICE OF THE CAMP'S SUCCESS.
THAT FELLA WAS BEING SMART WITH YOU, MERRICK.
YOUR ASS WAS NOWHERE NEAR HIS SHOULDER.
WELL, WHATEVER MY PROXIMITY, IT WAS CERTAINLY UNINTENTIONAL.
WELL, BELIEVE ME, I HAD THE ANGLE.
WE WAS JUST REMARKING HOW TIGHT IT'S ALL GETTING IN THERE.
AH, YET HOW MANY MEMORIES FOND TO THE RECOLLECTION
HAVE THEIR SETTING IN THAT TIGHT LITTLE DINING ROOM?
YEAH, WELL, IT'S FUCKED NOW.
ANYWAYS, WE OUGHT TO OPEN SOON.
WHO WOULD ARGUE THAT THE VENUE
WAS THE CAUSE OF THESE HAPPY MEMORIES, NOR THE BILL OF FARE?
THE BITTER COFFEE, THE RANCID BACON,
THOSE STALE BISCUITS
THAT WERE TOMB AND GRAVE TO SO MANY INSECTS.
NO, GENTLEMEN,
IT WAS THE MEANDERING CONVERSATION,
THE LINGERING WITH MEN OF CHARACTER,
SOME OF WHOM ARE WALKING WITH ME NOW,
THAT WAS SUCH PLEASURE TO EXPERIENCE
AND SUCH A JOY NOW TO RECALL.
GOOD OF YOU TO SAY, MR. MERRICK.
YEAH, BACK AT YA AS FAR AS THAT GOES.
YEAH.
GENTLEMEN, WHAT'S TO PREVENT US FROM FREEING OUR FRIENDSHIP
FROM DEPENDENCE ON THAT LITTLE DINING ROOM?
RELYING NOT ON HAPPENSTANCE AND APPETITE TO FURTHER
COMMERCE BETWEEN US, BUT ON OUR OWN CONSCIOUS CHOICE?
- MEANING WHAT?
- MEANING, MR. UTTER,
THE MOST INFORMAL AND DISORGANIZED
- OF CLUBS.
- WE GOTTA OPEN, SOL.
YEAH, I DON'T JOIN CLUBS.
NOW, NOW, ITS SOLE PURPOSE
COULD BE JUST WALKING TOGETHER AS WE ARE NOW.
WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST WALK TOGETHER
WHEN WE HAPPEN TO BE OUT?
WE COULD, OR WE COULD DEDICATE OURSELVES
TO THE PRINCIPLE OF WALKING TOGETHER.
MAYBE ALL WE NEED IS A NAME.
Bullock:
SOL?
WE GOTTA OPEN.
- YEAH, I GOT FREIGHT COMING IN.
- THIS WAS GOOD.
I ENJOYED THIS.
YEAH, WE'LL DO IT AGAIN.
- MORNING, MR. MERRICK.
- THANK YOU, MR. BULLOCK.
AND THANK YOU FOR THE LETTER TO THE EDITOR.
"THE AMBULATORS."
HUH.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, JIMMY?
SO FUCKING SICK, MR. SWEARENGEN.
- CHILLS, FEVER.
- YEAH, I HEAR IT STILL IN YOUR CHEST.
COUPLE TIMES, FELT LIKE TURNING MY FACE TO THE FUCKING WALL.
FUCKING PALE YOU ARE, TOO.
I-
- I'VE ROUNDED THE CORNER, THOUGH.
PLAN FOR MY RETURN TODAY OR TOMORROW.
WU'S OPIUM COURIER WAS ROBBED.
OH, IS THAT SO?
WELL, WAS IT MONEY THEY GOT OR DOPE?
ALL HIS FUCKING DOPE.
UH-OH.
- SO YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR RESUPPLY.
- NO.
- HAD YOU ANY LAID BY?
- NO, SIR.
"UH-OH," EH, JIMMY?
IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M IN FOR A DRY TIME.
( sighs )
SOME MORE ACHES AND PAINS COMING UP FOR ME.
WHEN WAS WU SUPPOSED TO HEAR AGAIN FROM CALIFORNIA?
CAN HE EVEN MAKE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD TO YOU?
I'M THAT AMAZED HOW THE FUCK YOU AND HIM
CAN MAKE YOURSELVES UNDERSTOOD ANY WAY TO EACH OTHER.
JIMMY, WHAT BECOME OF THAT DOPE-FIEND, FARO DEALER
THAT I HIRED TO APPRISE ME OF WHAT TRANSPIRED OVER AT TOLLIVER'S?
LEON?
LEON, THAT'S RIGHT.
JEEZ, HE JUST DISAPPEARED, DIDN'T HE?
WHERE THE FUCK HAS HE GOT TO?
YOU'VE BEEN WRONG SINCE YOU WALKED IN HERE.
YOU KNOW THAT, JIMMY, DON'T YOU?
LIKE I SAID, SIR, I FEEL LIKE HELL.
IS THAT WHAT I MEAN?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MR. SWEARENGEN?
YOU BEEN LYING, JIMMY.
SMELL OF CAT'S PISS IN THIS ROOM IS SO BAD,
I WANT TO BURN DOWN THE FUCKING BUILDING.
I'M NERVOUS, SIR.
I'M ALWAYS NERVOUS AROUND YOU.
NERVOUSNESS DON'T CAUSE THAT.
LYING CAUSES CAT PISS SMELL.
( sniffs, exhales deeply )
I WANT TO TEAR THIS ENTIRE FUCKING STRUCTURE DOWN.
I'LL STRANGLE YOU AND THROW YOU OFF THE BALCONY,
YOU STINKING LITTLE COCKSUCKER
IF YOU DON'T HURRY TO TELL ME
WHERE AND WHAT'S LEFT OF THAT FUCKING DOPE
THAT YOU AND THAT OTHER WEASEL HAVE BEEN SLAMMING
INTO YOUR DOPE-FIEND FUCKING VEINS DURING YOUR FUCKING CONVALESCENCE.
GOD, MR. SWEARENGEN--
JESUS, WHAT A FUCKING STINK!
NOT TO MENTION, YOU KILL A FUCKING CHINK COURIER
AND THE HEADACHE OVER THAT I'M GONNA HAVE WITH FUCKING WU
IF I EVER GET THIS FUCKING STENCH
- OUT OF MY FUCKING NOSTRILS.
- I JUST SHIT MYSELF, SIR.
I'M SAYING IT NOW BEFORE THE SMELL GETS YOU.
- YOU SHIT YOURSELF?
- I'M SORRY.
GO AHEAD, THROW YOURSELF OFF THE BALCONY.
I'M GONNA CRAWL, SIR, I SHOULDN'T STAND.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING DOPE?
AT LEON'S, I'LL SHOW YOU EXACTLY.
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.
WE WERE FOUR DAYS UP IN HIS ROOM.
HURRY THE FUCK UP.
GO ON, THROW YOURSELF.
AND STAY IN THE FUCKING MUCK UNTIL I'M DOWN THERE.
I JUST GOT A SPLINTER THE LENGTH OF MY ARM IN MY FUCKING PALM.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- GO.
GO, JIMMY.
COME ON.
COME ON, GET YOUR SHIT-SMEARED ASS OFF MY BALCONY.
GO, GO, GO!
( groans )
I HURT MY ARM.
BUT I'M OKAY.
YOU FUCKING LIE THERE NOW.
I'M JUST GONNA ROLL FORWARD,
SO-
- SO I DON'T GET TRAMPLED.
JIMMY IRONS IS IN THE MUCK.
DON'T LET HIM SCUTTLE OFF UNTIL DAN EMERGES WITH OTHER ORDERS.
HOW'D IT GO WITH JIMMY?
LYING THIEVING COCKSUCKER THREW HIMSELF OFF A BALCONY.
HE'LL LEAD YOU TO WHATEVER SHITHOLE
HIM AND THAT DOPE-FIEND FARO DEALER FROM TOLLIVER'S
HAVE BEEN USING TO SLAM WU'S JUNK INTO THEIR ARMS.
CHANGE IRONS INTO A PAIR OF THE OTHER COCKSUCKER'S TROUSERS
AND BRING 'EM BOTH BACK HERE, PLUS WHATEVER DOPE'S LEFT.
ALL RIGHT.
- IS THAT THE REVEREND IDLING BY THE PIANO?
- YES, SIR.
- HAS HE EXPLAINED HIS PRESENCE AT ALL?
- NO, SIR.
BUT HE AIN'T BEEN TRYING TO LEAD NO LOST SOULS TO THE LORD.
SO THERE'S THAT.
REVEREND.
MR. SWEARENGEN.
- YOUR NEW PIANO PLAYS WONDERFULLY.
- AIN'T IT DELIGHTFUL?
DAVE, GO GET A FREE TOUCH FROM WANDA, HUH?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR EYE?
I'M NOT CERTAIN.
SOMETHING'S BEEN AMISS THE LAST WEEK OR SO.
ANYWAYS, NOT WANTING TO GIVE OFFENSE,
WOULD YOU MIND ME ASKING YOU TO FREQUENT ANOTHER JOINT?
NO.NO, I UNDERSTAND.
MAN OF THE CLOTH SLOWS BUSINESS DOWN, HUH?
I UNDERSTAND, CERTAINLY.
HEY, WHAT-- WHAT'S THAT THEN, HMM?
SOMETHING AMISS WITH MY LEG, AS WELL.
HOW YOU DEALING WITH THE FITS, HUH?
NOTHING AMISS WITH THOSE.
THEY COME WITH SOME REGULARITY.
- MY BROTHER SUFFERED THEM.
- DID HE?
ANY CASE, DON'T TAKE ME FOR INHOSPITABLE.
OFF HOURS,
ANY PURPOSE YOU WANT TO VISIT, HMM, HMM?
INCOGNITO OR THE LIKE, I'LL BE HAPPY TO MAKE IT WORK.
I JUST HAPPENED TO HEAR THE PIANO.
ALL RIGHT, MINISTER.
ALL RIGHT, MR. SWEARENGEN.
FUCKING NEW PIANO.
- AFTERNOON.
- AFTERNOON.
AFTERNOON, HOSTETLER.
AFTERNOON.
NOW, I GOT OTHER INTERESTS IN MY PROPERTY.
IF'N YOU WANT IT, BETTER MAKE AN OFFER.
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE AN OFFER TODAY.
- HOW MUCH TIME WOULD YOU NEED?
- I DON'T KNOW.
I SAID WHEN I WAS READY, I'D BE BY TO YOU.
YOU DON'T WANT TO RUSH ME.
I WAS GIVING YOU FIRST OPPORTUNITY.
- NO ONE IS RUSHING YOU.
- ALL RIGHT.
FAIR OFFER FROM OTHER INTERESTS, I'M GONNA TAKE IT.
ALL RIGHT, HOSTETLER.
I'LL BE HAVING A PICKAXE.
BARGAIN AT $7.
( knocking )
IT'S OPEN.
- HI YA, KID.
- HI, EDDIE.
DID THAT BLOOD STAIN GET YOU THE SPECIAL RATE?
HAVE A SEAT, EDDIE.
I'D OFFER YOU A DRINK, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY BOOZE.
SETTLE ON A LOCATION FOR YOUR NEW PLACE YET?
I'M LOOKING.
GOOD.
- THAT'S A LIE.
- AS LONG AS IT'S THE ONLY ONE YOU EVER TOLD ME.
I DON'T WANT CY TO BACK ME,
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING WITHOUT HIM.
I'LL BACK YOU.
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY.
- I WILL.
- YOU GONNA TURN PROSPECTOR, EDDIE?
I'M GONNA ROB CY.
DON'T, EDDIE.
HE'LL KNOW.
WHAT'S THE TIME, KID?
NO, HE WON'T.
I DO BUSINESS WITH THIS FUCKING MAN.
WU DOES 50 FUCKING THINGS FOR ME.
YOU ROB HIS FUCKING COURIER AND KILL THE COCKSUCKER.
WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO WITH YOU, HUH?
I'M SO FUCKED UP, MR. SWEARENGEN.
I CAN'T MAKE A CASE FOR MYSELF.
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SAY?
FROM YOU, I HAVE RECEIVED NO SERVICE OF ANY KIND AT ANY POINT.
THAT CHAIR WOULD MAKE A BETTER SPY.
- ( groans )
- I'VE WORKED HARD FOR YOU, MR. SWEARENGEN.
- MY HABIT'S A FUCKIN' CURSE.
- OH GOD.
I WISH THE FUCK I NEVER TOOK UP OPIUM IN MY LIFE.
IF SOMETHING MIGHT PERSUADE YOU, MR. SWEARENGEN,
TO SAY YOU COULDN'T FIND US AND GIVE US A DAY'S START OUT OF CAMP...
YOU GOT ALMOST HALF THE DOPE BACK, MAYBE A LITTLE LESS.
SO I GIVE HIM A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF THE DOPE,
WHICH YOU BEING THE CAT PISS STINKING LIARS YOU ARE,
HE'LL PROBABLY DRAW A PICTURE EXPLAINING TO ME IS 10% OF THE DOPE.
AND THEN I'LL PROBABLY DRAW A PICTURE FOR HIM, PORTRAYING MYSELF A CUNT!
'CAUSE IN THAT CHINK MIND OF HIS,
I'M SUPPOSED TO BRING YOU TO HIM FOR HIS PIG'S FUCKING SUPPER.
PLEASE FUCKING GOD, MR. SWEARENGEN,
- DON'T GIVE US TO WU FOR HIS PIGS.
- ( gags )
( Leon coughing )
( door closes )
( speaking Chinese )
WE'RE HERE TO BE OVERCHARGED ON SOME FUCKING MEAT.
WILL YOUR CHINK HIGHNESS FUCKING PERMIT US TO GO INSIDE
AND GET ROBBED BLIND ON A SIDE OF ELK?
I FOUND THE COCKSUCKERS THAT STOLE YOUR DOPE
AND THAT'S WHAT'S LEFT OF THE FUCKING SHIPMENT.
COCKSUCKERS!
OH YEAH, I'M ALL FUCKING FOR IT, WU.
BUT NEITHER OF US WOULD HAVE REACHED
OUR PRESENT COMFORTABLE POSITION FREEZING OUR BALLS OFF
IF WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU CAN'T CUT THE THROAT
OF EVERY COCKSUCKER WHOSE CHARACTER IT WOULD IMPROVE.
COCKSUCKER.
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE WHITE COCKSUCKERS' THROATS
HAVE BEEN CUT AND TWO DOZEN MORE WHITE COCKSUCKERS
GET THEIR LOADS ON AND DECIDE TO TEACH YOU
AND ALL YOUR CHINK FRIENDS A FUCKING LESSON?
WHO'S GONNA WALK AWAY FROM THAT GET-TOGETHER, HUH, WU?
COCKSUCKER!
YEAH.
COCKSUCKER.
SWE'GEN BRING YOU COCKSUCKER.
( sighs )
- SWE'GEN.
- BUT ONLY ONE, WU.
ONE COCKSUCKER, NOT TWO.
COCKSUCKER.
ONE.
NO TWO.
I GIVE UP TWO WHITES FOR ONE CHINK,
WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED STRINGING YOU UP, THEY'LL COME GET ME.
HOW MUCH?
SWE'GEN.
EVEN MONEY THIS'LL END UP A FUCKING BLOODBATH.
EVERY FUCKING TIME I COME WITH ONE PRICE IN MIND
AND LEAVE HAVING PAID IN DOUBLE.
HOW DOES THIS WU DO IT TO ME, HUH?
Dan:
THINK THESE CHINKS UNDERSTAND YOU?
THEY UNDERSTAND MY FUCKING ATTITUDE.
THAT HE'S A FUCKING WILY BIG SHOT.
BUILDS HIM UP AMONGST HIS PEOPLE.
TAKE THEM TWO DOPE-FIENDS OVER TO THE BATHS
WHILE I CONVERSE WITH TOLLIVER OVER WHICH ONE GETS MURDERED.
IT'S A NICE PIECE OF MEAT.
SO CUT A PIECE OFF FOR YOURSELF,
PUT THE REST IN THE CELLAR, THEN TAKE THEM HOOPLE HEADS TO THE BATH.
NICE MEAT!
( speaking Chinese )
IF IT'S YOUR MISSING FARO DEALER YOU'RE DRINKING OVER,
- HE JUST THREW UP IN MY OFFICE.
- ( snickers )
HAD YOU BEEN SHARING SPACE WITH HIM A WHILE?
ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO FIND OUT
HIM AND A FELLOW DOPE-FIEND WHO WORKS FOR ME
- ROBBED AND MURDERED A CHINK OPIUM COURIER.
- ( groans )
LEON, LEON, LEON.
SECOND BEST THIMBLE RIGGER I EVER SAW WHEN HE WASN'T CHASING THE DRAGON.
YOU DO REALIZE I'M PRESENTING YOU WITH A MUTUAL PROBLEM.
WHICH I EXPECT'S A LITTLE WAYS DOWN THE ROAD, SO I'M WAXING PHILOSOPHICAL
TILL YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.
I MADE A DEAL WITH THE BOSS CHINK
- TO GIVE HIM ONE OF THE TWO DOPE-FIENDS.
- OH.
DO I ASSUME SOME PIECE OF THE OPIUM
THIS COURIER BORE WAS INTENDED FOR YOU?
AH, SO YOU GOT A REASON TO KEEP THE CHINK BOSS HAPPY.
I DON'T, SO I CAN STAND ON PRINCIPLE.
WHAT'S YOUR FUCKING PRINCIPLE?
A WHITE DOPE-FIEND'S STILL WHITE.
I DON'T DELIVER WHITE MEN TO CHINKS--
LEAVING ME WITH A BAG OF SHIT TO HOLD.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK HARDER ABOUT TRAFFICKING IN FUCKING JUNK.
I'M A PURVEYOR OF SPIRITS, CY, DOPE FUCKING INCLUDED,
AND WHEN CHANCE AFFORDS, A THIEF, BUT I AIN'T NO FUCKING HYPOCRITE.
( sighs ) I THINK WE'RE DONE, AL.
BUT IN MY LINE, I'M USED TO CERTAIN TYPES
THINKING THEY NEED THE LAST WORD.
NO, MY LAST WORD IS THE FUCKING BAGMAN'S HERE FROM YANKTON,
SO GET UP YOUR FUCKING SHARE.
WHERE'S FUCKING JOANIE STAYING?
I DON'T KNOW, CY.
AH, DON'T FUCKING LIE TO ME.
- I DON'T KNOW.
- ( clicks tongue )
IF YOU SEE HER AT WHATEVER FUCKING PLACE
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE'S STAYING AT,
TELL HER I HAVE SOME GOOD FUCKING NEWS FOR HER
ABOUT UPCOMING REAL ESTATE AVAILABILITIES
IF SHE'D EVER SHOW UP TO HEAR ABOUT IT.
- OKAY?
- SURE, BOSS.
- THANK YOU.
- ( piano playing )
THAT AIN'T RIGHT, SEE?
MY FATHER WAS A PREACHER OF THE WORD
AND THAT AIN'T RIGHT.
( women giggling )
SO THIS WHAT IT'S COME TO IN DEADWOOD, EH, DOC?
MINISTERS KICKING UP THEIR HEELS
AND CHINAMEN WALKING THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR?
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GIGGLE, YOU LEAK PISS.
- POOR FUCKING MAN.
- LET ME SEE YOUR ARM.
IT'S FINE, DOC, IT'S BETTER.
QUIT ACTING LIKE A GODDAMN FOOL AND SIT DOWN.
GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM HIM!
SHUT THAT FUCKING PIANO DOWN!
HEY, BIG TIME, FUCK 'EM OR GET THE FUCK OUT!
DID WE NOT COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING?
IN WHAT CONNECTION, SIR?
IN THE CONNECTION OF YOU STAYING THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
I DON'T RECALL THAT, SIR.
- DO YOU WISH ME TO LEAVE?
- YEAH, I WISH YOU TO FUCKING LEAVE.
WRITE YOURSELF A NOTE AND HANG IT OVER YOUR ONE GOOD FUCKING EYE:
- "STAY OUT OF AL SWEARENGEN'S JOINT."
- ALL RIGHT, SIR.
"STAY THE FUCK OUT OF THE GEM, WHATEVER MY FUCKING PROBLEM IS," HMM?
I WAS DRAWN TO THE MUSIC.
THE PIANO RELIEVES MY HEADACHE.
LISTEN TO A PIANO WHERE YOU DON'T MAKE A FUCKING ASS OUT OF YOURSELF, HUH?
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE I MIGHT FIND ONE?
- NO!
HELP HIM THE FUCK OUT, HUH?
COME ON.
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?
HE'S HAVING CHANGES IN HIS BRAIN.
I HOPE TO CHRIST HE'S HAVING CHANGES.
I'D HATE TO THINK OF HIM CONDUCTING PERFORMANCES LIKE THAT
OF SECRET EVENINGS IN THE FOREST AND THE LIKE.
I'M CERTAIN NOW IT'S A TUMOR.
- THAT CAUSED THE FITS TOO, HUH?
- YES.
YOU NOTICE NOW TOO HE'S STARING COCKEYED?
HE WAS IN HERE NOT TWO HOURS AGO.
DON'T FUCKING REMEMBER.
- NOTHING TO BE DONE, HUH?
- NO.
HE AIN'T COMING BACK IN MY JOINT.
HE'S A MAN OF THE CLOTH IN CASE HE FORGETS.
KICKING UP HIS LEGS LIKE A FOUR-BIT STRUMPET.
HOW'S TRIXIE'S SPIRITS SEEM TO YOU, HUH?
- HER ABSCESS SEEMS FINE.
- THAT AIN'T WHAT I ASKED!
AND I DON'T ANSWER FOR THE STATE OF PEOPLE'S SPIRITS.
COME ON!
BUY A DRINK!
GET YOUR PRICKS SUCKED!
SPEND SOME FUCKING MONEY, HUH?
!
IT AIN'T CIRCUMSTANCE.
IT'S MY OWN FUCKING METTLESOME NATURE.
- FAR AS WHAT?
- WHAT I'VE DONE, SOL.
AND YOU HAVE TO ADMIRE ME FOR IT.
IT'S MOVED 300 MILES TO SET THE DAMN SITUATION UP
I LEFT MONTANA TO GET AWAY FROM.
- DRAWING UP PROPOSALS FOR REFUSE DISPOSAL.
- UNSOLICITED.
INSULTED HOSTETLER OUT OF MY OWN FUCKING IRRITABILITY.
I BELIEVE HOSTETLER'S HAD WORSE AFTERNOONS.
WIFE AND CHILD I BARELY KNOW.
I DON'T GUESS YOU NEED ME TO SAY IT.
IF THERE'S A HEAVEN, YOUR BROTHER SEES WHAT YOU DID AND HE'S GRATEFUL.
MAYBE HE SEES ME BORROWING HIS LIFE
SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO LIVE MY OWN.
PEOPLE HAVE MADE GOOD LIVES OUT OF BORROWED ONES BEFORE.
BUT SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
THEM STUFFED ENVELOPES FOR THOSE CUNTS AT THE LEGISLATURE,
PAST SMOOTHING THE ROAD FOR THE CAMP'S ANNEXATION,
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO CLEAR UP A PERSONAL SITUATION.
BUT THAT LETTER YOU BORE FROM THE MAGISTRATE
EXPLAINED MY SITUATION WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL ENVELOPES.
NOT MY PROBLEM.
BUT YOU'D UNDERSTAND HOW A MAN WOULD FEEL AGGRIEVED,
LEARNING THAT HE BRIBED A LEGISLATOR TO ANNEX A CAMP,
BUT HADN'T GOT THE SOLD-OUT COCKSUCKERS
TO LIFT THE MURDER WARRANT AGAINST HIM?
HOW HE'D FEEL THAT HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME,
AND TROUBLE AND EXPENSE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF GETTING HANGED?
NOT SO FAR I'D EXCUSE HIM MOTHERFUCKING ME
THAT ONLY BORE THE MESSAGE.
NO.
I'M HERE TO TAKE YOUR MESSAGE BACK TO THE MAGISTRATE.
WHO I'D BE SURPRISED IS A LYING, THIEVING DOUBLE-CROSSING COCKSUCKER
ONLY IN HIS DEALINGS WITH ME.
YEAH.
- MAGISTRATE CLAGETT IS A COCKSUCKER.
- AND?
MAKE YOUR OFFER.
HOW CAN YOU PROVE YOU'RE NOT HERE TO CATCH ME IN A SWITCH?
I'M NOT HERE TO PROVE SHIT TO YOU.
DOES IT MATTER TO YOU THE COCKSUCKER THE WARRANT'S OUT ON ME FOR KILLING
NEEDED MURDERING EVERY FUCKING DAY HE DREW BREATH?
- NO.
- GOOD.
GOTTA GO TO THE BATHHOUSE.
YOU WANT TO ACCOMPANY ME?
NO ONE'S LOOKING TO FUCK YOU UP THE ASS.
I GOTTA EXECUTE SOMEONE.
HERE'S THE SITUATION:
TWO DOPE-FIENDS ROB AND MURDER AN OPIUM COURIER.
DOPE-FIENDS ARE WHITE, OPIUM COURIER'S A CHINK.
SO FAR, WHO CARES?
THE CHINK WHO PAID FOR THE DELIVERY
IS A BOSS AMONGST HIS OWN, GOES BERSERK.
MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE STILL, HUH?
SOME OF THE DOPE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELIVERED
BY THE BOSS CHINK TO A PILLAR OF THE WHITE COMMUNITY,
A WONDERFUL MAN.
ONE OF THE DOPE-FIENDS WORKS FOR HIM.
THE OTHER ONE WORKS FOR A CLEVER COCKSUCKER
WHO COULD BE CONSIDERED HIS RIVAL,
AND WHO IS WATCHING US FROM HIS BALCONY EVEN AS WE SPEAK.
THANK YOU FOR NOT LOOKING.
THE BOSS CHINK WANTS TO FEED
BOTH THE DOPE-FIENDS TO HIS PIGS.
NO.
WOULD YOU GIVE HIM ONE?
IS THE BOSS CHINK THE ONLY SOURCE OF OPIUM IN THE CAMP?
YUP.
ANY OTHER BUSINESS CONNECTIONS WITH THE WHITE PILLAR?
SEVERAL.
I'D GIVE HIM ONE.
LET THE DOPE-FIENDS DRAW FUCKING STRAWS.
CLEVER COCKSUCKER WON'T CONSENT TO THAT.
DON'T WANT HIS MAN IN A LOTTERY
THAT COULD DELIVER HIM TO A CHINK.
IS THE CLEVER COCKSUCKER SPOILING FOR A FIGHT?
Cy:
AL.
WHAT YOU ASKED FOR EARLIER...
I SUSPECT THAT'S WHO IT'S INTENDED FOR.
SMART THINKING.
THIS IS LILAH.
SAY HELLO TO THE FELLAS, LILAH.
HELLO, FELLAS.
SPEAKS, TOO.
BE A BIG EARNER FOR YOU, CY.
- MAYBE HE IS SPOILING FOR A FIGHT.
- FELT THAT WAY TO ME.
NO ONE ASKED YOU HOW IT FELT.
MY MONEY'D BE ON HIM TRYING TO PUT THE CHINK BOSS
IN THE WRONG IN THE EYES OF THE CAMP.
ANYWAYS, THANK GOD I DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON YOU
TO FORMULATE MY PLAN OF ACTION.
YOU WITH ME?
YEAH, I'M WITH YOU.
MR. SWEARENGEN.
AL, WE ARE GOOD AND FUCKED UP.
WE ARE FUCKED UP, MR. SWEARENGEN.
- WHAT HAVE WE BEEN SAYING REPEATEDLY, DAN?
- AL'S A GOOD GUY.
THAT YOU'D FUCKING ALLOW US OUR WORKS HERE
AND US PERIODICALLY FIXING THE ENTIRE TIME
WE'RE IN THE FUCKING TUB,
AFTER HOW WE INCONVENIENCED YOU AND FUCKED YOU UP.
FUCKED UP OUR OWN FUCKING LIVES
FROM THE TIME I WAS A FUCKING CHILD.
AL.
THANK YOU, MR. SWEARENGEN, AND YOU ARE A GOOD GUY.
THANK YOU, AL.
ONE OF YOU IS GONNA HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO WU.
- APOLOGIZE?
- Leon:
I'LL APOLOGIZE.
BRING THAT SLANT-EYED BASTARD OVER HERE.
HE CAN GET IN THE FUCKING TUB WITH ME.
I'LL APOLOGIZE
AND THEN I'LL KISS HIM.
AND THEN I'LL TIE HIM OFF AND I'LL SHOOT HIM UP
AND THEN I'LL BLOW HIM
WITH FUCKING SOAP.
WE'RE GONNA DRAW STRAWS...
TO SEE WHO GOES OVER TO SEE WU.
WE GO THERE?
I WITHDRAW MY VOLUNTEER.
I AM COMFORTABLE WHERE I AM.
YOU'RE GONNA PICK A STRAW, JIMMY.
WELL, WHEN YOU SAY APOLOGIZE, SIR,
COULD YOU BE SPECIFIC WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?
SHORT STRAW APOLOGIZES.
BUT THEN WHAT THE FUCK IS WU GONNA DO?
I WORKED IT OUT WITH WU.
YOU DON'T THINK I'D BE HERE UNLESS I'D WORKED IT OUT WITH WU.
SO AN APOLOGY'S GONNA BE ENOUGH?
WE HAPPEN TO BE FUCKING WHITE.
IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED,
HE HAPPENS TO BE A FUCKING SLANT-EYED FUCKING CELESTIAL.
HE'S LUCKY TO GET A FUCKING APOLOGY.
HE'S LUCKY WE'RE WILLING TO DO EVEN THAT.
- WELL, WHY DO I GOTTA PICK?
- I'LL PICK.
I DON'T FUCKING MIND.
DON'T BE FUCKING AFRAID.
YOU BE AFRAID YOUR WHOLE LIFE OF EVERY FUCKING THING.
YOU WANT ME TO PICK, AL?
I'LL PICK.
AND THEN I'LL BLOW MYSELF WITH FUCKING SOAP.
PICK, JIMMY.
SHOW ME.
UH, WOULD YOU SHOW ME THE STRAWS, PLEASE, SIR?
SO I KNOW ONE'S LONG AND ONE'S SHORT.
PICK.
CAN I GET OFF AGAIN FIRST?
IS THAT THE SHORT ONE OR THE LONG ONE?
DO NOT THROW UP.
I DON'T WANT TO SMELL YOUR STINK!
- REVEREND SMITH.
- EVENING, SIR.
- EVENING.
- REVEREND.
I WATCHED GOODS IN THE TENT THIS UH,
THIS STRUCTURE REPLACED WHILE MESSIEURS...
BULLOCK AND STAR FIRST TOOK IN THE CAMP.
YOU SURE DID.
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU, REVEREND?
I'M IN A QUANDARY, GENTLEMEN.
ARE YOU MESSIEURS BULLOCK AND STAR?
IN THE FLESH.
YOU ARE THE ABSOLUTE IMAGES OF THEM, GENTLEMEN.
BUT WHAT MAKES ME AFRAID IS I DO NOT RECOGNIZE YOU AS MY FRIENDS.
AND NATURALLY, I AM AFRAID.
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF, SIR?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.
I HAVE VARIOUS AILMENTS,
AND I SUPPOSE THIS IS A FURTHER AILMENT,
BUT OF WHAT SORT, I DON'T KNOW.
AND I'M AFRAID IF YOU ARE DEVILS,
WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU ARE,
BECAUSE YOU WERE THE KINDEST MEN OF ALL IN THE CAMP TO ME--
BUT IF YOU WERE DEVILS, I SUPPOSE THAT--
THAT WOULD BE THE TYPE OF SHAPE YOU WOULD TAKE,
AND-
- AND IF YOU ARE NOT DEVILS, I--
THEN I AM--
I AM SIMPLY LOSING MY MIND.
AND WITH MY OTHER AILMENTS,
I AM CONCERNED AND AFRAID.
ALL RIGHT, REVEREND.
WE'RE THE PEOPLE YOU MET THE NIGHT YOU WATCHED OUR GOODS.
I'M FROM ETOBICOKE, ONTARIO.
I'M FROM VIENNA, AUSTRIA.
WONDERFUL.
YOU'RE HERE WITH FRIENDS.
YES, YES, I FEEL THAT NOW.
AND I HAVE VARIOUS AILMENTS
OF WHICH WE ALL SUFFER.
AND NEXT MORNING OFTEN FINDS US FEELING BETTER.
YES.
IN ANY CASE, PART OF GOD'S PLAN.
MAY WE WALK YOU BACK TO YOUR TENT, SIR?
AN EVENING STROLL WITH FRIENDS.
I WOULD SO ENJOY THAT.
LET'S GO THEN.
Reverend:
MR. SWEARENGEN'S SALOON HAS A NEW PIANO.
( locks door )
YOU TELL YOUR BOSS.
TELL HIM WHAT YOU SAW HERE, HUH?
( panting ) I SAW A FAIR PROCEDURE.
I SAW A FAIR PROCEDURE, AL, TO TELL MR. TOLLIVER.
( groaning ) OH GOD!
DO NOT FUCKING CALL ME AL.
( sobbing )
I GUESS TOLLIVER ACHIEVED HIS PURPOSE STANDING ON THAT BALCONY.
- WHY'D YOU KILL YOUR OWN GUY?
- WHY?
YOU GIVE TOLLIVER'S DOPE-FIEND TO THE BOSS CHINK INSTEAD OF YOUR OWN GUY,
GIVES TOLLIVER THE OPENING TO MAKE THE BOSS CHINK
LOOK WRONG IN THE EYES OF THE WHITES.
AND HE CAN GO TO WAR WITH ME AND MAKE ME OUT A CHINK LOVER.
WHAT IF MY GUY HAD DRAWN THE LONG STRAW?
I GUESS HE'D HAVE BEEN SHIT OUT OF LUCK.
MR. ADAMS, DON'T THINK THERE WAS A LONG STRAW.
MR. ADAMS, MR. DORITY.
- SILAS.
- DAN.
SILAS, LIFT YOUR LID.
YEAH.
GET A FUCKING HAIRCUT.
LOOKS LIKE YOUR MOTHER FUCKED A MONKEY.
WU, HERE'S THAT COCKSUCKER TO APOLOGIZE.
SAY YOU'RE SORRY, JIMMY.
( pigs grunting )
SWE'GEN.
YEAH.
SWE'GEN HOPES WE AIN'T SIGNED OURSELVES UP FOR KILLING TOO.

That's what McCall was ridin'.
All right.
Charlie:
Evening.
Evening back.
Look at that paint, Charlie.
I seen it.
I had a happy just like that.
Foundered.
- Makes me miserable reminiscing on it.
- Do you know the owner?
If he'd sell the horse is what he really wants to know.
Well, I don't know if he'd sell.
But the fuckin' jerk's in that bunkhouse.
- Thank you.
- Evenin'.
(chattering)
Jack McCall.
I'm done.
I don't wanna play no more.
Bein' a loudmouth cunt,
I guess some time since he's been here, this fella who don't wanna play no more probably spoke of killin' Wild Bill Hickok.
Well, we're Bill Hickok's friends.
- I'm Seth Bullock.
- I'm Charlie Utter.
And if you got your head blown off sitting' here with your back turned, that'd be as fair a play as you gave him.
Guess you wanna soften him up some before you make your offer?
My plan is to take him to Yankton for trial.
If you got a different idea, you can ride ahead.
Nah.
Let's take the cocksucker to Yankton.
I don't know of a Henry Anderson in camp, but that don't mean there ain't.
This was took of him in the Union army.
He'd be 12 years older now.
Could you let her hold it?
With so much showing, it's pretty near falling' apart.
Here.
Third from the middle.
That, uh... right there?
- Yeah.
- That face don't-- don't look familiar.
Thanks for lookin'.
You definite he's in these hills?
Wrote from Bismarck, said he'd send for us when he got set up.
Man:
I just gotta say it's no guarantee your dad's anywhere near this area.
And there's no fuckin' joy in me telling you that, but it's the goddamned truth and the way human beings are.
- He said he'd send for Mother and us.
- Is your mama here?
She passed.
Sorry.
Well, good luck.
Do you know of-- of work for me?
- No.
- She can get work right here.
- Boy:
No, sir.
- Girl:
No, thank you.
- Can you push a broom?
- And I could start now.
Four bits a day.
And I'd bet you'd like the first in advance.
If you wouldn't mind.
Same for her, as regrets for me being such a ruffian.
Here you go, honey.
If I don't fire him first, you can pick him up at 10:00.
Thank you, sir.
I'll wait for you, Miles.
Find a safe place to wait, you hear?
We teach a special sweeping' technique here.
Follow her lead.
(man coughing)
It's all right, son.
It's all right.
Um... excuse me.
I'm required to be at the graveyard.
The widow Garret is laying her husband to rest.
I'd have bet a month's wages that burial would've took place in New York City, if I had a fuckin' payin' job.
The, uh... wet cloth to his lips seems to give him some relief.
- All right.
- Thank you.
What do you think of my patient, Doc?
You might wanna steer clear of his reflection for a while, but you're symptom-free.
You ain't contagious no more and you can't get re-infected, so--
Them as heals under my care stay fuckin' healed.
- Thanks, Doc.
- I got clothes for you back here.
Hereafter in calamity, I'll be sure to call for Jane.
(chuckles) You gonna stick around the camp?
- I believe I will for a while.
- Good, 'cause I wanna monitor your activities, find out what you do that weighs so heavy on your conscience.
When I first come on you in the woods, all you could say was, "I apologize."
Before you exhibit your johnson, I'm gonna see to this fella.
So long.
Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you.
- All right.
- You're on your own for alterations.
- Hmm.
Now I'm gonna lay this cloth on your fuckin' lips.
Trixie:
There's Mr. Star to collect us.
Mr. Star has been ever so attentive.
- Very considerate.
- To you.
When we leave the hotel, my boss will be watchin'.
Shall I reel and stagger?
I...
I know the risk lying to him has put you to.
I've-
- I can't imagine why I'd make it the subject of humor.
- You're feeling better.
- (knock on door)
- Am I early?
- Good morning, Mr. Star.
I'll be ready in just a moment.
- I can have a cup of coffee downstairs.
- No, not at all.
Wait.
Wait in here with Trixie.
I'll just be a moment.
That widow ain't high.
Maybe waiting till after the service.
When she'd wanna get good and fucking loaded is before the fucking service, against all the fucking carrying on.
- What do you think?
- Makes sense.
Meaning all that whore's been telling me the last 10 fucking days about seeing the widow taking the dope, and your own fucking assurances-- you verify that she's loaded personally-- you're both full of shit.
I checked in on the woman daily.
If I was fooled, perhaps I've chosen simplemindedness, Al, over realizing a certain friend has used me as an instrument of purposes he concealed.
Say what you're gonna say or prepare for eternal fucking silence.
I don't believe you commissioned me to make an offer on the widow's claim to keep the regulators off you, Al.
I think someone found something out there you want.
Assume you ain't been privy to the ins and outs of that matter for the sake of fucking conversation, huh?
I mean, was I asleep, EB, when you and me declared undying loyalty and full-faith mutual disclosure about every fucking detail of every fucking move we were
- ever gonna fucking make together?
- You used me as a pawn, Al.
And you fucked up the game is the central fucking present issue.
We agreed on 2,000.
You want a fucking percentage instead?
Is that such an inconceivable proposition?
- Yeah, you got a percentage, EB.
- How big?
Two percent of the first million, half a percent after.
You wanna feel a damp palm, Al, select either of these hands.
Just get to the funeral, EB.
Go to 20 if you have to.
Just get that fucking claim.
20 if I have to.
My word.
What a handsome man.
Wish I could tell you I recognize him.
Thank you anyway.
- Your dad, I expect.
- Yes.
You have reason to think he's out here?
He wrote us from Bismarck he'd be prospecting the hills.
- "Us" being?
- My brother.
He just got work over here.
Good for him.
So it's just the two of you?
Our mother passed.
Why we come from Buffalo.
- And you're out here looking for your dad.
- Yes.
- Uh, Henry?
- Yes.
Out here looking for her father, Eddie-- her and her older brother.
Got a photograph, I don't...
I don't recognize the likeness.
No.
- Henry Anderson?
- Yes.
- Yeah, I don't recognize him.
- Mm.
What are you gonna do while your brother works?
Work too, while we're looking to set aside, if we have to move on.
Oh, if Dad doesn't turn up here.
Yeah, what do you do?
Cook, clean, sew, sweep.
Uh-huh.
- How quick do you learn?
- Guess I learn pretty quick.
Maestro.
We are strangers and sojourners.
Mr. Garret's burial place is a great distance from New York City.
But his home
- is in His Father's house.
- Ingrid...
Marta...
- And on the great day...
- ...
Mama...
- His Father will take him into it.
- ...
Papa.
As He will all who confess His Son savior from wherever we may be put to rest.

I hope you ain't gived up on that little runt of a girl, Al.
Oh, do you worry for her, Dan, wandering the muck of our thoroughfare, her tiny self all but swallowed up in horseshit?
Hey, kid!
Come here.
- Yes, sir?
- Stand with us here a second.
What are-- what are we doing?
Waiting.
Al:
And out the door he'll go, and prompt as a Swiss fucking timepiece three big-tittied whores will now emerge from behind that screen.
He lines 'em up at two-foot intervals, smock tops down, and all but sprints past 'em, giving their titties a lick.
And if he misses a titty, does not let himself retrace his steps.
- Don't tell me.
- Yeah, and then he goes on his way home, relieved for the day.
What's your name?
It's Miles, huh?
- Miles, yeah.
- Yeah.
Strange, huh, Miles?
But something you gotta know about specialists:
they pay a premium and they never cause fucking trouble.
I sometimes imagine in my declining years running a small joint in Manchester, England, catering to specialists exclusive.
And to let 'em know they're amongst their own, I'll operate from the corner, hanging upside down like a fucking bat, hmm?
- We're not bad sorts here, huh, Miles?
- No, sir.
So do you wanna ask your sister if she'd like to reconsider, hmm?
You don't really mean that, Mr. Swearengen.
Of course I don't mean it.
How dare you suggest I'd mean a thing like that, huh?
I did my part-- raised our offer to 20 and demanded answer within the day.
But what, you cocksucker?
Complications have ensued:
Bullock's come back.
I expect she'll wanna take counsel with him.
Tell the whore I wanna see her.
And I trust this doesn't alter our agreement.
I trust you know 2% of nothing's fucking nothing.
That fella from Montana I knew to trust won't be able to assay your claim.
I see.
We'll engage someone local, and I'll keep an eye on him.
As I've decided to stay in camp, Mr. Bullock, at least for the near term,
I hope you'll feel absolved of those responsibilities towards my interest that you undertook at Mr. Hickok's request.
I prefer to see 'em through.
They're properly mine.
I even feel marginally capable of shouldering them and I certainly realize that you and Mr. Star have responsibilities of your own.
Are you firing me, Mrs. Garret?
I'm offering you absolution.
Otherwise I'm staying on.
I'm so sorry you were hurt.
So how hard are they coming at you to sell?
I could confide that in an effort to blur my judgment,
Mr. Swearengen engaged intermediaries to indulge me with opium.
But that would entail acknowledging that
I've had a weakness in that direction.
Uh... more appropriately, uh, I could add at the graveyard Mr. Farnum raised his offer
$7,500, presumably also on Mr. Swearengen's instruction, and set a 24-hour limit to my reply.
Under the circumstances, I'd say that's coming pretty hard.
Please forgive me for making you uncomfortable, Mr. Bullock.
I had better manners before I began to abstain.
That's all right.
Anyways, are you at risk for the smallpox?
I was inoculated in New York City.
The child whose life you saved presumably has not been, but I assume she's safer under my care than traveling in a covered wagon with strangers.
Anyways, I'll line up the assayer.
Thank you.
You are changed.
You seem to be too.
Our stock's depleted, but we are offering a 100% discount on any item that catches your eye.
I've got money.
Our special get- acquainted-with-those- we'd-like-to-get- acquainted-with sale.
Mr. Utter.
I brought these pickaxes for you to sell.
There's two sifters on that black cayuse out there.
Mighty grateful, sir.
You got this place just about built, don't you?
Saving the last master-strokes for Seth.
Oh, hello.
I didn't see you.
Hello.
Hey, that's that little girl, isn't it?
Taking care of her for Mrs. Garret.
As much as she favors you, she could be yours.
I lost the receipts for my costs.
Maybe while you was busy saving my partner's life.
Let me get these sifters for you.
See if you can make those accounts add up.
I don't know if you heard me inside thanking you for helping my friend.
I heard you.
It's all right.
I'm sorry you lost yours.
All right.
Thank you.
Welcome back, Mr. Utter.
We've had a mild increase in rates, but I do have a room available.
I'll see.
What do you want, Mr. Farnum?
I have a message for Trixie that's looking to that orphan child.
- She's to see her longer-term employer.
- I'll tell her.
You know who that is?
I know she works at The Gem.
And even so, admit her to your trade at public hours-- congratulations, sir, on your advanced thinking.
Al wants you, Trixie.
Stickler for self-delivered messages.
Our dad ain't here.
I know it, even if my brother don't.
Maybe he never even tried to get here.
Or maybe he did try to get here and couldn't, maybe something happened to him.
There's so many ways it could be, Flora, it's not much point deciding which it was.
He'd never think that though-- my brother.
Must be how he needs to do.
I ain't a virgin-- if you wanna know that.
I had a boyfriend in Buffalo.
And was you upset to have to leave him?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
I was upset.
At the same time he was a stupid son of a bitch.
And rough.
Here.
You can't tell my brother about him.
He'd make it back to Buffalo and shoot Lewis in the head.
All that way in defense of your virtue?
That's more trouble than I ever took with it.
Cy.
Lazarus risen.
Look at you, you son of a gun.
Hello, Cy.
Good to see you, Andy.
Don't be afraid to shake with me, Eddie.
I ain't contagious no more.
Highly becoming outfit.
I'm here for my belongings.
Look... they're gone, Andy.
Measures to stop the spread.
Ah hell, the important thing is you're well.
I'll front you whatever you need.
Let's get something going, hmm?
- Andy?
- In the flesh, sweetheart.
- Which ain't much to look at.
- You made it, Andy.
Oh, and we ain't getting nothing going.
All I come back for, Cy, was my things, and you tossed them too.
Why don't you take this and get yourself outta that clown outfit?
Once you've cooled off a little, think how you'd have done different when somebody showed up in the shape you was in and my responsibilities to meet.
Better than to throw him in the woods to fucking die?
Then don't think about nothing, Andy.
Use the money for a whore and a toot and go join the fucking circus.
Did you turn her out?
Her brother's gonna be a problem.
Fuck her brother.
We'll handle the brother if we have to kill the cocksucker.
That's an interesting piece of strange.
(knocks)
Ain't you a picture?
- What is it?
- Hmm?
Oh, am I detaining you in some way?
Am I fucking imposing?
Mrs. Garret's to sit down with Bullock.
I thought you'd want me over there.
Oh yeah, so you can bring me a full and fair report, huh?
But will the widow have her wits about her, Trixie, huh?
Or will they be passing the opium pipe like heathens between 'em, her and fucking Bullock, hmm?
- What're you pissed off for?
- I ain't pissed off.
I'm in fucking wonderment.
I'm waiting to be kept happy by the next fucking fairy tale.
Do you want me back at the hotel or do you wanna do something to me?
Now why would I want you to go back there, huh?
Or rely on anything you said transpired after you lied about her taking that dope, huh?
Her being high... wasn't gonna have nothing to do with whether or not she sold you that claim, and she wanted to get off the dope.
And that little one needs someone to care for her... and maybe get her the fuck outta here.
And I knew it wasn't gonna be me.
So you want me back over there and to tell you what they fucking decide?
Or do you wanna rip my fucking guts out?
Get back there quick.
Don't kid yourself, Trixie.
Don't get a mistaken idea.
Mr. Utter.
This is where Bill got killed, huh?
Uh...
I'll be sorry about that for as long as I live.
Can you tell me about it?
Yeah.
It-- it was about sun-up over at that Bella Union joint,
Mr. Hickok plum gutted McCall at draw.
And now here Mr. Hickok was at poker again.
Say a couple hours of daylight left and in come that coward McCall.
Walked up on him and shot him in the head.
Bill never know when he come in.
Uh, those of us that did, we didn't have no inkling of what he intended.
He just murdered him, right where he sat.
Man:
If I may, sir... this is here where
Wild Bill was sitting when McCall entered from the front, approached the table, causing no apprehension 'cause he had often frequented the game.
Of a sudden, McCall produced a revolver and shouting "Take that, damn you!" he fired.
Muzzle couldn't have been three inches from Wild Bill's head.
Now I'm told that Hickok fell dead immediately, but I won't testify to it, because the bullet, after it passed through Wild Bill's brain, struck me in my right wrist, and I lost several seconds to pain before regaining my senses.
Sir, you have my word as eyewitness to the rest, and I suppose this wound as added proof, for the doctors they feared crippled me in the hand I use to write.
I will take the murderer's bullet to my grave.
Thanks.
Aces over eights, as I just now recall.
That is the hand that Wild Bill had.
Sure, captain.
Sure.
You like how that falls?
Sure.
- Do you like it, Flora?
- Why not?
I'd prefer you happy, honey, but if you can't be, you need to pretend at it better than you're doing or you're gonna be hungry and cold and getting done to you for nothing outside
what you'd have made money to live on and save up besides if you acted the part in here.
I thought I only had to act it with them that wanna stick it in me.
You never know who that might be, Flora.
There you go.
I prefer you happy.
Or at least pretending better?
I think he's dead, Doc.
Could you tell the litter bearers not to make so much of getting this one outta here?
- Has young Joey gone to dust?
- Yeah.
As flesh must, to be restored by the savior's return.
Oh, Mr. Bullock is back among us, and also, also Mr. Utter.
Does Charlie know about Bill?
They were together, Mr. Bullock and he.
They'd captured Jack McCall.
I hope that's only the beginning of what they fucking did to him.
- Gave him over to the federal authorities.
- Gave him over?
- Rendered unto Caesar.
- Jesus Christ.
Mr.-
- Mr. Bullock was struck by an Indian's axe.
Marked like the firstborn of Adam and Eve.
- Are you drunk?
- No.
(groaning)
- What the fuck is that?
- He's all right.
All right, Reverend.
All right, Reverend.
All right.
You're all right, Reverend.
All right.
He marks us sinful and forgiven by confession.
All right.
He has told us and shown us.
He has told me.
All right.
You listen to me now, Reverend.
You are goddamn exhausted and you give yourself no respite.
These seizures may owe something to that, but it also wouldn't surprise me if you had a lesion in your goddamn head and that's what's giving you the seizures and generating your chats with the goddamn Divinity.
No goddamn offense intended.
- None taken, sir.
- Now get outta here
- and get yourself some rest!
- Jane:
Go on, Reverend.
Doc's tired too, the only reason he's talking so fucking harsh.
Could not the lesion be the instrument of God's instructive intention, Doctor, if I am so afflicted?
Well, of course it could,
His ways not being ours and so forth.
But could He not, Reverend, just want you getting out of here and getting yourself some goddamn rest?
- Flora:
You have to go now.
- We don't have to do nothing.
I'd pay the same price just to sit with you.
My brother works in this place up here, Terrance, and he keeps a hard watch.
If you wanna stick it in me again tomorrow, you better let me go in by myself.
- What time are you gonna start?
- 11:00, I guess.
I'll be receiving around noon.
All right, Flora.
Here's a dollar anyway.
You're swell.
Evening.
Evening, miss.
- You're early.
- Yes.
- I guess no luck finding your dad.
- No, no luck.
I knew you would've had a cheerier look on your face if you had.
Let me get you a place to sit away from these rough sumbitches.
Hey!
Do your drinking at the bar or get the fuck out of here!
You have a seat here.
I'll get you a beverage.
Do you want a soft cider or a sarsaparilla?
- Cider if it's not a trouble.
- Soft cider.
Did she find her dad?
Her chances of finding her dad are greater than yours of walking out of this door upright, unless you shut your fucking mouth.
You got it?
Swearengen's had his hand on the tiller far as getting dealing with this epidemic.
- Is that so?
- The dead don't drink or chase women must be his thinking on that subject.
That Indian fought like hell.
I'd guess you did too.
Charlie figured out how it must have been.
The Indian had to kill me for coming on the burial place, and maybe it had been me too that killed his friend, cut his friend's head off so his friend wouldn't have eyes to see the sunset
all those years he'd be lying there dead.
So he had to kill me for that too.
And he couldn't before he'd laid hands on me or the killing wouldn't be honorable.
We fought like fucking hell, I'll tell you that much.
And I never once had the upper-hand.
It just happened out the way it happened out.
He was just trying to live, same as me, and do honor to his friend and make some fucking sense out of things.
And we wind up that way.
And I wind up after beating him till I couldn't recognize his face.
For Christ's sake!
That Indian saved Jack McCall's life,
- I'll tell you that fucking much.
- Not for long.
Brian MacDonald's not coming, I want his recommendation who should assay that widow's claim.
- Whose?
- Swearengen's.
Shit, Seth.
Get his opinion too, who should guard that henhouse we're gonna build.
So... are you okay?
- Yes.
And you?
- Yes.
They're nice here.
And Mr. Swearengen, he's funny as all get-out.
So what place would make a better score?
Where I'm working.
But why not take 'em both?
- Could we have a private talk?
- Sure we can.
- Should I be armed?
- Where do you wanna talk?
Come here.
What do you think of that?
I think that son of a bitch better stop looking evil at that little girl.
Al:
So was it McCall
- improved your appearance?
- No.
Whoever got the job done, I hope you gave as good as you got.
It's good to have you back, with me being superstitious and all hell breaking loose when you left.
I'm here to talk about Mrs. Garret.
That planted her husband this morning?
I wrote a man about coming to assay her claim,
- but he can't make it.
- Plenty of local alternatives.
I want you to nominate someone.
Do you?
So if any way his work was mistaken, I'd be coming after you.
- You would?
- Yeah.
Since I got nothing to do with the fucking venture, what if I decline to make the fucking recommendation?
Then you better hope whoever I find does his job right, 'cause I'm still holding you accountable.
I ain't involved.
EB Farnum offered on her claim.
Farnum's your water-boy and I know what you've been trying to do to her.
So here you come in all nobility... threatening me with a dire result if the property that widow's husband thought worthless and wanted sold turns out not to be pinched out.
You and I know how it is, Mr. Swearengen.
- How what is?
- She gets a square shake, or I come for you.
What if I come for you?
Are you ready for that?
I guess I'd better be.
Then close your fucking store, 'cause being ready for me will take care of your waking hours and you better have someone to hand the task off to when you close your eyes.
We understand each other.
Johnny:
Al!
Al!
Jesus fucking Christ!
Walk right past me, Your Holiness, so I can shut my fucking office.
Al!
Dan:
Go on!
Stare at her now!
Huh?
You like fucking little girls?
Take a look at that little girl 'cause she's the last thing you're ever gonna see.
- Stare at her now, cocksucker.
- Al:
Let him down!
Let him fucking down!
(gagging)
Or should I have had him hold him up?
You head what I said about the widow.
Oh yes, Your Holiness.
You heard me too.
So I take it this was a fair fucking fight, yeah?
Men:
Yeah!
That's right!
- Two free drinks for everybody.
- (men cheering)
And drinks all night for them that helps with the disposal.
Man #2:
That's me!
I'm sorry that you had to see that.
Shut the fuck up, Dan, and get her the fuck away from here-- now!
Come on.
I'm sorry, Mr. Swearengen.
I warned him not to look at her.
I warned him.
Fucking pussy.
Jane:
That Joey passed this afternoon.
Been suffering awful.
But that frog-looking fellow left the tent that I found up in the woods, left the tent a fucking cure pronounced by the doc himself.
And in the dumbest looking outfit a grown man ever wore.
Who's there, God damn it?
!
Who the hell's it look like?
How the fuck do I know who it fucking looks like?
It's dark!
Jesus Christ, come upon a person unawares in a fucking graveyard!
I heard you was back in the camp.
I heard you and that Bullock got the cocksucker did for Bill.
Was Bill dead by the time you saw him?
Yeah, he was already dead.
Why did he let that son of a bitch get to him?
I don't know, Charlie.
Anyways, people don't scare me past speaking,
I come up here nights tell him the fucking news.
Go ahead.
Charlie avenged your fucking murder.
And that Bullock fella was with me that you seemed to like.
Although it occurred to me to wonder why they didn't do for the cocksucker right on the fucking spot.
Is that something we need to get into in front of him?
You got the biggest mouth in the territory.
You talk to him.
Tell him whatever you want.
I got that mail route in Cheyenne that we talked about.
I was bringing back supplies to them hardware boys and I run into that Bullock fella.
He was out there looking for that McCall that-- that killed you.
And he run into some heathen boy and he had one hell of a fight.
Boy, and he just-- he got-- he got f-- he got f-f--
Fuck.
Can I-- can I tell him some more tomorrow?
Sure.
What the fuck you asking me for?
I don't make the rules.
Wanna go back to the camp?
Please.
And what must Mr. Bullock have been thinking as I inflicted my personal confidences upon him?
- I don't know.
- Nor do I.
At least he kept a decent privacy.
I have to go back to The Gem.
He's waiting for me now to tell him yours and Mr. Bullock's thinking about selling the claim, and I won't be able to lie anymore.
Next I tell will be my last.
So I better just get back there.
Mr. Swearengen discovered our deception?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Looking at you walk out the fucking hotel.
- He did not.
I was careful to see he wasn't watching in the window.
It don't matter, Mrs. Garret.
The point is, I gotta go back.
And you need someone to look to this child.
And with choices bigger elsewhere and nothing I can tell to hold you here, maybe you better think about selling and getting out.
Would you wanna take the girl and go?
Where?
- I have no people anywhere.
- You could go to New York.
I could have my relatives there see you established.
What the fuck?
What would keep you here?
You wanna fuck this man?
Fuck him, then think about the child--
Don't use that language with me, Trixie, or that tone.
Don't you wanna say to remember my place?
I do, you rich cunt, and I'm going back to it.
She's about to say her name, you know.
She named her sisters and her folks.
Think of selling.
If you took her away, you could hear her say it.

Reverend:
MY DARLING WIFE... ( panting ) I HAVE $68 PUT BY--
OUR BELLY CLEAVETH TO THE EARTH.
I HOPE TO BE HOME SOON, AMANDA.
I'LL HELP WITH THE CIDER PRESSING.
( groaning )
OUR SOUL IS BOWED DOWN TO THE DUST.
TELL JOHNNY TO BREW SOME COFFEE, OPEN SOME PEACHES.
- WHO ARE THEY?
IS THAT THE MAGISTRATE?
- SOME WITH SOLDIER SADDLES.
- AL KNEW THEY WAS COMIN'.
- WELL, HE KNEW SOMETHIN' WAS COMIN'.
I'D ABOUT DECIDED HE JUST COULDN'T SLEEP WITHOUT TRIXIE.
GENERAL CROOK BEARS VICTORY'S GARLAND FOR HAVING ROUTED THE MINICONJOU AT SLIM BUTTES.
- WELL DONE, GENERAL.
- THE FIRST MEETING OUT OF RECOMPENSE
FOR THE MASSACRE AT THE LITTLE BIG HORN.
AM I RIGHT IN BELIEVING THAT I SAW YOU LAST YEAR IN THE HILLS?
AMONGST THEM YOU GAVE THE BOOT TO?
YOU SAID YOU'D SEE US BACK ONCE THE TREATY GOT AMENDED.
THE DAY THE GENERAL SPOKE OF...
FAST APPROACHES.
EVEN NOW HE'S CALLED TO CAMP ROBINSON... ( whispering ) I'M WAITIN' FOR AL TO COLLECT CLAGETT
BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK.
HE AND HIS MEN WOULD REQUIRE SOME RESUPPLY AND RESPITE.
- STOPPED AT THE RIGHT FUCKIN' PLACE.
- RESPITE, MR. SWEARENGEN.
SHORT OF THE MEN BECOMING DISSOLUTE OR DRAWN TO DESERTION.
UNSADDLED, ALLOWED TO GAMBLE, ROLL IN THE DUST, HMM?
BUT NOT SO THEY BALK AT REHARNESS.
I'LL MAKE YOUR FEELINGS KNOWN TO THE OTHER OPERATORS.
I AND MY FELLOW OFFICERS WOULD BE GRATEFUL NOW FOR THE USE OF THE BATHHOUSE.
MR. BURNS HERE WILL STEER YOU.
FOR THOSE THAT AVENGED CUSTER, IF IT AIN'T TOO DISSOLUTE,
THE CAMP WILL WANT A PARADE.
A PARADE IS ALL RIGHT.
FOREGO YOUR BATH A MOMENT, MAGISTRATE,
UNLESS YOU WANT A GIRL TO SPONGE YOU WHILE WE CONVERSE?
SO DID YOUNG ADAMS DELIVER MY MESSAGE?
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOUNG ADAMS.
- NO?
- I HAVEN'T BEEN TO YANKTON.
I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING THE TERRITORY IN THE TREATY NEGOTIATIONS.
WELL, AS TO BRIBING YOU FURTHER FOR HELP WITH THAT WARRANT AGAINST ME
BEYOND THE $5,000 YOU'VE ALREADY POCKETED,
THE GIST WAS "FUCK YOURSELF."
- DO YOU NOW RECONSIDER?
- NO, MAGISTRATE, I DO NOT.
NOT IF YOU'VE SEEN ADAMS OR IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ADAMS.
WELL, THAT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT, AL.
A FAILURE TO PROPERLY VALUE YOUR FREEDOM IN THE PROMISING DAYS AHEAD.
MAYBE YOU DON'T VALUE KEEPING YOUR FUCKING GUTS INSIDE YOUR BELLY ENOUGH.
- THOSE ARE THE DAYS BEHIND US.
- NO,
THOSE ARE THE DAYS TO MY FUCKING LEFT.
I DIDN'T GENERATE THE WARRANT.
MY DISAPPEARANCE WON'T QUASH IT.
YOU CAN'T MURDER AN ORDER
OR THE TELEGRAPH THAT TRANSMITTED IT
OR THOSE THAT ARE CONTENT TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE
SIMPLY BY BEING ITS INSTRUMENTS.
IT CAN'T BE DONE.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY JOINT.
ALTHOUGH THIS MAY APPEAR TO BE A FORTUITOUS ACCIDENT--
YOU'RE NOT IN THIS, JOHNNY BURNS--
I WOULD BE LESS THAN HONEST IF I DID NOT ADMIT THAT I WAS
IN FACT LYING IN WAIT, IN AMBUSH, IF YOU WILL.
- SIR, MAKE YOUR FIRST EFFORT COUNT.
- SECONDS AWAY.
A.W.:
NOW, GENERAL...
YOUR MOST VICTORIOUS SMILE.
ALL RIGHT.
STERN AND RESOLUTE!
THIS BLOATED TICK CLAGETT,
FEEDIN' ON THE NECK OF THE FUCKING MILITARY.
I GUESS HE BOUGHT HIS BAGMAN BACK.
WHO I COMMISSIONED TO KILL HIM.
- HE PROCLAIMS THEIR PATHS NEVER CROSSED.
- I GUESS HE WOULD.
CAN YOU IMAGINE, AL, THAT AS MAYOR,
I MIGHT LIKE TO LEARN THE CAVALRY'S IN CAMP
OTHER THAN BY COMING UPON THEM POSING FOR PHOTOGRAPHS
IN THE GODDAMN THOROUGHFARE?
!
CAVALRY'S IN CAMP, E.B.
- AT WHOSE BEHEST?
- THE PEOPLE, AS ALWAYS.
- TO WHAT PURPOSE?
- A PARADE'S IN THE OFFING.
THEY'VE HAD A VICTORY OVER THE DIRT WORSHIPPERS.
WILL YOU LEAD THE HOSANNAS?
WELL, I SUPPOSE THAT'S PART OF MY MANDATE.
MIGHTN'T I ALSO COORDINATE SATISFACTION OF THE FORCE'S LOGISTICAL NEEDS?
I HOPE YOU CHARGE SOMETHING FOR YOUR SERVICE.
CAVALRY IN CAMP, DOC.
MAY I NUMBER YOU IN THE RECEPTION COMMITTEE?
FUCK THE CAVALRY AND THE COMMITTEE THAT RECEIVES 'EM!
HI, DOC.
THE FUCKIN' MAGISTRATE DON'T GO BACK TO YANKTON ALIVE.
TRIXIE?
YOU SEEN JEWEL AROUND ANYWHERES?
COMMON ROOM.
SWEEPIN'.
HEY, DOC?
WHAT YOU GOT IN YOUR TOTE SACK?
LETTUCE.
SET YOUR BROOM TO ONE SIDE AND SIT DOWN.
I SAID PUT YOUR BROOM ASIDE.
YOU HAVE TO REMOVE IT FROM MY CLUTCHES.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
I MAKE THIS STIPULATION.
YOU DEVELOP ANY STIFFNESS OR NUMBNESS, YOU REPORT THESE.
YOU DO NOT CONCEAL THESE SYMPTOMS IN ORDER
TO SUSTAIN YOUR HOPES FOR THE MIRACULOUS BENEFITS
OF YOUR FUCKING BOOT.
THAT'S MY FUCKIN' BOOT?
YOU LOSE A LEG, YOUR OTHER CONDITIONS WILL PREVENT YOU FROM MOVING AROUND AT ALL,
AND I WILL NOT HAVE YOU LOSE THE MOBILITY THAT YOU DO HAVE
FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW WEEKS' ILLUSION.
I'LL REPORT STIFFNESS OR NUMBNESS.
( whispers ) ALL RIGHT.
AND PAIN OR DISCOMFORT!
DON'T YOU BE THE DOCTOR!
YOU REPORT THE SYMPTOMS, I WILL DETERMINE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE!
DON'T YELL, DOC!
I AM YELLING BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU GODDAMN UNDERSTAND ME!
I DO.
I UNDERSTAND.
( whispers ) ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S YOUR GODDAMN BOOT.
HELP ME PUT IT ON.
WALK IN UNANNOUNCED IS A GOOD WAY TO GET YOURSELF KILLED, DOC.
ESPECIALLY AS THE CAVALRY HAS US BESIEGED.
I'M HERE ABOUT THE MINISTER.
HE'S OVER AT MY PLACE,
PAST MY ART IF I HAD ANY.
HE'S DAMN NEAR BLIND AND MOSTLY PARALYZED.
PAST CONTROLLING HIS FUNCTIONS.
WELL, YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE FUCKING CONVERTED.
I MEAN...
I WOULD'VE SEEN TO HIM, BUT...
I'VE BEEN FUCKING BUSY.
WELL, HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE SEEN TO LIKE THAT.
WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
A MAN BEING CARED FOR,
AND MADE COMFORTABLE TILL HE EXPIRES.
THE GIRLS YOU PUT TO THE TASK,
DEDUCT YOUR TIME FROM MY PAY.
I GET THE BAG OF SHIT.
YOU GET TO CARE FOR A HUMAN BEING IN HIS LAST EXTREMITY.
A HUMAN BEING IN HIS LAST EXTREMITY IS A BAG OF SHIT.
OH, FUCK YOU, AL!
I'LL SEND SOMEONE OVER TO PICK HIM UP.
I MADE JEWEL A BRACE AND A BOOT.
DOES IT ALLAY THE FUCKING NOISE SHE MAKES WHEN SHE DRAGS HER LEG ABOUT?
IF THE NOISE BOTHERS YOU SO MUCH, PUT COTTON IN YOUR EARS.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE, DOC, HUH?
I'M WORKING ON MY DEPLOYMENTS AND FLANKING MANEUVERS.
HOW ABOUT THAT OTHER ONE?
TRIXIE'S FINE.
JOHNNY!
TAKE THE SLED TO DOC COCHRAN'S.
COLLECT THE FUCKING MINISTER AND INSTALL HIM IN THE WHORE'S QUARTERS.
TELL THAT OTHER ONE TO MAKE UP THE FUCKING ROOM.
TRIXIE?
THESE RAGS WERE FINE BROADCLOTH SHIRTS
BEFORE I BRUNG 'EM TO LAUNDER.
HUH?
SIX...
SIX BITS...
NO, NO.
YOU TOLD ME--
LOOKS TO ME LIKE A DETERIORATING SITUATION, SHERIFF.
YUP.
TOO FREQUENT TO BE BORNE.
DOWNRIGHT INTOLERABLE.
Leon:
SIX BITS A GODDAMN PIECE, YOU HEAR ME?
WHAT THE FUCK YOU TALKING ABOUT?
LOOK AT THIS GODDAMN SHIT.
WHAT IS THAT?
I HOPE THAT SLANT-EYED COCKSUCKER'S LOOK
AIN'T AS ARROGANT CLOSE UP AS IT APPEARS FROM THIS DISTANCE!
SMELLS LIKE SHIT.
YOU CELESTIALS
ARE TRYING TO WASH OUR SHIRTS IN GODDAMN FECES!
Otis:
MINING GOLD, ALMA, IS A DIFFERENT BUSINESS
FROM PANNING IT IN A STREAM.
THE MACHINERY INVOLVED, THE WAGES,
IT DEMANDS CAPITAL.
( chuckles )
IF, AS SEEMS CLEAR, YOU'VE DETERMINED TO STAY,
I COULD SEE AFTER YOUR REQUIREMENTS IN NEW YORK,
SECURE YOUR HOLDINGS' CREDIT AS ITS EASTERN REPRESENTATIVE.
WOULD THAT PLEASE YOU?
I-
- I DON'T KNOW, DADDY.
- I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD.
- WHY NOT?
I'M NOT SURE I CAN EXPLAIN BEYOND
SAYING THE PROSPECT FRIGHTENS ME.
MUST THE PRETENSE OF MY BEHAVIOR GENERATING FROM...
PATERNAL CONCERN BE ABANDONED SO QUICKLY?
IF YOU ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT ELSE IT GENERATES FROM,
I'LL NOT ABANDON THE IDEA AT ALL.
FROM MY DEBTS, OF COURSE.
YOU SAID THEY'D BEEN ENTIRELY SATISFIED.
THEY HAD, ENTIRELY.
THOSE DEBTS.
THESE ARE DEBTS YOU HADN'T ADMITTED?
NO, THESE ARE DEBTS I INCURRED SUBSEQUENTLY.
WE MIGHT CALL THEM THE CHILDREN OF THE DEBTS THAT I ADMITTED TO.
GENERATING FROM THE INTEREST ON THE PREVIOUS DEBTS?
ALMA...
WATCHING YOU STRUGGLE WITH WHAT IS BENEATH
YOUR SPIRIT TO UNDERSTAND IS ALWAYS PAINFUL FOR ME.
AFTER YOU GOT ME OUT OF DEBT, I GOT MYSELF BACK IN.
HAVING VOLUNTEERED A PROMISE YOU HAD...
WEPT AND VOLUNTEERED?
CONCEIVE MY OWN DISAPPOINTMENT.
- OH, DADDY.
- ( sighs ) 47,000, BUTTON.
47,000?
HAS SCALE, DOESN'T IT?
CERTAINLY, THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT.
( chuckles )
WHO WOULD GIVE YOU THAT MUCH CREDIT?
MY DAUGHTER BECOMING A GARRET RAISED ME IN THE LENDER'S ESTIMATION.
- I COULD BORROW THAT MUCH AGAINST THE CLAIM?
-IN AN INSTANT...
AND CONSIDERABLY MORE.
ALL RIGHT, DADDY.
BUT IN CONSIDERATION, YOU WILL...
REMOVE YOURSELF FROM FURTHER CONNECTION TO THE VENTURE.
I'LL HAVE THAT IN WRITING BEFORE I HELP YOU.
NO, DARLING.
YOU'LL HELP ME...
AND YOU'LL HAVE NO SUCH THING.
( whispers ) GET AWAY FROM HER.
GET AWAY FROM HER!
THE MEAL'S ON ME, YOUNG LADY.
WHY, THANK YOU, SIR.
( sobbing )
MY FRIEND JANE REPAID SOME MONEY I THOUGHT NEVER TO SEE,
PLUS $2 SOME-ODD FOR MRS. GARRET TO GIVE THAT GIRL.
FINES SHE LEVIED AGAINST HERSELF FOR SAYING "FUCK" OR THE LIKE.
SOMETHING AMISS, MRS. GARRET?
HAS THE CHILD TOOK ILL?
( sobbing )
I'LL GIVE HER THE MONEY LATER.
SETH.
WHAT IS IT, MRS. GARRET?
SETH, I'VE GOT TO GO DO THAT...
THING.
- WHAT IS IT?
- WHATEVER IMPRESSION MY FATHER HAS MADE ON YOU,
PLEASE BELIEVE ME, MR. BULLOCK,
WHO HAS KNOWN HIM LONGER, THAT HE IS HERE IN HIS OWN INTERESTS...
AND AGAINST MINE AND THIS CHILD'S.
I DO.
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.
I'M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.
YOU HAVE IT.
A.W.:
HAVING CONFESSED TO THE MISERABLE OUTCOME OF MY COMMEMORATIVE EFFORT,
I'LL THROW MYSELF ON GENERAL CROOK'S MERCY AND ASK FOR A SECOND OPPORTUNITY.
I'LL BE SURPRISED IF HE DOESN'T GIVE IT TO YOU.
THEY LOVE-- TO HAVE THEIR PICTURES TAKEN.
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- GET AWAY FROM ME, SOL.
- WHAT IS IT?
- GET AWAY.
- SHOULD I STAY WITH HER AT THE STORE?
- PLEASE.
ANTEMERIDIAN CONSTITUTIONAL, MR. RUSSELL,
OR WILL WE ROLL THE BONES AGAIN?
IT MUST COST YOU SLEEP--
THE GUESTS YOU DRIVE OFF, THE CHANCES OF THIEVING
AND BILKING YOU LOSE, NEEDING TO RUB AGAINST YOUR BETTERS.
- YOU AND I ARE GONNA TALK.
- YOU DON'T ACCOUNT FOR MY PREFERENCES, MR. BULLOCK?
I WILL BEAT YOU HERE IN THE STREET.
FIRST-RATE THINKING.
MY DAUGHTER'S AGENT BEATS HER FATHER IN THE STREET.
HOW BETTER TO CONDEMN ALMA TO DEEPENED SUSPICION
AS TO HER ROLE IN HER HUSBAND'S VIOLENT DEATH
AND WIDEN SUSPICION TO INCLUDE YOURSELF?
SHOOT CRAPS, MR. BULLOCK?
I KNOW WHAT'S IN THE TILL.
WERE YOU BULLIED, MR. BULLOCK, WHEN YOUNG AND INCAPABLE?
NOW YOU SEE WRONGS EVERYWHERE AND BULLYING YOU FEEL CALLED TO REMEDY?
- 10, LAY DUE.
- NEW SHOOTER COMING OUT.
THE BULLY WHO OPPRESSED YOUR YOUTH
ISN'T AT THE TABLE WITH US.
- PERHAPS HE'S LONGDEAD.
- EIGHT.
IF YOU WILL VIEW THE PRESENT WITH MORE CLARITY,
PERHAPS YOU'D RECOGNIZE THAT I'M NOT VICTIMIZING MY DAUGHTER,
BUT MERELY ASKING FOR A SMALL PORTION OF THE AMPLE PROCEEDS...
- FROM HER VEINS.
- Dealer:
SEVEN OUT.
ALMA IS HURT ONLY IN YOUR PARTICULAR VIEW OF THINGS.
10 AGAIN, LAY DUE.
AND WHILE I'LL SIGN NO GUARANTEE NOT TO RETURN,
OR AGAINST ANY FUTURE CLAIM ON HER COMPASSION,
REALIZE I DO HATE IT HERE.
AND IF YOU INHALE AND EXPEL PURE RIGHTEOUSNESS,
MY OLFACTORIES ARE KEEN TO THE SMELL OF SHIT.
- SIX, THE POINT IS SIX.
- HAVING HEARD ALL THAT, ANDKNOWING,AS YOUMUST,
THE INJUDICIOUSNESS OF MAKING AN ENEMY OF A MAN
WHO COULD TESTIFY TRUTHFULLY THAT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE HER MARRIAGE,
HE HEARD HIS DAUGHTER WISH HER PROSPECTIVE HUSBAND DEAD,
AND WHO WON'T SHRINK FROM LYING AS TO WHAT SHE ADMITTED
TO HIM ON HIS ARRIVAL IN THIS CESSPOOL
AS TO HER COMPLICITY IN HER HUSBAND'S MURDER...
I SUPPOSE YOU'D BEST TAKE YOUR SWING.
GENTLEMEN, WATCH THE FELT.
Sol:
SETH.
SETH!
SETH!
Seth:
ALL RIGHT.
LEAVE THIS CAMP, AND DRAW A MAP
FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BELIEVE YOUR FUCKING LIES.
ANYONE WANTS TO PUT YOUR DAUGHTER
OR HER HOLDINGS IN JEOPARDY, YOU SHOW 'EM HOW TO GET HERE.
AND YOU TELL 'EM I'LL BE WAITING.
( distant drum corps playing )
( whispering ) PLEASE...
- SEE TO MY FATHER.
- ( marching band playing )
( gunshot )
( shouting in Chinese )
NOW, GENTLEMEN, STAY BACK!
THIS AIN'T NO SINGLE-SHOT DERRINGER.
HE TRIED TO BLIND ME WITH THAT LYE, SHERIFF, FOR SHOWING WHAT HE DONE TO MY SHIRTS.
( speaking Chinese )
- FUCK THAT MONKEY NOISE!
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH!
...TILL I CAN SORT OUT ALL THE FULL PARTICULARS HERE.
YOU MAY BE A BIG SHOT IN THIS ALLEY, BUT YOU ARE LESS THAN A NIGGER TO ME!
- ( speaks Chinese )
- QUIET!
- OR YOU'LL BE SUBJECT TO REPRIMAND.
- ( shouting in Chinese )
TAKE JURISDICTION ON THIS CORPSE!
Man:
BACK OFF, OLD MAN.
( band continues playing )
( band stops playing )
General:
THE SIOUX AND THE CHEYENNE HAVING BURNED THE PRAIRIE
TO DENY US FODDER FOR OUR MOUNTS,
OUR PROVISIONS LIMITED TO WHAT WE COULD CARRY,
WE TURNED FOR THE BLACK HILLS WHEN THE RAINS BEGAN.
WHERE MY BAY MARE SHERATON FOUNDERED, AND GOT SHOT.
General:
THAT MARCH THROUGH MUD WAS A TRIAL SENT BY GOD,
AND HARSH NECESSITY REQUIRED OF US
MUCH SUFFERING AND GREAT SACRIFICE.
ATE OUR FUCKING HORSES!
CONTINUING SOUTH, WE PROVED OUR WORTH AGAINST THE INDIAN.
WE CAME UPON A VILLAGE
AT SLIM BUTTES,
AT ONCE ATTACKED FROM ALL FOUR SIDES.
THEIR RESISTANCE WAS OVERCOME.
THERE WERE NO PRISONERS.
PAID 'EM OUT MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD FOR ME HAVING TO EAT MY MARE.
AND AFTER THE VILLAGE WAS TAKEN,
WE FOUND THE GLOVES OF CAPTAIN KEOGH,
LAST SEEN ON HIS PERSON WHEN HE RODE INTO BATTLE...
WITH THE VALIANT CUSTER.
CAPTAIN.
THIS IS THE GUIDON OF THE 7TH CAVALRY
CAPTURED BY THE SIOUX AT THE LITTLE BIG HORN.
AND NOW RECLAIMED BY WHITE MEN!
CHIEF AMERICAN HORSE AND HIS VILLAGE
ARE GONE, DRIVEN OFF.
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD...
- WHERE'S THE CUNT?
- ...
ANY SIOUX WHO WILL NOTMAKEPEACE
- AT CAMP ROBINSON--
- I'M GLAD YOU WITNESSED THAT TRANSACTION
AMONGST THE CELESTIALS.
YOU KNOW, THEY'LL BOW AND SCRAPE TILL SIX OF 'EM GET TOGETHER,
THEN NO FUCKING WHITE MAN'S SAFE.
...TO THE PROGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES...
OF WHICH I AM CERTAIN
THIS CAMP...
WILL SOON BE A PART.
HUZZAH!
Scattered townspeople:
HUZZAH!
NEXT MURDER YOU DO ON AN ERRAND,
GOTTA TAKE OFF THE FUCKING BADGE.
NOT CERTAIN I TAKE YOUR INFERENCE.
AND IF I DO, I'M NOT SURE I LIKE IT.
LEAVE IT THERE, YOU BOUGHT-OUT SON OF A BITCH.
CAPTAIN BUBB IS THE QUARTERMASTER AND COMMISSARY OFFICER.
- SHOULD HE DEAL WITH YOU?
- EXCLUSIVELY.
- E.B. FARNUM--
- THAT'S CAPTAIN BUBB.
MAYOR.
AND AS TO PROCUREMENT OF EVERYTHING LISTED,
YOUR CIVILIAN COUNTERPART.
GENERAL CROOK, I BELIEVE I HAVE YOU VERBATIM,
- BUT IF YOU'D JUST GRANT ME A MOMENT TO CONFIRM?
- OH MY GOD.
UM, "THE SIOUX AND CHEYENNE WILL SOON BE A PART."
YOU'LL FIND THIS HOTEL THE LEAST OF ALL EVILS.
DOES IT BELONG TO THAT MAYOR?
YES, BUT I CAN CHECK YOU IN.
GENERAL, CYRUS TOLLIVER.
SMALL GESTURE OF GRATITUDE, I'D LIKE YOU TO QUARTER AT MY PLACE.
( coughing ) BROTHEL.EXCUSE ME.
WELL, THAT PORTION TO MY USE WOULD HAVE TO BE CLOSED TO OTHER PURPOSES.
( laughs )
WELL, THAT'D MAKE IT A LARGE GESTURE, BUT, UH,
WE'LL WORK SOMETHING OUT.
- SEND MY TRUNK, CAPTAIN BUBB.
- YES, SIR.
THIS IS A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PROVISIONS, CAPTAIN.
BUT, OF COURSE, YOU'RE BUYING FOR FULL-GROWN MEN.
I WON'T DO A TWO ON ONE.
TAKE TURNS LIKE WHITE MEN.
I DON'T CARE IF THE WHOLE U.S. CAVALRY WALKS IN HERE,
YOU DON'T WANT TO POUR ANOTHER DRINK.
YOU JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO ME 'CAUSE IF THE MAN DOESN'T DIE WHOSE FACE I JUST BROKE,
HE'S GONNA GO TO NEW YORK CITY
AND TELL BROM GARRET'S PEOPLE IT BREAKS HIS HEART TO SAY SO,
BUT HIS DAUGHTER HAD THEIR SON MURDERED.
HE'LL TELL 'EM, KNOWING HOW HE DOES,
THEY WON'T WANT THEIR SON'S RIGHTFUL PROPERTY
IN THE HANDS OF THE WOMAN WHO KILLED HIM.
HE'LL SWEAR TO WHAT HE HEARD FROM HER OWN LIPS.
AND THOSE SOCIETY PEOPLE IN NEW YORK CITY,
WHO LIVE WITH THEIR HEADS UP THEIR ASSES ANYWAY, WILL BELIEVE HIM.
AND WHOEVER THEY SEND OUT HERE MAY TAKE UP TO 15 MINUTES
BEFORE THEY DECIDE THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED
IN THE TRANSACTION FIRST TO LAST.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN YOU AND YOUR BOSS SHE HIRED
TO PUSH HER IDIOT HUSBAND OFF THE CLIFF.
OF COURSE, THEY'LL BE WRONG ABOUT MRS. GARRET,
BUT THEY'LL BE RIGHT AS RAIN ABOUT YOU TWO COCKSUCKERS.
YOU TELL HIM ALL THAT UPSTAIRS.
IF HE DON'T DIE.
IF HE DON'T DIE.
I DON'T THINK I KILLED HIM.
JUST SO I UNDERSTAND YOU,
IF HE DON'T DIE,
YOU'RE SAYING THE MAN'S LUCK DON'T HAVE TO HOLD OUT.
NOW, THAT'S THE MESSAGE YOU WANT ME TO TAKE UPSTAIRS.
I DON'T SWIM IN THAT SHIT.
YOU OUGHT TO PIN THAT ON YOUR CHEST.
YOU'RE HYPOCRITE ENOUGH TO WEAR IT.
YOU JUST TELL HIM.
WHEN DID YOU START THINKING EVERY WRONG HAD A REMEDY, WU?
DID YOU COME TO CAMP FOR JUSTICE
OR TO MAKE YOUR FUCKING WAY?
!
( crowd chattering )
I'M SENSING YOU'VE DONE THINGS TODAY
YOU WISH YOU COULD AMEND, SETH.
WHAT KIND OF A MAN HAVE I BECOME, SOL?
I DON'T KNOW.
THE DAY AIN'T FUCKING OVER.
UNDER WHAT PROVOCATION WAS THAT CLOWN-HATTED CARD-SHARP
WHEN HE SLAUGHTERED THE CHINK?
I WAS HEAD DOWN, AL, TOWING THAT MINISTER LIKE A CANAL MULE.
WELL, IN THE AFTERMATH, WHEN YOU RAISED YOUR FUCKING HEAD,
DID STAPLETON ACT LIKE A FUCKING FRIGHTENED MAN?
MORE STRUTTING LIKE A DUNGHILL ROOSTER.
PUT-UP FUCKING JOB.
THAT FUCKNUT TOLLIVER'S MOVING ON CHINATOWN.
THAT DEVIOUS FUCKNUT.
AS FAR AS THIS MATTER BULLOCK COMMENDED TO OUR ATTENTION...?
WELL, IT'S THE EXACT TYPE MURDER YOU PREACH, AL.
HEAD OFF TROUBLE DOWN THE ROAD.
YOU HEAD OFF TROUBLE DOWN THE ROAD ONCE YOU'VE DEALT WITH THE TROUBLE ON IT.
THE TROUBLE ON THE ROAD, DAN,
IS AL'S ENEMY MAGISTRATE CLAGETT'S
COZY-SEEMING CONNECTION TO THE MILITARY.
IF GENUINE, AL MUST DECIDE--
OUGHT HE SEEK SOME ALLIANCE WITH CLAGETT,
HOWEVER TEMPORARY OR DISSEMBLED?
AT LEAST UNTIL YOU'RE PAID FOR THE ARMY'S ORDER.
THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME FUCKING PLACE.
TOLLIVER, THE WIDOW'S FATHER, CLAGETT--
I CAN TAKE CARE OF ALL OF 'EM IN ONE FELL SWOOP.
WHAT ABOUT HALF OF THE CAVALRY WHILE YOUR TALONS ARE OUT, HUH?
I'LL TELL YOU, BY GOD, YOU CUT THAT FUCKING GENERAL'S THROAT,
YOU'LL...
YOU'LL HURRY THE PACE OF DESERTION.
( chuckling )
DID I SAY SOMETHING FUNNY?
THAT COCKSUCKER CLAGETT'S BAGMAN.
MODERATION IN ALL THINGS.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, SIR.
- Soldier:
MUCH OBLIGED.
- GOOD LUCK.
Cy:
WITH ALL RESPECT TO THE MAGISTRATE CLAGETT, GENERAL,
EAGER AS WE ARE TO GET TAKEN INTO THE TERRITORY, THOSE WHEELS GRIND SLOW,
WHILE EVERY DAY IN THIS CAMP AND ENVIRONS
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN GOLD GET CLEANED UP, AND PUT INTO CIRCULATION.
IT'S AN ENVIRONMENT TO TEST THE MORAL METTLE
IF WE WAS ALL MEMBERS OF SOME RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION.
WHICH WE AIN'T.
ARE WE SURE WE CAN'T TEMPT YOU?
I'M SURE.
A SMALL FRACTION OF YOUR DETACHMENT LEFT BEHIND,
A DOZEN OR 18 MEN, SAY,
WOULD KEEP THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT IN CHECK.
CASH COMPENSATION, UNRECORDED.
TO DEFEND AGAINST THREATS FROM WITHOUT,
I SUGGEST THE CAMP CREATE A MILITIA.
FOR CIVIL DISORDERS AND PROPERTY DISAGREEMENTS,
HAVE YOU HIRED A SHERIFF?
( chuckles ) YEAH, WE GOT ONE.
DID YOU SAY TO ME EARLIER, MR. TOLLIVER,
THAT YOU IMAGINED THAT THE CHIEF USE OF THE MILITARY PRESENCE
WAS TO BUTTRESS THE SHERIFF'S AUTHORITY?
SUCH INDIRECTION FOR SUCH A TAWDRY PURPOSE.
$50,000 IN GOLD.
I WANT THOSE SOLDIERS, GENERAL.
IS THAT DIRECT ENOUGH?
MAY I SPEAK?
MR. BULLOCK.
I WAS A MARSHAL IN MONTANA.
MY FATHER SERVED IN THE BRITISH ROYAL ARMY,
AND MY BROTHER ROBERT WAS A CAVALRYMAN
KILLED FIGHTING THE COMANCHEROS IN TEXAS.
WHY ARE YOU HERE, MR. BULLOCK?
A MAN NAMED OTIS RUSSELL IS LAID UP IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT.
- HE NEEDS PROTECTION.
- PROTECTION FROM WHOM?
SEVERAL IN THIS CAMP.
I BEAT HIM BADLY.
OTHERS HAVE REASON TO WISH HIM DEAD,
AND THE CAMP SHERIFF CAN BE BOUGHT OFF FOR HALF A CAN OF BACON GREASE.
WELL, WHILE WE'RE HERE,
I WILL HOLD MR. RUSSELL UNDER PROTECTION
AS A GESTURE TO YOUR BROTHER'S SACRIFICE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
I WOULD ADD-
- IN A CAMP
WHERE THE SHERIFF CAN BE BOUGHT FOR BACON GREASE,
A MAN, A FORMER MARSHAL
WHO UNDERSTANDS THE DANGER OF HIS OWN TEMPERAMENT,
MIGHT CONSIDER SERVING HIS FELLOWS.
MAY I HAVE A WORD, GENERAL?
I'M THROUGH.
THANK YOU.
WE ALL HAVE BLOODY THOUGHTS.
CAPTAIN BUBB?
THAT GOPHER-FACED MERCHANT'S AGENT,
HE'S TRYING FOR OUR EYE-TEETH, GENERAL.
I'D RATHER WE PROVISION WITH THE FUCKING SIOUX.
I HAVE THREE MEN UNDER GUARD FOR BURYING THEIR UNIFORMS
AND FIVE FOR BARTERING THEIR WEAPONS.
BARTERING THEM FOR WHAT?
WOMEN, CREDIT AT THE TABLES AND PROSPECTING TOOLS.
GOD DAMN IT.
FORM UP THE MEN.
WE'LL BIVOUAC TONIGHT OUTSIDE OF CAMP.
AT DAYLIGHT, WE HEAD FOR CAMP ROBINSON.
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SEEK REMEDY IN THE MANNER OF RESUPPLY, GENERAL.
WE MOVE FOR CAMP ROBINSON, MAGISTRATE, WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR COMPANY.
I QUITE UNDERSTAND.
12 MEN, GENERAL.
$50,000.
IF I WERE SHERIFF, I'D HAVE YOU HANGED.
Joanie:
I BROUGHT THESE.
ARE THESE MY FATHER'S?
COLLECTED OFF THE BELLA UNION FLOOR.
MAYBE MODEL REPLACEMENTS AFTER,
MAYBE JUST REMIND HIM NOT TO RUN HIS MOUTH.
( chuckles )
MISS STUBBS, WILL YOU PLEASE COME IN?
OH, ALL RIGHT.
JOANIE!
HI, SWEETHEART.
HE WILL LIVE, THOUGH, THAT SEEMS CLEAR?
SEEMS HE WILL.
MR. BULLOCK WAS MY AGENT IN THIS.
ON OUR WAY FROM SYRACUSE TO INDIANA
SO MY DADDY COULD TRY FARMING,
MY MAMA GOT CHOLERA AND DIED.
HE DIDN'T MAKE ANY BETTER A FARMER THAN MILLINERY CLERK,
BUT HE HAD A WAY ENOUGH WITH WORDS TO GET ME BELIEVING
THAT MY MAMA IN HEAVEN WANTED ME TO SEE TO HIS NEEDS.
AND THEN TO ADD TO THE EGG MONEY BY...
SEEING TO THE MEN HE BROUGHT,
AND SHE WANTED ME TALKING MY SISTERS
INTO SEEING TO HIS NEEDS, AND THEN TO THE MEN,
TILL HE SOLD ME TO CY TOLLIVER.
IF HE WAS HERE,
I'D WISH A BEATING MORNINGS AND EVENINGS ON MY DADDY
LIKE YOUR PA TOOK TODAY.
( loud knocks )
OH.
EVENING.
( whispers ) GOOD EVENING, MR. BULLOCK.
ARE YOU HUNGRY, HONEY?
WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN TO THAT LITTLE RESTAURANT
AND HAVE SOME DINNER?
UM, UH-
- SOPHIA.
YOU GO WITH MISS STUBBS FOR DINNER, OKAY?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SIT DOWN, MR. BULLOCK?
UNTIL YOUR FATHER'S WELL ENOUGH TO TRAVEL,
I'VE ASKED GENERAL CROOK TO SEE TO HIS SAFETY.
THANK YOU.
IF HE WERE TO LEAVE ONCE HE'S WELL
AND RETURN TO ACT AGAINST YOUR INTERESTS,
WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT THEN.
I STAND BEFORE YOU A MARRIED MAN.
YES.
TO YOUR BROTHER'S WIDOW,
AFTER HE WAS KILLED.
YOU TOOK THEIR FIVE-YEAR-OLD BOY AS YOUR OWN SON.
MARRIED.
YES.
IF YOU'D-
- IF YOU WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE BEHIND THE SCREEN...
( whispers ) WOULDN'T THAT DEFEAT OUR PURPOSE?
( saloon piano playing )
( sighs )
YOUNG ADAMS.
NO SATCHEL?
NO CASE?
DON'T TELL ME YOU SHRUNK THAT MAGISTRATE'S HEAD,
SO YOU CAN CARRY IT AROUND IN YOUR COAT.
AND THAT WARRANT AGAINST ME NOW QUASHED,
IS PEEKING OUT OF HIS TINY MOUTH?
I DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO KILL HIM.
HE'D LEFT YANKTON BY THE TIME I GOT THERE,
AND I FIGURED I'D CATCH HIM HERE.
MAYBE YOU'RE HERE TO IMPLEMENT
HIS FUCKING INTENTIONS AGAINST ME...
I GUESS YOU CHEW AT IT AWHILE,
YOU COULD WORK OUT HOW IT COULD BE THAT WAY.
HAVING GIVEN ME TIME AS HE HAS TO ESCAPE MY ANGRY MOOD,
IF I CONTINUE TO IGNORE HIS FUCKING EXTORTIONS.
IS THAT HOW YOU LEFT IT WITH HIM?
HE'S COMING BACK HERE TO SEE YOU?
GIVE YOU TIME TO MAKE UP WHICH SIDE YOU'RE ON, ADAMS.
IF THE COCKSUCKER WOULD EVER SHOW UP.
( Reverend panting )
FOR THAT WHICH I DO, I ALLOW NOT FOR...
WHAT I WOULD THAT I DO NOT, FOR--
GET OUT.
BUT WHAT I HATE, THAT, TOO, I--
( coughing )
NOW,
IF I WOULD DO WHAT I WOULD NOT,
IT IS NO MORE I THAT DO IT,
BUT SIN THAT DWELLETH IN ME.
JOHNNY.
( panting )
SHUT THE DOOR.
( door shuts )
Doc:
IF I WAS A MORE ADAPTABLE PRIMATE
OR ONE OF YOUR REGULAR PETITIONERS,
I SUSPECT I WOULDN'T FEEL THIS PAIN.
I GUESS I--
I'D HAVE A WAD OF CARTILAGE COVERING THE PATELLA,
PROTECTING ME FROM THIS--
( sighing )
THIS DISCOMFORT.
JESUS CHRIST.
JESUS CHRIST,
JUST PLEASE, GOD,
TAKE THAT MINISTER.
WHAT CONCEIVABLE
GODLY USE
IS HIS PROTRACTED SUFFERING TO YOU?
WHAT CONCEIVABLE GODLY USE?
WHAT CONCEIVABLE GODLY USE
WAS THE SCREAMING OF ALL THOSE MEN?
DID YOU-- DID YOU NEED TO HEAR THEIR DEATH AGONIES
TO KNOW YOUR-YOUR-- YOUR OMNIPOTENCE?
"MAMA!" "MOTHER, FIND MY ARM!"
"MOMMY!
MOMMY!
"THEY-
- THEY SHOT MY LEG OFF!"
"IT HURTS SO BAD.
IT HURTS SO BAD." ( breathing heavily )
ADMITTING MY UNDERSTANDING'S IMPERFECTION,
TRUSTING THAT YOU HAVE A PURPOSE,
PRAYING THAT YOU CONSIDER IT SERVED,
I BEG YOU TO RELENT.
THY WILL BE DONE, AMEN.
- OH, OH, OH--
- SHHH.
( panting )
SHHH.
( moaning )
YOU WANT TO BE A ROAD AGENT?
DEAL OUT DEATH WHEN CALLED UPON?
( choking )
MAKE A PROPER SEAL,
STOP UP THE BREATH,
APPLY PRESSURE EVEN AND FIRM,
LIKE PACKING A SNOWBALL.
( choking gasp )
YOU CAN GO NOW, BROTHER.
AL...
THAT-- MAGISTRATE'S HERE.
I GOT THOSE OTHER TWO GUYS WAITING UPSTAIRS.
JOIN 'EM.
GET THE SLED FOR HIM, HUH?
- ( piano playing ) - ( crowd chattering )
THINGS ARE IN THE SADDLE, AL.
TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN UPSTAIRS, HUH?
ADAMS YOUR EMPLOYEE,
AND HIS BUTLER.
YES, HOW ARE YOU, ADAMS?
I'M ALL RIGHT, SIR.
WE MISSED EACH OTHER IN YANKTON.
YES, I WAS IN THE COMPANY OF GENERAL CROOK.
ADAMS BORE YOU MY MESSAGE TO TRY FUCKING YOURSELF.
AND HERE HE IS IN YOUR OFFICE.
WELL, I FIGURED I'D CATCH UP WITH YOU HERE.
DO YOU NO LONGER SERVE HIS INTERESTS,
IS WHAT HE SEEMS TO WONDER.
ADAMS, FOR HIS PART, IS STONE-FEATURED,
STEELED IN HIS PURPOSE.
- WHICH HE'D BE...
- Al:
WHEREVER HIS ALLEGIANCE MAY LAY.
WELL, BE THAT AS IT MAY, MAGISTRATE,
LIVING AS WE ALL DO IN DOUBT, PLEASE PROCEED.
GENERAL CROOK'S AT THE POINT OF MAKING A DECISION
WHETHER TO GARRISON SOME NUMBER OF SOLDIERS HERE
OR TO LEAVE THE CAMP TO FIND ITS OWN WAY.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR STRONG PREFERENCE IN THIS REGARD.
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON
GENERAL CROOK HAS COME TO TRUST ME
AND RELY ON MY COUNSEL EXCLUSIVELY.
THE APPROPRIATE GESTURE MADE BY YOU TOWARD ME
WOULD LEAD ME TO DISSUADE THE GENERAL
FROM THE GARRISON OPTION,
AS WELL AS CLEAR AWAY FROM ABOVE
THE CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY
REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL LIABILITIES,
NAMELY THE INCIDENT IN CHICAGO.
YOU HAVE THE DOCUMENT OF INQUIRY FROM CHICAGO?
THE MURDER WARRANT.
YES, AL, I DO.
- ON YOUR PERSON?
- YES.
MAKE THE APPROPRIATE GESTURE,
AND THE CONSTABLE HAND OF THE PAST
WILL NO LONGER WEIGH UPON YOU.
WHAT MAN COULDN'T THAT BE SAID ABOUT?
( gagging )
- ( blade slices ) - ( groans )
I'LL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU THIS PAPER
WHEN YOU TAKE THAT FUCKING GUN OFF ME.
BOTH OF THEM.
SWADDLE THE COCKSUCKER AND DISPOSE OF HIM.
HIS MONEY AND EFFECTS ARE YOURS.
THAT DON'T COUNT TOWARDS THE 2,000.
NO, I STILL OWE YOU THE TWO.
- ( gunshots ) - ( bugle playing )
CROOK'S TROOPS ARE MUSTERING.
I DIDN'T THINK YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL SO SOON.
I DON'T BEGRUDGE HIM AN UNCOMFORTABLE JOURNEY.
I'LL SEE HIM SECURED.
AND AFTER THAT, HE'S ON HIS OWN.
- ( pounding on door)
- DOC!
DOC!
IT'S HERE-- YOUR COMPETITION.
OR IS THAT ONE OF YOUR FUCKING HERESIES?
HE PASSED.
LEMME HELP YOU BRING HIM INSIDE.
A WILY COCKSUCKER, HUH?
WAITED TILL I GOT HIM OFF THE SLED, HUH?
I WOULD HAVE LET HIM LAY IN STATE,
BUT I NEED THE ROOM FOR MY WHORES.
THANKS FOR SEEING HIM THROUGH.
ARE YOU GONNA PROBE IN HIS NOGGIN NOW TO SEE WHAT WENT AMISS?
NO, NOT TONIGHT.
TONIGHT, I PLAN TO DRINK IN.
( panting )
ANNOUNCING YOUR PLANS
IS A GOOD WAY TO HEAR GOD LAUGH.
( bugle playing )
( thumps )
I TOLD HIM, BUT WE AIN'T HAD TIME TO ACT ON YOUR REQUEST YET.
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S BEEN A BUSY NIGHT.
- BULLOCK, WHAT IS IT?
- WE NEED TO TALK.
RIGHT.
YEAH, OKAY.
DOC, I'M GONNA BE A FEW MINUTES, HUH?
SEE THIS MAN GETS HIS SHINE, HUH?
COME ON.
HI, DOC.
HOW YOU DOING?
NO STIFFNESS OR NUMBNESS.
UH, LET ME SEE YOU MOVE AROUND A BIT.
THAT'LL GIVE YOU A SHINE.
HOW DO I LOOK?
HOW DO YOU FEEL'S THE GODDAMN QUESTION.
I FEEL GOOD.
WELL, GOOD.
HEY, DOC.
GIVE ME A WHIRL.
NO, NO.
COME ON, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, I WON'T, UM-
- NO.
THERE'S A BLOOD STAIN ON YOUR FLOOR.
YEAH, I'M...
I'M GONNA GET TO THAT.
CROOK'S FORCES IN FULL RETREAT.
TAKING MRS. GARRET'S FATHER WITH 'EM.
UP AND ABOUT SO QUICK.
- HE'S SLUNG OVER A MULE.
- ALIVE, IS MY POINT.
DORITY GIVE ME TO UNDERSTAND
YOU'D JUST AS SOON AS SEEN HIM DEAD.
IF THAT MAN COMES BACK TO THE CAMP,
HE'D BE MY PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH.
THE WAY YOU AND HICKOK DEALT WITH NED MASON.
NO.
I'LL BE THE FUCKING SHERIFF.
STARTING WHEN?
STARTING NOW.
- YOU HAVE THE TIN?
- I DO.
PRODUCE IT.
ON THE TIT.
I KNOW WHERE IT GOES.
HUZZAH.
( bugle playing )
( drums playing )
HEY, GENERAL!
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
WOW-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH!
WOOH!
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER SPOKEN TO HER ONCE SINCE SHE COME TO CAMP.
YOU RECKON THAT'S ANOTHER REASON NOT TO KILL HER OLD MAN,
BESIDES WHATEVER'S GOING ON BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.
YEAH.
ANYWAYS, SHERIFF,
I'M GONNA WALK PAST THAT BLOOD STAIN THAT MYSTERIOUSLY APPEARED
AND GO OVERSEE MY BUSINESS INTERESTS.
TAKE YOUR TIME.
( piano playing )
SAY "I'M AS NIMBLE AS A FOREST CREATURE."
YOU'RE AS NIMBLE AS A FOREST CREATURE.
NO, SAY IT ABOUT YOURSELF.
I'M AS NIMBLE AS A FOREST CREATURE.
( giggling )
* WHEN WE SEE JESUS, COMING IN GLORY *
* WHEN HE COMES FROM HIS HOME IN THE SKY *
* THEN WE SHALL MEET HIM IN THAT BRIGHT MANSION *
* WE'LL UNDERSTAND IT ALL, BY AND BY *
* FARTHER ALONG WE WILL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT *
* FARTHER ALONG WE WILL UNDERSTAND WHY *

If you got a different Idea, you can ride ahead.
Nah.
Let's take the cocksucker To yankton.

Meaning all that whore's been Telling me the last 10 fucking days
About seeing the widow taking the Dope, and your own fucking assurances,
You verify that she's loaded personally - you're both full of shit.
I checked in On the woman daily.
If I was fooled, perhaps i've Chosen simplemindedness, al,
Over realizing A certain friend
Has used me as an instrument Of purposes he concealed.
Say what You're gonna say,
Or prepare for eternal Fucking silence.
I don't believe You commissioned me
To make an offer On the widow's claim
To keep the regulators Off you, al.
I think someone found Something out there you want.
Assume you ain't Been privy
To the ins and outs Of that matter
For the sake Of fucking conversation, huh?
I mean, Was I asleep, e.b.,
When you and me Declared undying loyalty
And full faith Mutual disclosure
About every fucking detail Of every fucking move
- we were ever gonna fucking make together?
- you used me as a pawn, al.
And you fucked up the game is The central fucking present issue.
We agreed on 2,000.
You want A fucking percentage instead?
Is that such An inconceivable proposition?
- yeah, you got a percentage, e.b. - how big?
Two percent of the first Million, half a percent after.
You wanna feel A damp palm, al,
Select either Of these hands.
Just get to the funeral, E.b. Go to 20 if you have to.
Just get that Fucking claim.
20 if I have to.
My word.
What a handsome man.
Wish i Could tell you I recognize him.
Thank you anyway.

Marta.
- and on the great day...
- mama.
- his father will take him into it.
- papa.
As he will all who Confess his son savior
From wherever We may be put to rest.
Our hymn is "a mighty fortress."
* a mighty fortress Is our god * * a bulwark Never failing... *
- my sympathies, madam, - * our helper...
But, my own Requirements force me
To ignore What's seemly.
I must decide where To place my capital.
Might raising my offer To say, $19,500, uh,
Prompt you To an immediate answer?
- no, mr.
Farnum.
- * doth seek to work us woe * * lord sabbath, His name *

I'll see him Some other time.
Come on.
* on earth is not His equal... *
I will require a decision Within 24 hours-
Please, stop speaking To me, mr.
Farnum.
* did we in our own Strength confide * * our striving Would be losing *

I hope you ain't gived up on That little runt of a girl, al.
Oh, do you worry For her, dan?
Wandering the muck Of our thoroughfare,
Her tiny self all but Swallowed up in horseshit?
Hey, kid!
Come here.
- yes, sir?
- stand with us here a second.
What are- What are we doing?
Waiting.
Al: and out the door he'll go,
And prompt as A swiss fucking timepiece
Three big-tittied whores will now Emerge from behind that screen.
He lines 'em up At two-foot intervals,
Smock tops down,
And all but Sprints past 'em,
Giving their Titties a lick.
And if he misses A titty,
Does not let himself Retrace his steps.
- don't tell me.
- yeah, and then he goes on his way home,
Relieved for the day.
What's Your name?
It's miles, huh?
- miles, yeah.
- yeah.
Strange, huh, miles?
But something you gotta Know about specialists.
They pay a premium
And they never Cause fucking trouble.
I sometimes imagine in my declining Years running a small joint
In manchester, england, catering To specialists exclusive.
And to let 'em know they're amongst Their own, i'll operate from the corner,
Hanging upside down Like a fucking bat, hmm?
- oh, we're not such bad sorts here, huh, miles?
- no, sir.
So do you wanna ask your sister If she'd like to reconsider, hmm?
- you don'treally mean that, mr.
Swearengen.
- of course I don't mean it.
How dare you suggest i'd Mean a thing like that, huh?
I did my part.
Raised our offer to 20 and Demanded answer within the day.
But what, You cocksucker?
Complications have ensued:
Bullock's come back.
I expect she'll wanna Take counsel with him.
Tell the whore I wanna see her.
And I trust this doesn't Alter our agreement.
I trust you know 2% of Nothing's fucking nothing.
That fella from montana
I knew to trust won't be Able to assay your claim.
- I see.
- we'll engage someone local, and i'll keep an eye on him.
As i've decided to stay In camp, mr.
Bullock,
At least For the near term,
I hope you'll feel absolved Of those responsibilities
Towards my interest that you Undertook at mr.
Hickok's request.
I prefer to see 'Em through.
They're properly mine.
I even feel marginally Capable of shouldering them
And I certainly realize That you and mr.

Have responsibilities Of your own.
Are you firing me, Mrs. Garret?
I'm offering you Absolution.
Otherwise I'm staying on.
I'm so sorry You were hurt.
So, how hard are they Coming at you to sell?
I could confide
That in an effort To blur my judgment,
Mr. Swearengen Engaged intermediaries
To indulge me With opium.
But that would entail Acknowledging that
I've had a weakness In that direction.
Uh...
More appropriately, Uh, I could add
At the graveyard Mr. Farnum raised his offer
$7,500,
Presumably also on Mr. Swearengen's instruction,
And set a 24-hour Limit to my reply.
Under the circumstances, i'd Say that's coming pretty hard.
Please forgive me for making You uncomfortable, mr.
Bullock.
I had better manners Before I began to abstain.
That's all right.
Anyways, are you at risk For the smallpox?
I was inoculated In new york city.
The child whose life you saved Presumably has not been,
But I assume she's Safer under my care
Than traveling in a covered Wagon with strangers.
Anyways, i'll Line up the assayer.

Congratulations, sir, On your advanced thinking.
Al wants you, Trixie.
Stickler for Self-delivered messages.
Our dad ain't here.
I know it, Even if my brother don't.
Maybe he never even Tried to get here.
Or maybe he did try To get here and couldn't,
Maybe something Happened to him.
There's so many ways It could be, flora,
It's not much point Deciding which it was.
He'd never think that, Though, my brother.
Must be how He needs to do.
I ain't a virgin-
If you wanna know that.
I had a boyfriend In buffalo.
Well, was you upset To have to leave him?
- what do you think?
- I don't know.
I was upset.
At the same time he was A stupid son of a bitch.
And rough.
Here.
You can't tell My brother about him.
He'd make it back to buffalo And shoot lewis in the head.
All that way in defense Of your virtue?
That's more trouble Than I ever took with it.
Cy.
Lazarus risen.
Look at you, You son of a gun.
Hello, cy.

Oh, and we ain't Getting nothing going.
All I come back for, Cy, was my things,
And you tossed Them too.
Why don't you take this and get Yourself outta that clown outfit?
Once you've cooled off A little,
Think how you'd have done Different when somebody showed up
In the shape you was in and My responsibilities to meet.
Better than to throw him In the woods to fucking die?
Then don't think About nothing, andy.
Use the money For a whore
And a toot and go join The fucking circus.
Did you Turn her out?
Her brother's Gonna be a problem.
Fuck her brother.
We'll handle the brother
If we have to kill The cocksucker.
That's an interesting Piece of strange.
( knocking )
Ain't you a picture?
- what is it?
- hmm?
Oh, am I detaining you In some way?
Am I fucking Imposing?
Mrs. Garret's To sit down with bullock.
I thought you'd Want me over there.
Oh yeah, so you can bring me A full and fair report, huh?
But will the widow have her Wits about her, trixie, huh?
Or will they be Passing the opium pipe
Like heathens between 'em, Her and fucking bullock, hmm?
- what're you pissed off for?
- I ain't pissed off.
I'm in fucking Wonderment.
I'm waiting to be kept happy By the next fucking fairy tale.
Do you want me Back at the hotel
Or do you wanna Do something to me?
Now why would I want you To go back there, huh?
Or rely on anything You said transpired
After you lied About her taking dope, huh?
Her being high...
Wasn't gonna have Nothing to do
With whether or not She sold you that claim,
And she wanted To get off the dope.
And that little one needs Someone to care for her...
And maybe get her The fuck outta here.
And I knew it Wasn't gonna be me.
So you want me Back over there
And to tell you what They fucking decide?
Or do you wanna rip My fucking guts out?
You get Back there quick.
Don't kid Yourself, trixie.
Don't get A mistaken idea.
Mr. Utter.
This is where bill Got killed, huh?
Uh...
I'll be sorry about that For as long as I live.
Can you tell me About it?
Yeah.
It- it was About sun-up
Over at that Bella union joint,
Mr. Hickok plum Gutted mccall at draw.
And now here mr.
Hickok Was at poker again.
Say a couple hours Of daylight left
And in come that Coward mccall.
Walked up on him And shot him in the head.
Bill never know When he come in.
Uh, those of us That did,
We didn't have no inkling Of what he intended.
He just murdered him, Right where he sat.
Man:
If I may, sir...
This is here where
Wild bill was sitting when Mccall entered from the front,
Approached the table, Causing no apprehension
'Cause he had often Frequented the game.
Of a sudden, Mccall produced a revolver
And shouting "take that, Damn you!" he fired.
Muzzle couldn't have been three Inches from wild bill's head.
Now i'm told that hickok Fell dead immediately,
But I won't Testify to it,
Because the bullet, after it Passed through wild bill's brain,
Struck me In my right wrist,
And I lost several seconds to Pain before regaining my senses.
Sir, you have my word As eyewitness to the rest,
And I suppose this wound As added proof for the doctors
They feared crippled me In the hand I use to write.
I will take the murderer's Bullet to my grave.
Thanks.
Aces over eights,
As I just now recall.
That is the hand That wild bill had.
Sure, captain.
Sure.
You like how That falls?
Sure.
- do you like it, flora?
- why not?
I'd prefer you happy, Honey, but if you can't be,
You need to pretend at it Better than you're doing
Or you're gonna be Hungry and cold
And getting done to you For nothing outside
What you'd have made money To live on and save up besides
If you acted The part in here.
I thought I only had to act it With them that wanna stick it in me.
You never know who That might be, flora.
There you go.
I prefer you Happy.
Or at least Pretending better?
I think He's dead, doc.
Could you tell the litter bearers not to Make so much of getting this one outta here?
- has young joey gone to dust?
- yeah.
As flesh must,
To be restored By the savior's return.
Oh, mr.
Bullock is Back among us,
And also, Also mr.
Utter.
Does charlie Know about bill?
They were together, Mr. Bullock and he.
They'd captured Jack mccall.
I hope that's only the beginning Of what they fucking did to him.
- gave him over to the federal authorities.
- gave him over?
- rendered unto caesar.
- jesus christ.
Mr.- mr.
Bullock was Struck by an indian's axe.
Marked like the first-born Of adam and eve.
- are you drunk?
- no.
( groaning )
- what the fuck is that?
- he's all right.
All right, reverend.
All right, reverend.
All right.
You're all right, Reverend.
All right.
He marks us sinful
And forgiven By confession.
All right.
He has told us and Shown us.
He has told me.
All right.
You listen to me now, Reverend.
You are goddamn exhausted,
And you give yourself No respite.
These seizures May owe something to that,
But it also Wouldn't surprise me
If you had a lesion In your goddamn head,
And that's what's Giving you the seizures
And generating your chats With the goddamn divinity.
No goddamn offense intended.
- none taken, sir.
- now get outta here,
- and get yourself some rest!
- jane: go on, reverend.
Doc's tired too,
The only reason he's Talking so fucking harsh.
Could not the lesion be
The instrument of god's Instructive intention, doctor,
If I am so afflicted?
Well, of course it could,
His ways not being ours And so forth.
But could he not, Reverend, just want you
Getting out of here and getting Yourself some goddamn rest?
- flora: you have to go now.
- we don't have todo nothing,
I'd pay the same price Just to sit with you.
My brother works in this place up Here, and he keeps a hard watch.
If you wanna stick it In me tomorrow,
You better let me Go in by myself.
- what time are you gonna start?
- 11:00, I guess.
I'll be receiving Around noon.
All right, flora.
Here's a dollar anyway.
You're swell.
Evening.
Evening, miss.
- you're early.
- yes.
- I guess no luck finding your dad.
- no, no luck.
I knew you would've had a cheerier Look on your face if you had.
Let me get you a place to sit away From these rough sons of bitches.
Hey!
Do your drinking at the bar Or get the fuck out of here!
You have a seat here.
I'll get you a beverage.
Do you Want a soft cider or a sarsaparilla?
- cider if it's not a trouble.
- soft cider.
Did she find her dad?
Her chances of finding her Dad are greater than yours
Of walking out Of this door upright,
Unless you shut Your fucking mouth.
You got it?
Swearengen's had his hand On the tiller
Far as getting dealing With this epidemic.
- is that so?
- yeah, the dead don't drink or chase women
Must be his thinking On that subject.
That indian fought Like hell.
I'd guess you did too.
Charlie figured out How it must have been.
The indian had to kill me For coming on the burial place,
And maybe it had been me, too, That killed his friend,
Cut his friend's head off so he Wouldn't have eyes to see the sunset
All those years He'd be lying there dead.
So he had to kill me For that too.
And he couldn't Before he'd laid hands on me
Or the killing Wouldn't be honorable.
We fought like fucking hell, I'll tell you that much,
And I never once had The upper-hand.
It just happened out The way it happened out.
He was just trying to live, Same as me,
And do honor to his friend, and make Some fucking sense out of things.
And we wind up that way, And I wind up
After beating him till I couldn't recognize his face.
For christ's sake!
That indian saved Jack mccall's life,
- i'll tell you that fucking much.
- not for long.
Brian macdonald's not coming.
I want his recommendation
Who should assay That widow's claim.
- whose?
- swearengen's.
Shit, seth.
Get his opinion, too, who should Guard that henhouse we're gonna build.
So...
Are you okay?
- yes, and you?
- yes.
They're nice here.
And mr.
Swearengen, He's funny as all get-out.
So what place would make A better score?
Where i'm working.
But why not Take 'em both?
- could we have a private talk?
- sure we can.
- should I be armed?
- where do you wanna talk?
Come here.
What do you Think of that?
I think that son of a bitch better Stop looking evil at that little girl.
- so was it mccall who improved your appearance?
- no.
Whoever got the job done, i Hope you gave as good as you got.
It's good to have you back, With me being superstitious
And all hell breaking loose When you left.
I'm here to talk About mrs.
Garret.
They planted her husband This morning?
I wrote a man about Coming to assay her claim,
- but he can't make it.
- plenty of local alternatives.
I want you To nominate someone.
Do you?
So if any way His work was mistaken,
I'd be coming after you.
- you would?
- yeah.
Since I got nothing to do With the venture,
What if I decline to make The recommendation?
Then you better hope whoever I find does his job right,
'Cause i'm still Holding you accountable.
I ain't involved.
E.b. Farnum offered On her claim.
Farnum's your water-boy and I know What you've been trying to do to her.
So here you come In all nobility...
Threatening me With a dire result
If the property Of that widow's husband
Thought worthless From when it sold,
Turns out not To be pinched out.
You and I know how it is, Mr. Swearengen.
- how what is?
- she gets a square shake,
Or I come for you.
What if I come for you?
Are you ready for that?
I guess i'd better be.
Then close your fucking store, 'Cause being ready for me
Will take care Of your waking hours
And you better have someone to hand the Task off to when you close your eyes.
We understand each other.
Man:
Al!
Al!
Jesus fucking christ!
Walk right past me, Your holiness,
So I can shut My fucking office.

Anyways, people don't Scare me past speaking,
I come up here nights Tell him the fucking news.
Go ahead.
Charlie avenged Your fucking murder.
And that bullock fella was With me that you seemed to like.
Although it occurred to me to wonder Why they didn't do for the cocksucker
- right on the fucking spot.
- is that something we need to get into in front of him?
You got the biggest mouth in The territory.
You talk to him.
Tell him Whatever you want.

It don't matter, Mrs. Garret.
The point is, I gotta go back.
And you need someone To look to this child,
And with choices Bigger elsewhere
And nothing I can tell To hold you here,
Maybe you better think about Selling and getting out.
Would you wanna Take the girl and go?
Where?
- I have no people anywhere.
- you could goto new york.
I
- I could have my relatives There see you established.
What the fuck?
What would Keep you here?

Think of selling.
If you took her away, You could hear her say it.

* ON EARTH IS NOT HIS EQUAL... *
I WILL REQUIRE A DECISION WITHIN 24 HOURS--
PLEASE, STOP SPEAKING TO ME, MR. FARNUM.
* DID WE IN OUR OWN STRENGTH CONFIDE *
* OUR STRIVING WOULD BE LOSING *
* WERE NOT THE RIGHT MAN BY OUR SIDE... *
* THE MAN OF GOD'S OWN CHOOSING. *
I HOPE YOU AIN'T GIVED UP ON THAT LITTLE RUNT OF A GIRL, AL.
OH, DO YOU WORRY FOR HER, DAN?
WANDERING THE MUCK OF OUR THOROUGHFARE,
HER TINY SELF ALL BUT SWALLOWED UP IN HORSESHIT?
HEY, KID!
COME HERE.
- YES, SIR?
- STAND WITH US HERE A SECOND.
WHAT ARE-- WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WAITING.
Al:
AND OUT THE DOOR HE'LL GO,
AND PROMPT AS A SWISS FUCKING TIMEPIECE
THREE BIG-TITTIED WHORES WILL NOW EMERGE FROM BEHIND THAT SCREEN.
HE LINES 'EM UP AT TWO-FOOT INTERVALS,
SMOCK TOPS DOWN,
AND ALL BUT SPRINTS PAST 'EM,
GIVING THEIR TITTIES A LICK.
AND IF HE MISSES A TITTY,
DOES NOT LET HIMSELF RETRACE HIS STEPS.
- DON'T TELL ME.
- YEAH, AND THEN HE GOES ON HIS WAY HOME,
RELIEVED FOR THE DAY.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
IT'S MILES, HUH?
- MILES, YEAH.
- YEAH.
STRANGE, HUH, MILES?
BUT SOMETHING YOU GOTTA KNOW ABOUT SPECIALISTS.
THEY PAY A PREMIUM
AND THEY NEVER CAUSE FUCKING TROUBLE.
I SOMETIMES IMAGINE IN MY DECLINING YEARS RUNNING A SMALL JOINT
IN MANCHESTER, ENGLAND, CATERING TO SPECIALISTS EXCLUSIVE.
AND TO LET 'EM KNOW THEY'RE AMONGST THEIR OWN, I'LL OPERATE FROM THE CORNER,
HANGING UPSIDE DOWN LIKE A FUCKING BAT, HMM?
- OH, WE'RE NOT SUCH BAD SORTS HERE, HUH, MILES?
- NO, SIR.
SO DO YOU WANNA ASK YOUR SISTER IF SHE'D LIKE TO RECONSIDER, HMM?
- YOU DON'TREALLY MEAN THAT, MR. SWEARENGEN.
- OF COURSE I DON'T MEAN IT.
HOW DARE YOU SUGGEST I'D MEAN A THING LIKE THAT, HUH?
I DID MY PART.
RAISED OUR OFFER TO 20 AND DEMANDED ANSWER WITHIN THE DAY.
BUT WHAT, YOU COCKSUCKER?
COMPLICATIONS HAVE ENSUED:
BULLOCK'S COME BACK.
I EXPECT SHE'LL WANNA TAKE COUNSEL WITH HIM.
TELL THE WHORE I WANNA SEE HER.
AND I TRUST THIS DOESN'T ALTER OUR AGREEMENT.
I TRUST YOU KNOW 2% OF NOTHING'S FUCKING NOTHING.
THAT FELLA FROM MONTANA
I KNEW TO TRUST WON'T BE ABLE TO ASSAY YOUR CLAIM.
- I SEE.
- WE'LL ENGAGE SOMEONE LOCAL, AND I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
AS I'VE DECIDED TO STAY IN CAMP, MR. BULLOCK,
AT LEAST FOR THE NEAR TERM,
I HOPE YOU'LL FEEL ABSOLVED OF THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES
TOWARDS MY INTEREST THAT YOU UNDERTOOK AT MR. HICKOK'S REQUEST.
I PREFER TO SEE 'EM THROUGH.
THEY'RE PROPERLY MINE.
I EVEN FEEL MARGINALLY CAPABLE OF SHOULDERING THEM
AND I CERTAINLY REALIZE THAT YOU AND MR. STAR
HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF YOUR OWN.
ARE YOU FIRING ME, MRS. GARRET?
I'M OFFERING YOU ABSOLUTION.
OTHERWISE I'M STAYING ON.
I'M SO SORRY YOU WERE HURT.
SO, HOW HARD ARE THEY COMING AT YOU TO SELL?
I COULD CONFIDE
THAT IN AN EFFORT TO BLUR MY JUDGMENT,
MR. SWEARENGEN ENGAGED INTERMEDIARIES
TO INDULGE ME WITH OPIUM.
BUT THAT WOULD ENTAIL ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
I'VE HAD A WEAKNESS IN THAT DIRECTION.
UH...
MORE APPROPRIATELY, UH, I COULD ADD
AT THE GRAVEYARD MR. FARNUM RAISED HIS OFFER
$7,500,
PRESUMABLY ALSO ON MR. SWEARENGEN'S INSTRUCTION,
AND SET A 24-HOUR LIMIT TO MY REPLY.
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I'D SAY THAT'S COMING PRETTY HARD.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR MAKING YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, MR. BULLOCK.
I HAD BETTER MANNERS BEFORE I BEGAN TO ABSTAIN.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
ANYWAYS, ARE YOU AT RISK FOR THE SMALLPOX?
I WAS INOCULATED IN NEW YORK CITY.
THE CHILD WHOSE LIFE YOU SAVED PRESUMABLY HAS NOT BEEN,
BUT I ASSUME SHE'S SAFER UNDER MY CARE
THAN TRAVELING IN A COVERED WAGON WITH STRANGERS.
ANYWAYS, I'LL LINE UP THE ASSAYER.
THANK YOU.
YOU ARE CHANGED.
YOU SEEM TO BE TOO.
OUR STOCK'S DEPLETED, BUT WE ARE OFFERING A 100% DISCOUNT
ON ANY ITEM THAT CATCHES YOUR EYE.
I'VE GOT MONEY.
OUR SPECIAL GET- ACQUAINTED-WITH-THOSE-
WE'D-LIKE-TO-GET- ACQUAINTED-WITH SALE.
MR. UTTER.
I BROUGHT THESE PICKAXES FOR YOU TO SELL.
THERE'S TWO SIFTERS ON THAT BLACK CAYUSE OUT THERE.
MIGHTY GRATEFUL, SIR.
YOU GOT THIS PLACE JUST ABOUT BUILT, DON'T YOU?
SAVING THE LAST MASTER-STROKES FOR SETH.
OH, HELLO.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.
HELLO.
HEY, THAT'S THAT LITTLE GIRL, ISN'T IT?
TAKING CARE OF HER FOR MRS. GARRET.
AS MUCH AS SHE FAVORS YOU, SHE COULD BE YOURS.
I LOST THE RECEIPTS FOR MY COSTS.
MAYBE WHILE YOU WAS BUSY SAVING MY PARTNER'S LIFE.
LET ME GET THESE SIFTERS FOR YOU.
SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE THOSE ACCOUNTS ADD UP.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD ME INSIDE
THANKING YOU FOR HELPING MY FRIEND.
I HEARD YOU.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M SORRY YOU LOST YOURS.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
WELCOME BACK, MR. UTTER.
WE'VE HAD A MILD INCREASE IN RATES,
BUT I DO HAVE A ROOM AVAILABLE.
I'LL SEE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT, MR. FARNUM?
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR TRIXIE
THAT'S LOOKING TO THAT ORPHAN CHILD.
- SHE'S TO SEE HER LONGER-TERM EMPLOYER.
- I'LL TELL HER.
YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?
I KNOW SHE WORKS AT THE GEM.
AND EVEN SO, ADMIT HER TO YOUR TRADE AT PUBLIC HOURS.
CONGRATULATIONS, SIR, ON YOUR ADVANCED THINKING.
AL WANTS YOU, TRIXIE.
STICKLER FOR SELF-DELIVERED MESSAGES.
OUR DAD AIN'T HERE.
I KNOW IT, EVEN IF MY BROTHER DON'T.
MAYBE HE NEVER EVEN TRIED TO GET HERE.
OR MAYBE HE DID TRY TO GET HERE AND COULDN'T,
MAYBE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM.
THERE'S SO MANY WAYS IT COULD BE, FLORA,
IT'S NOT MUCH POINT DECIDING WHICH IT WAS.
HE'D NEVER THINK THAT, THOUGH, MY BROTHER.
MUST BE HOW HE NEEDS TO DO.
I AIN'T A VIRGIN--
IF YOU WANNA KNOW THAT.
I HAD A BOYFRIEND IN BUFFALO.
WELL, WAS YOU UPSET TO HAVE TO LEAVE HIM?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS UPSET.
AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A STUPID SON OF A BITCH.
AND ROUGH.
HERE.
YOU CAN'T TELL MY BROTHER ABOUT HIM.
HE'D MAKE IT BACK TO BUFFALO AND SHOOT LEWIS IN THE HEAD.
ALL THAT WAY IN DEFENSE OF YOUR VIRTUE?
THAT'S MORE TROUBLE THAN I EVER TOOK WITH IT.
CY.
LAZARUS RISEN.
LOOK AT YOU, YOU SON OF A GUN.
HELLO, CY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, ANDY.
DON'T BE AFRAID TO SHAKE WITH ME, EDDIE.
I AIN'T CONTAGIOUS NO MORE.
HIGHLY BECOMING OUTFIT.
I'M HERE FOR MY BELONGINGS.
LOOK...
THEY'RE GONE, ANDY.
MEASURES TO STOP THE SPREAD.
AH HELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU'RE WELL.
I'LL FRONT YOU WHATEVER YOU NEED.
LET'S GET SOMETHING GOING, HMM?
- ANDY?
- IN THE FLESH, SWEETHEART.
- WHICH AIN'T MUCH TO LOOK AT.
- YOU MADE IT, ANDY.
OH, AND WE AIN'T GETTING NOTHING GOING.
ALL I COME BACK FOR, CY, WAS MY THINGS,
AND YOU TOSSED THEM TOO.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THIS AND GET YOURSELF OUTTA THAT CLOWN OUTFIT?
ONCE YOU'VE COOLED OFF A LITTLE,
THINK HOW YOU'D HAVE DONE DIFFERENT WHEN SOMEBODY SHOWED UP
IN THE SHAPE YOU WAS IN AND MY RESPONSIBILITIES TO MEET.
BETTER THAN TO THROW HIM IN THE WOODS TO FUCKING DIE?
THEN DON'T THINK ABOUT NOTHING, ANDY.
USE THE MONEY FOR A WHORE
AND A TOOT AND GO JOIN THE FUCKING CIRCUS.
DID YOU TURN HER OUT?
HER BROTHER'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM.
FUCK HER BROTHER.
WE'LL HANDLE THE BROTHER
IF WE HAVE TO KILL THE COCKSUCKER.
THAT'S AN INTERESTING PIECE OF STRANGE.
( knocking )
AIN'T YOU A PICTURE?
- WHAT IS IT?
- HMM?
OH, AM I DETAINING YOU IN SOME WAY?
AM I FUCKING IMPOSING?
MRS. GARRET'S TO SIT DOWN WITH BULLOCK.
I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT ME OVER THERE.
OH YEAH, SO YOU CAN BRING ME A FULL AND FAIR REPORT, HUH?
BUT WILL THE WIDOW HAVE HER WITS ABOUT HER, TRIXIE, HUH?
OR WILL THEY BE PASSING THE OPIUM PIPE
LIKE HEATHENS BETWEEN 'EM, HER AND FUCKING BULLOCK, HMM?
- WHAT'RE YOU PISSED OFF FOR?
- I AIN'T PISSED OFF.
I'M IN FUCKING WONDERMENT.
I'M WAITING TO BE KEPT HAPPY BY THE NEXT FUCKING FAIRY TALE.
DO YOU WANT ME BACK AT THE HOTEL
OR DO YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING TO ME?
NOW WHY WOULD I WANT YOU TO GO BACK THERE, HUH?
OR RELY ON ANYTHING YOU SAID TRANSPIRED
AFTER YOU LIED ABOUT HER TAKING DOPE, HUH?
HER BEING HIGH...
WASN'T GONNA HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHETHER OR NOT SHE SOLD YOU THAT CLAIM,
AND SHE WANTED TO GET OFF THE DOPE.
AND THAT LITTLE ONE NEEDS SOMEONE TO CARE FOR HER...
AND MAYBE GET HER THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.
AND I KNEW IT WASN'T GONNA BE ME.
SO YOU WANT ME BACK OVER THERE
AND TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY FUCKING DECIDE?
OR DO YOU WANNA RIP MY FUCKING GUTS OUT?
YOU GET BACK THERE QUICK.
DON'T KID YOURSELF, TRIXIE.
DON'T GET A MISTAKEN IDEA.
MR. UTTER.
THIS IS WHERE BILL GOT KILLED, HUH?
UH...
I'LL BE SORRY ABOUT THAT FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE.
CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT?
YEAH.
IT-
- IT WAS ABOUT SUN-UP
OVER AT THAT BELLA UNION JOINT,
MR. HICKOK PLUM GUTTED McCALL AT DRAW.
AND NOW HERE MR. HICKOK WAS AT POKER AGAIN.
SAY A COUPLE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT
AND IN COME THAT COWARD McCALL.
WALKED UP ON HIM AND SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD.
BILL NEVER KNOW WHEN HE COME IN.
UH, THOSE OF US THAT DID,
WE DIDN'T HAVE NO INKLING OF WHAT HE INTENDED.
HE JUST MURDERED HIM, RIGHT WHERE HE SAT.
Man:
IF I MAY, SIR...
THIS IS HERE WHERE
WILD BILL WAS SITTING WHEN McCALL ENTERED FROM THE FRONT,
APPROACHED THE TABLE, CAUSING NO APPREHENSION
'CAUSE HE HAD OFTEN FREQUENTED THE GAME.
OF A SUDDEN, McCALL PRODUCED A REVOLVER
AND SHOUTING "TAKE THAT, DAMN YOU!" HE FIRED.
MUZZLE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THREE INCHES FROM WILD BILL'S HEAD.
NOW I'M TOLD THAT HICKOK FELL DEAD IMMEDIATELY,
BUT I WON'T TESTIFY TO IT,
BECAUSE THE BULLET, AFTER IT PASSED THROUGH WILD BILL'S BRAIN,
STRUCK ME IN MY RIGHT WRIST,
AND I LOST SEVERAL SECONDS TO PAIN BEFORE REGAINING MY SENSES.
SIR, YOU HAVE MY WORD AS EYEWITNESS TO THE REST,
AND I SUPPOSE THIS WOUND AS ADDED PROOF FOR THE DOCTORS
THEY FEARED CRIPPLED ME IN THE HAND I USE TO WRITE.
I WILL TAKE THE MURDERER'S BULLET TO MY GRAVE.
THANKS.
ACES OVER EIGHTS,
AS I JUST NOW RECALL.
THAT IS THE HAND THAT WILD BILL HAD.
SURE, CAPTAIN.
SURE.
YOU LIKE HOW THAT FALLS?
SURE.
- DO YOU LIKE IT, FLORA?
- WHY NOT?
I'D PREFER YOU HAPPY, HONEY, BUT IF YOU CAN'T BE,
YOU NEED TO PRETEND AT IT BETTER THAN YOU'RE DOING
OR YOU'RE GONNA BE HUNGRY AND COLD
AND GETTING DONE TO YOU FOR NOTHING OUTSIDE
WHAT YOU'D HAVE MADE MONEY TO LIVE ON AND SAVE UP BESIDES
IF YOU ACTED THE PART IN HERE.
I THOUGHT I ONLY HAD TO ACT IT WITH THEM THAT WANNA STICK IT IN ME.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO THAT MIGHT BE, FLORA.
THERE YOU GO.
I PREFER YOU HAPPY.
OR AT LEAST PRETENDING BETTER?
I THINK HE'S DEAD, DOC.
COULD YOU TELL THE LITTER BEARERS NOT TO MAKE SO MUCH OF GETTING THIS ONE OUTTA HERE?
- HAS YOUNG JOEY GONE TO DUST?
- YEAH.
AS FLESH MUST,
TO BE RESTORED BY THE SAVIOR'S RETURN.
OH, MR. BULLOCK IS BACK AMONG US,
AND ALSO, ALSO MR. UTTER.
DOES CHARLIE KNOW ABOUT BILL?
THEY WERE TOGETHER, MR. BULLOCK AND HE.
THEY'D CAPTURED JACK McCALL.
I HOPE THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING OF WHAT THEY FUCKING DID TO HIM.
- GAVE HIM OVER TO THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES.
- GAVE HIM OVER?
- RENDERED UNTO CAESAR.
- JESUS CHRIST.
MR.-
- MR. BULLOCK WAS STRUCK BY AN INDIAN'S AXE.
MARKED LIKE THE FIRST-BORN OF ADAM AND EVE.
- ARE YOU DRUNK?
- NO.
( groaning )
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?
- HE'S ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, REVEREND.
ALL RIGHT, REVEREND.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, REVEREND.
ALL RIGHT.
HE MARKS US SINFUL
AND FORGIVEN BY CONFESSION.
ALL RIGHT.
HE HAS TOLD US AND SHOWN US.
HE HAS TOLD ME.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU LISTEN TO ME NOW, REVEREND.
YOU ARE GODDAMN EXHAUSTED,
AND YOU GIVE YOURSELF NO RESPITE.
THESE SEIZURES MAY OWE SOMETHING TO THAT,
BUT IT ALSO WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME
IF YOU HAD A LESION IN YOUR GODDAMN HEAD,
AND THAT'S WHAT'S GIVING YOU THE SEIZURES
AND GENERATING YOUR CHATS WITH THE GODDAMN DIVINITY.
NO GODDAMN OFFENSE INTENDED.
- NONE TAKEN, SIR.
- NOW GET OUTTA HERE,
- AND GET YOURSELF SOME REST!
- Jane:
GO ON, REVEREND.
DOC'S TIRED TOO,
THE ONLY REASON HE'S TALKING SO FUCKING HARSH.
COULD NOT THE LESION BE
THE INSTRUMENT OF GOD'S INSTRUCTIVE INTENTION, DOCTOR,
IF I AM SO AFFLICTED?
WELL, OF COURSE IT COULD,
HIS WAYS NOT BEING OURS AND SO FORTH.
BUT COULD HE NOT, REVEREND, JUST WANT YOU
GETTING OUT OF HERE AND GETTING YOURSELF SOME GODDAMN REST?
- Flora:
YOU HAVE TO GO NOW.
- WE DON'T HAVE TODO NOTHING,
I'D PAY THE SAME PRICE JUST TO SIT WITH YOU.
MY BROTHER WORKS IN THIS PLACE UP HERE, AND HE KEEPS A HARD WATCH.
IF YOU WANNA STICK IT IN ME TOMORROW,
YOU BETTER LET ME GO IN BY MYSELF.
- WHAT TIME ARE YOU GONNA START?
- 11:00, I GUESS.
I'LL BE RECEIVING AROUND NOON.
ALL RIGHT, FLORA.
HERE'S A DOLLAR ANYWAY.
YOU'RE SWELL.
EVENING.
EVENING, MISS.
- YOU'RE EARLY.
- YES.
- I GUESS NO LUCK FINDING YOUR DAD.
- NO, NO LUCK.
I KNEW YOU WOULD'VE HAD A CHEERIER LOOK ON YOUR FACE IF YOU HAD.
LET ME GET YOU A PLACE TO SIT AWAY FROM THESE ROUGH SONS OF BITCHES.
HEY!
DO YOUR DRINKING AT THE BAR OR GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
YOU HAVE A SEAT HERE.
I'LL GET YOU A BEVERAGE.
DO YOU WANT A SOFT CIDER OR A SARSAPARILLA?
- CIDER IF IT'S NOT A TROUBLE.
- SOFT CIDER.
DID SHE FIND HER DAD?
HER CHANCES OF FINDING HER DAD ARE GREATER THAN YOURS
OF WALKING OUT OF THIS DOOR UPRIGHT,
UNLESS YOU SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH.
YOU GOT IT?
SWEARENGEN'S HAD HIS HAND ON THE TILLER
FAR AS GETTING DEALING WITH THIS EPIDEMIC.
- IS THAT SO?
- YEAH, THE DEAD DON'T DRINK OR CHASE WOMEN
MUST BE HIS THINKING ON THAT SUBJECT.
THAT INDIAN FOUGHT LIKE HELL.
I'D GUESS YOU DID TOO.
CHARLIE FIGURED OUT HOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN.
THE INDIAN HAD TO KILL ME FOR COMING ON THE BURIAL PLACE,
AND MAYBE IT HAD BEEN ME, TOO, THAT KILLED HIS FRIEND,
CUT HIS FRIEND'S HEAD OFF SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE EYES TO SEE THE SUNSET
ALL THOSE YEARS HE'D BE LYING THERE DEAD.
SO HE HAD TO KILL ME FOR THAT TOO.
AND HE COULDN'T BEFORE HE'D LAID HANDS ON ME
OR THE KILLING WOULDN'T BE HONORABLE.
WE FOUGHT LIKE FUCKING HELL, I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH,
AND I NEVER ONCE HAD THE UPPER-HAND.
IT JUST HAPPENED OUT THE WAY IT HAPPENED OUT.
HE WAS JUST TRYING TO LIVE, SAME AS ME,
AND DO HONOR TO HIS FRIEND, AND MAKE SOME FUCKING SENSE OUT OF THINGS.
AND WE WIND UP THAT WAY, AND I WIND UP
AFTER BEATING HIM TILL I COULDN'T RECOGNIZE HIS FACE.
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!
THAT INDIAN SAVED JACK McCALL'S LIFE,
- I'LL TELL YOU THAT FUCKING MUCH.
- NOT FOR LONG.
BRIAN MACDONALD'S NOT COMING.
I WANT HIS RECOMMENDATION
WHO SHOULD ASSAY THAT WIDOW'S CLAIM.
- WHOSE?
- SWEARENGEN'S.
SHIT, SETH.
GET HIS OPINION, TOO, WHO SHOULD GUARD THAT HENHOUSE WE'RE GONNA BUILD.
SO...
ARE YOU OKAY?
- YES, AND YOU?
- YES.
THEY'RE NICE HERE.
AND MR. SWEARENGEN, HE'S FUNNY AS ALL GET-OUT.
SO WHAT PLACE WOULD MAKE A BETTER SCORE?
WHERE I'M WORKING.
BUT WHY NOT TAKE 'EM BOTH?
- COULD WE HAVE A PRIVATE TALK?
- SURE WE CAN.
- SHOULD I BE ARMED?
- WHERE DO YOU WANNA TALK?
COME HERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
I THINK THAT SON OF A BITCH BETTER STOP LOOKING EVIL AT THAT LITTLE GIRL.
- SO WAS IT McCALL WHO IMPROVED YOUR APPEARANCE?
- NO.
WHOEVER GOT THE JOB DONE, I HOPE YOU GAVE AS GOOD AS YOU GOT.
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, WITH ME BEING SUPERSTITIOUS
AND ALL HELL BREAKING LOOSE WHEN YOU LEFT.
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT MRS. GARRET.
THEY PLANTED HER HUSBAND THIS MORNING?
I WROTE A MAN ABOUT COMING TO ASSAY HER CLAIM,
- BUT HE CAN'T MAKE IT.
- PLENTY OF LOCAL ALTERNATIVES.
I WANT YOU TO NOMINATE SOMEONE.
DO YOU?
SO IF ANY WAY HIS WORK WAS MISTAKEN,
I'D BE COMING AFTER YOU.
- YOU WOULD?
- YEAH.
SINCE I GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VENTURE,
WHAT IF I DECLINE TO MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION?
THEN YOU BETTER HOPE WHOEVER I FIND DOES HIS JOB RIGHT,
'CAUSE I'M STILL HOLDING YOU ACCOUNTABLE.
I AIN'T INVOLVED.
E.B. FARNUM OFFERED ON HER CLAIM.
FARNUM'S YOUR WATER-BOY AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO TO HER.
SO HERE YOU COME IN ALL NOBILITY...
THREATENING ME WITH A DIRE RESULT
IF THE PROPERTY OF THAT WIDOW'S HUSBAND
THOUGHT WORTHLESS FROM WHEN IT SOLD,
TURNS OUT NOT TO BE PINCHED OUT.
YOU AND I KNOW HOW IT IS, MR. SWEARENGEN.
- HOW WHAT IS?
- SHE GETS A SQUARE SHAKE,
OR I COME FOR YOU.
WHAT IF I COME FOR YOU?
ARE YOU READY FOR THAT?
I GUESS I'D BETTER BE.
THEN CLOSE YOUR FUCKING STORE, 'CAUSE BEING READY FOR ME
WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR WAKING HOURS
AND YOU BETTER HAVE SOMEONE TO HAND THE TASK OFF TO WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES.
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.
Man:
AL!
AL!
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!
WALK RIGHT PAST ME, YOUR HOLINESS,
SO I CAN SHUT MY FUCKING OFFICE.
AL!
Dan:
GO ON!
STARE AT HER NOW!
HUH?
YOU LIKE FUCKING LITTLE GIRLS?
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LITTLE GIRL
'CAUSE SHE'S THE LAST THING YOU'RE EVER GONNA SEE.
- STARE AT HER NOW, COCKSUCKER.
- Al:
LET HIM DOWN!
LET HIM FUCKING DOWN!
( gagging )
OR SHOULD I HAVE HAD HIM HOLD HIM UP?
YOU HEAD WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE WIDOW.
OH YES, YOUR HOLINESS.
YOU HEARD ME TOO.
SO I TAKE IT THIS WAS A FAIR FUCKING FIGHT, YEAH?
Men:
YEAH!
THAT'S RIGHT!
- TWO FREE DRINKS FOR EVERYBODY.
- ( men cheering )
AND DRINKS ALL NIGHT FOR THEM THAT HELP WITH THE DISPOSAL.
Man #2:
THAT'S ME!
I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO SEE THAT.
SHUT THE FUCK UP, DAN, AND GET HER THE FUCK AWAY FROM HERE-
- NOW!
COME ON.
I'M SORRY, MR. SWEARENGEN.
I WARNED HIM NOT TO LOOK AT HER.
I WARNED HIM.
FUCKING PUSSY.
Jane:
THAT JOEY PASSED THIS AFTERNOON.
BEEN SUFFERING AWFUL.
BUT THAT FROG-LOOKING FELLOW LEFT THE TENT
THAT I FOUND UP IN THE WOODS,
LEFT THE TENT FUCKING CURE PRONOUNCED BY THE DOC HIMSELF.
AND IN THE DUMBEST LOOKING OUTFIT A GROWN MAN EVER WORE.
WHO'S THERE, GOD DAMN IT?
!
WHO THE HELL'S IT LOOK LIKE?
HOW THE FUCK DO I KNOW WHO IT FUCKING LOOKS LIKE?
IT'S DARK!
JESUS CHRIST, COME UPON A PERSON UNAWARES IN A FUCKING GRAVEYARD!
I HEARD YOU WAS BACK IN THE CAMP.
I HEARD YOU AND THAT BULLOCK GOT THE COCKSUCKER DID FOR BILL.
WAS BILL DEAD BY THE TIME YOU SAW HIM?
YEAH, HE WAS ALREADY DEAD.
WHY DID HE LET THAT SON OF A BITCH GET TO HIM?
I DON'T KNOW, CHARLIE.
ANYWAYS, PEOPLE DON'T SCARE ME PAST SPEAKING,
I COME UP HERE NIGHTS TELL HIM THE FUCKING NEWS.
GO AHEAD.
CHARLIE AVENGED YOUR FUCKING MURDER.
AND THAT BULLOCK FELLA WAS WITH ME THAT YOU SEEMED TO LIKE.
ALTHOUGH IT OCCURRED TO ME TO WONDER WHY THEY DIDN'T DO FOR THE COCKSUCKER
- RIGHT ON THE FUCKING SPOT.
- IS THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO GET INTO IN FRONT OF HIM?
YOU GOT THE BIGGEST MOUTH IN THE TERRITORY.
YOU TALK TO HIM.
TELL HIM WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I GOT THAT MAIL ROUTE IN CHEYENNE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.
I WAS BRINGING BACK SUPPLIES TO THEM HARDWARE BOYS
AND I RUN INTO THAT BULLOCK FELLA.
HE WAS OUT THERE LOOKING FOR THAT McCALL
THAT-
- THAT KILLED YOU.
AND HE RUN INTO SOME HEATHEN BOY
AND HE HAD ONE HELL OF A FIGHT.
BOY, AND HE JUST-- HE GOT--
HE GOT F--
HE GOT F-F--
FUCK.
CAN I--
CAN I TELL HIM SOME MORE TOMORROW?
SURE, WHAT THE FUCK YOU ASKING ME FOR?
I DON'T MAKE THE RULES.
WANNA GO BACK TO THE CAMP?
PLEASE.
AND WHAT MUST MR. BULLOCK HAVE BEEN THINKING
AS I INFLICTED MY PERSONAL CONFIDENCES UPON HIM?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- NOR DO I.
AT LEAST HE KEPT A DECENT PRIVACY.
I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE GEM.
HE'S WAITING FOR ME NOW TO TELL HIM
YOURS AND MR. BULLOCK'S THINKING ABOUT SELLING THE CLAIM,
AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO LIE ANYMORE.
NEXT I TELL WILL BE MY LAST.
SO I BETTER JUST GET BACK THERE.
MR. SWEARENGEN DISCOVERED OUR DECEPTION?
- YEAH.
- HOW?
- LOOKING AT YOU WALK OUT OF THE FUCKING HOTEL.
- HE DID NOT.
I WAS CAREFUL TO SEE HE WASN'T WATCHING IN THE WINDOW.
IT DON'T MATTER, MRS. GARRET.
THE POINT IS, I GOTTA GO BACK.
AND YOU NEED SOMEONE TO LOOK TO THIS CHILD,
AND WITH CHOICES BIGGER ELSEWHERE
AND NOTHING I CAN TELL TO HOLD YOU HERE,
MAYBE YOU BETTER THINK ABOUT SELLING AND GETTING OUT.
WOULD YOU WANNA TAKE THE GIRL AND GO?
WHERE?
- I HAVE NO PEOPLE ANYWHERE.
- YOU COULD GOTO NEW YORK.
I
- I COULD HAVE MY RELATIVES THERE SEE YOU ESTABLISHED.
WHAT THE FUCK?
WHAT WOULD KEEP YOU HERE?
YOU WANNA FUCK THIS MAN?
FUCK HIM, THEN THINK ABOUT THE CHILD--
DON'T USE THAT LANGUAGE WITH ME, TRIXIE, OR THAT TONE--
DON'T YOU WANNA SAY TO REMEMBER MY PLACE?
I DO, YOU RICH CUNT.
AND I'M GOING BACK TO IT.
SHE'S ABOUT TO SAY HER NAME, YOU KNOW.
SHE NAMED HER SISTERS AND HER FOLKS.
THINK OF SELLING.
IF YOU TOOK HER AWAY, YOU COULD HEAR HER SAY IT.
* OLD FRIEND
* ALL THE STORIES TO TELL *
* OLD FRIEND
* COULD YOU BID ME FAREWELL?
*
* OOH, OLD FRIEND
* IT MIGHT BE EASY FOR ANOTHER MAN TO SEE *
* OLD FOOL
* ALL THE PAIN AND THE SCARS *
* OLD FOOL
* COULD YOU LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS?
*
* OLD FOOL
* IT MIGHT BE EASY FOR ANOTHER MAN TO SEE *
* BUT I THINK YOU STILL LOOK A LOT LIKE ME. *
That's what McCall was ridin'.
All right.
Evening.
Evening back.
Look at that paint, Charlie.
I seen it.
I had a happy just like that.
Foundered.
- Makes me miserable reminiscing on it.
- Do you know the owner?
If he'd sell the horse is what he really wants to know.
Well, I don't know if he'd sell.
But the fuckin' jerk's in that bunkhouse.
- Thank you.
- Evenin'.
Jack McCall.
I'm done.
I don't wanna play no more.
Bein' a loudmouth cunt,
I guess some time since he's been here, this fella who don't wanna play no more probably spoke of killin' wild bill Hickok.
Well, we're bill Hickok's friends.
- I'm Seth bullock.
- I'm Charlie utter.
And if you got your head blown off sitting' here with your back turned, that'd be as fair a play as you gave him.
Guess you wanna soften him up some before you make your offer?
My plan is to take him to Yankton for trial.
If you got a different idea, you can ride ahead.
Nah.
Let's take the cocksucker to Yankton.
I don't know of a Henry Anderson in camp, but that don't mean there ain't.
This was took of him in the union army.
He'd be 12 years older now.
Could you let her hold it?
With so much showing, it's pretty near falling' apart.
Here.
Third from the middle.
Right uh...
right there?
Yeah.
That face don't- don't look familiar.
Thanks for lookin'.
You definite he's in these hills?
Wrote from Bismarck, said he'd send for us when he got set up.
I just gotta say it's no guarantee your dad's anywhere near this area.
And there's no fuckin' joy in me telling you that, but it's the goddamned truth and the way human beings are.
- He said he'd send for our mother and us.
- Is your mama here?
She passed.
Sorry.
Well, good luck.
Do you know of- of work for me?
- No.
- She can get work right here.
- No, sir.
- No, thank you.
- Can you push a broom?
- And I could start now.
Four bits a day.
I bet you'd like the first in advance.
If you wouldn't mind.
Same for her, as regrets for me being such a ruffian.
Here you go, honey.
If I don't fire him first, you can pick him up at 10:00.
Thank you, sir.
I'll wait for you, miles.
Find a safe place to wait, you hear?
We teach a special sweeping' technique here.
Follow her lead.
It's all right, son.
It's all right.
Um... excuse me.
I'm required to be at the graveyard.
The widow garret is laying her husband to rest.
I'd have bet a month's wages that burial would've took place in New York city, if I had a fuckin' paying' job.
The uh... wet cloth to his lips seems to give him some relief.
- All right.
- Thank you.
What do you think of my patient, doc?
You might wanna steer clear of his reflection for a while, but you're symptom-free.
You ain't contagious no more and you can't get re-infected, so them as heals under my care stay fuckin' healed.
- Thanks, doc.
I got clothes for you back here.
Hereafter in calamity, I'll be sure to call for Jane.
You gonna stick around the camp?
I believe I will for a while.
Good, 'cause I wanna monitor your activities, find out what you do that weighs so heavy on your conscience.
When I first come on you in the woods, all you could say was, "I apologize."
Before you exhibit your Johnson, I'm gonna see to this fella.
So long.
Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you.
- All right.
- You're on your own for alterations.
- Hmm.
Now I'm gonna lay this cloth on your fuckin' lips.
There's Mr. Star to collect us.
Mr. Star has been ever so attentive.
- Very considerate.
- To you.
- When we leave the hotel, my boss will be watchin'.
- Shall I reel and stagger?
I...
I know the risk lying to him has put you to.
I've
- I can't imagine why I'd make it the subject of humor.
You're feeling better.
- Am I early?
- Good morning, Mr. Star.
I'll be ready in just a moment.
- I can have a cup of coffee downstairs.
- No, not at all.
Wait, wait in here, with Trixie.
I'll just be a moment.
That widow ain't high.
Maybe waiting till after the service.
When she'd wanna get good and fucking loaded is before the fucking service, against all the fucking carrying on.
- What do you think?
- Makes sense.
Meaning all that whore's been telling me the last 10 fucking days about seeing the widow taking the dope, and your own fucking assurances, you verify that she's loaded personally - you're both full of shit.
I checked in on the woman daily.
If I was fooled, perhaps I've chosen simplemindedness, Al, over realizing a certain friend has used me as an instrument of purposes he concealed.
Say what you're gonna say, or prepare for eternal fucking silence.
I don't believe you commissioned me to make an offer on the widow's claim to keep the regulators off you, Al.
I think someone found something out there you want.
Assume you ain't been privy to the ins and outs of that matter for the sake of fucking conversation, huh?
I mean, was I asleep, e.b., when you and me declared undying loyalty and full faith mutual disclosure about every fucking detail of every fucking move
- we were ever gonna fucking make together?
- You used me as a pawn, Al.
And you fucked up the game is the central fucking present issue.
We agreed on 2,000.
You want a fucking percentage instead?
Is that such an inconceivable proposition?
- Yeah, you got a percentage, e.b.
- How big?
Two percent of the first million, half a percent after.
You wanna feel a damp palm, Al, select either of these hands.
Just get to the funeral, e.b. Go to 20 if you have to.
Just get that fucking claim.
20 if I have to.
My word.
What a handsome man.
Wish I could tell you I recognize him.
Thank you anyway.
- Your dad, I expect.
- Yes.
You have reason to think he's out here?
He wrote us from Bismarck he'd be prospecting the hills.
- "Us" being?
- My brother.
He just got work over here.
Good for him.
So it's just the two of you?
Our mother passed, why we come from buffalo.
- And you're out here looking for your dad.
- Yes.
- Uh, Henry?
- Yes.
Out here looking for her father, Eddie.
Her and her older brother.
Got a photograph, I don't...
I don't recognize the likeness.
No.
- Henry Anderson?
- Yes.
- Yeah, I don't recognize him.
- Mm.
What are you gonna do while your brother works?
Work too, while we're looking to set aside, if we have to move on.
Ah, if dad doesn't turn up here.
Yeah, what do you do?
Cook, clean, sew, sweep.
Uh-huh.
- How quick do you learn?
- Guess I learn pretty quick.
Maestro.
We are strangers and sojourners.
Mr. Garret's burial place is a great distance from New York city.
But his heart...
Ingrid...
Marta.
- And on the great day...
- mama.
- His father will take him into it.
- Papa.
As he will all who confess his son savior from wherever we may be put to rest.
Our hymn is "a mighty fortress."
My sympathies, madam, but, my own requirements force me to ignore what's seemly.
I must decide where to place my capital.
Might raising my offer to say, $19,500, uh, prompt you to an immediate answer?
No, Mr. Farnum.
I'll see him some other time.
Come on.
I will require a decision within 24 hours- please, stop speaking to me, Mr. Farnum.
I hope you ain't gived up on that little runt of a girl, Al.
Oh, do you worry for her, Dan?
Wandering the muck of our thoroughfare, her tiny self all but swallowed up in horseshit?
Hey, kid!
Come here.
- Yes, sir?
- Stand with us here a second.
What are- what are we doing?
Waiting.
And out the door he'll go, and prompt as a swiss fucking timepiece three big-tittied whores will now emerge from behind that screen.
He lines 'em up at two-foot intervals, smock tops down, and all but sprints past 'em, giving their titties a lick.
And if he misses a titty, does not let himself retrace his steps.
- Don't tell me.
- Yeah, and then he goes on his way home, relieved for the day.
What's your name?
It's miles, huh?
- Miles, yeah.
- Yeah.
Strange, huh, miles?
But something you gotta know about specialists.
They pay a premium and they never cause fucking trouble.
I sometimes imagine in my declining years running a small joint in Manchester, england, catering to specialists exclusive.
And to let 'em know they're amongst their own, I'll operate from the corner, hanging upside down like a fucking bat, hmm?
- Oh, we're not such bad sorts here, huh, miles?
- No, sir.
So do you wanna ask your sister if she'd like to reconsider, hmm?
- You don't really mean that, Mr. Swearengen.
- Of course I don't mean it.
How dare you suggest I'd mean a thing like that, huh?
I did my part.
Raised our offer to 20 and demanded answer within the day.
But what, you cocksucker?
Bullock's come back.
I expect she'll wanna take counsel with him.
Tell the whore I wanna see her.
And I trust this doesn't alter our agreement.
I trust you know 2% of nothing's fucking nothing.
That fella from Montana
I knew to trust won't be able to assay your claim.
- I see.
- We'll engage someone local, and I'll keep an eye on him.
As I've decided to stay in camp, Mr. Bullock, at least for the near term,
I hope you'll feel absolved of those responsibilities towards my interest that you undertook at Mr. Hickok's request.
I prefer to see 'em through.
They're properly mine.
I even feel marginally capable of shouldering them and I certainly realize that you and Mr. Star have responsibilities of your own.
Are you firing me, Mrs. Garret?
I'm offering you absolution.
Otherwise I'm staying on.
I'm so sorry you were hurt.
So, how hard are they coming at you to sell?
I could confide that in an effort to blur my judgment,
Mr. Swearengen engaged intermediaries to indulge me with opium.
But that would entail acknowledging that
I've had a weakness in that direction.
Uh... more appropriately, uh, I could add at the graveyard Mr. Farnum raised his offer
$7,500, presumably also on Mr. Swearengen's instruction, and set a 24-hour limit to my reply.
Under the circumstances, I'd say that's coming pretty hard.
Please forgive me for making you uncomfortable, Mr. Bullock.
I had better manners before I began to abstain.
That's all right.
Anyways, are you at risk for the smallpox?
I was inoculated in New York city.
The child whose life you saved presumably has not been, but I assume she's safer under my care than traveling in a covered wagon with strangers.
Anyways, I'll line up the assayer.
Thank you.
You are changed.
You seem to be too.
Our stock's depleted, but we are offering a 100% discount on any item that catches your eye.
I've got money.
Our special get- acquainted-with-those- we'd-like-to-get- acquainted-with sale.
Mr. Utter.
I brought these pickaxes for you to sell.
There's two sifters on that black cayuse out there.
Mighty grateful, sir.
You got this place just about built, don't you?
Saving the last master-strokes for Seth.
Oh, hello.
I didn't see you.
Hello.
Hey, that's that little girl, isn't it?
Taking care of her for Mrs. Garret.
As much as she favors you, she could be yours.
I lost the receipts for my costs.
Maybe while you was busy saving my partner's life.
Let me get these sifters for you.
See if you can make those accounts add up.
I don't know if you heard me inside thanking you for helping my friend.
I heard you.
It's all right.
I'm sorry you lost yours.
All right.
Thank you.
Welcome back, Mr. Utter.
We've had a mild increase in rates, but I do have a room available.
I'll see.
What do you want, Mr. Farnum?
I have a message for Trixie that's looking to that orphan child.
- She's to see her longer-term employer.
- I'll tell her.
You know who that is?
I know she works at the gem.
And even so, admit her to your trade at public hours.
Congratulations, sir, on your advanced thinking.
Al wants you, Trixie.
Stickler for self-delivered messages.
Our dad ain't here.
I know it, even if my brother don't.
Maybe he never even tried to get here.
Or maybe he did try to get here and couldn't, maybe something happened to him.
There's so many ways it could be, flora, it's not much point deciding which it was.
He'd never think that, though, my brother.
Must be how he needs to do.
I ain't a virgin- if you wanna know that.
I had a boyfriend in buffalo.
Well, was you upset to have to leave him?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
I was upset.
At the same time he was a stupid son of a bitch.
And rough.
Here.
You can't tell my brother about him.
He'd make it back to buffalo and shoot lewis in the head.
All that way in defense of your virtue?
That's more trouble than I ever took with it.
Cy.
Lazarus risen.
Look at you, you son of a gun.
Hello, Cy.
Good to see you, Andy.
Don't be afraid to shake with me, Eddie.
I ain't contagious no more.
Highly becoming outfit.
I'm here for my belongings.
Look... they're gone, Andy.
Measures to stop the spread.
Ah hell, the important thing is you're well.
I'll front you whatever you need.
Let's get something going, hmm?
- Andy?
- In the flesh, sweetheart.
- Which ain't much to look at.
- You made it, Andy.
Oh, and we ain't getting nothing going.
All I come back for, Cy, was my things, and you tossed them too.
Why don't you take this and get yourself outta that clown outfit?
Once you've cooled off a little, think how you'd have done different when somebody showed up in the shape you was in and my responsibilities to meet.
Better than to throw him in the woods to fucking die?
Then don't think about nothing, Andy.
Use the money for a whore and a toot and go join the fucking circus.
Did you turn her out?
Her brother's gonna be a problem.
Fuck her brother.
We'll handle the brother if we have to kill the cocksucker.
That's an interesting piece of strange.
Ain't you a picture?
- What is it?
- Hmm?
Oh, am I detaining you in some way?
Am I fucking imposing?
Mrs. Garret's to sit down with bullock.
I thought you'd want me over there.
Oh yeah, so you can bring me a full and fair report, huh?
But will the widow have her wits about her, Trixie, huh?
Or will they be passing the opium pipe like heathens between 'em, her and fucking bullock, hmm?
- What're you pissed off for?
- I ain't pissed off.
I'm in fucking wonderment.
I'm waiting to be kept happy by the next fucking fairy tale.
Do you want me back at the hotel or do you wanna do something to me?
Now why would I want you to go back there, huh?
Or rely on anything you said transpired after you lied about her taking dope, huh?
Her being high... wasn't gonna have nothing to do with whether or not she sold you that claim, and she wanted to get off the dope.
And that little one needs someone to care for her... and maybe get her the fuck outta here.
And I knew it wasn't gonna be me.
So you want me back over there and to tell you what they fucking decide?
Or do you wanna rip my fucking guts out?
You get back there quick.
Don't kid yourself, Trixie.
Don't get a mistaken idea.
Mr. Utter.
This is where bill got killed, huh?
Uh...
I'll be sorry about that for as long as I live.
Can you tell me about it?
Yeah.
It- it was about sun-up over at that Bella union joint,
Mr. Hickok plum gutted McCall at draw.
And now here Mr. Hickok was at poker again.
Say a couple hours of daylight left and in come that coward McCall.
Walked up on him and shot him in the head.
Bill never know when he come in.
Uh, those of us that did, we didn't have no inkling of what he intended.
He just murdered him, right where he sat.
If I may, sir... this is here where wild bill was sitting when McCall entered from the front, approached the table, causing no apprehension 'cause he had often frequented the game.
Of a sudden, McCall produced a revolver and shouting "take that, damn you!" He fired.
Muzzle couldn't have been three inches from wild bill's head.
Now I'm told that Hickok fell dead immediately, but I won't testify to it, because the bullet, after it passed through wild bill's brain, struck me in my right wrist, and I lost several seconds to pain before regaining my senses.
Sir, you have my word as eyewitness to the rest, and I suppose this wound as added proof for the doctors they feared crippled me in the hand I use to write.
I will take the murderer's bullet to my grave.
Thanks.
Aces over eights, as I just now recall.
That is the hand that wild bill had.
Sure, captain.
Sure.
You like how that falls?
Sure.
- Do you like it, flora?
- Why not?
I'd prefer you happy, honey, but if you can't be, you need to pretend at it better than you're doing or you're gonna be hungry and cold and getting done to you for nothing outside
what you'd have made money to live on and save up besides if you acted the part in here.
I thought I only had to act it with them that wanna stick it in me.
You never know who that might be, flora.
There you go.
I prefer you happy.
Or at least pretending better?
I think he's dead, doc.
Could you tell the litter bearers not to make so much of getting this one outta here?
- Has young joey gone to dust?
- Yeah.
As flesh must, to be restored by the savior's return.
Oh, Mr. Bullock is back among us, and also, also Mr. Utter.
Does Charlie know about bill?
They were together, Mr. Bullock and he.
They'd captured Jack McCall.
I hope that's only the beginning of what they fucking did to him.
- Gave him over to the federal authorities.
- Gave him over?
- Rendered unto Caesar.
- Jesus Christ.
Mr.
- Mr. Bullock was struck by an Indian's axe.
Marked like the first-born of Adam and eve.
- Are you drunk?
- No.
- What the fuck is that?
- He's all right.
All right, reverend.
All right, reverend.
All right.
You're all right, reverend.
All right.
He marks us sinful and forgiven by confession.
All right.
He has told us and shown us.
He has told me.
All right.
You listen to me now, reverend.
You are goddamn exhausted, and you give yourself no respite.
These seizures may owe something to that, but it also wouldn't surprise me if you had a lesion in your goddamn head, and that's what's giving you the seizures and generating your chats with the goddamn divinity.
No goddamn offense intended.
- None taken, sir.
- Now get outta here,
- and get yourself some rest!
- Go on, reverend.
Doc's tired too, the only reason he's talking so fucking harsh.
Could not the lesion be the instrument of god's instructive intention, doctor, if I am so afflicted?
Well, of course it could, his ways not being ours and so forth.
But could he not, reverend, just want you getting out of here and getting yourself some goddamn rest?
- You have to go now.
- We don't have to do nothing,
I'd pay the same price just to sit with you.
My brother works in this place up here, and he keeps a hard watch.
If you wanna stick it in me tomorrow, you better let me go in by myself.
- What time are you gonna start?
- 11:00, I guess.
I'll be receiving around noon.
All right, flora.
Here's a dollar anyway.
You're swell.
Evening.
Evening, miss.
- You're early.
- Yes.
- I guess no luck finding your dad.
- No, no luck.
I knew you would've had a cheerier look on your face if you had.
Let me get you a place to sit away from these rough sons of bitches.
Hey!
Do your drinking at the bar or get the fuck out of here!
You have a seat here.
I'll get you a beverage.
Do you want a soft cider or a sarsaparilla?
- Cider if it's not a trouble.
- Soft cider.
Did she find her dad?
Her chances of finding her dad are greater than yours of walking out of this door upright, unless you shut your fucking mouth.
You got it?
Swearengen's had his hand on the tiller far as getting dealing with this epidemic.
- Is that so?
- Yeah, the dead don't drink or chase women must be his thinking on that subject.
That Indian fought like hell.
I'd guess you did too.
Charlie figured out how it must have been.
The Indian had to kill me for coming on the burial place, and maybe it had been me, too, that killed his friend, cut his friend's head off so he wouldn't have eyes to see the sunset
all those years he'd be lying there dead.
So he had to kill me for that too.
And he couldn't before he'd laid hands on me or the killing wouldn't be honorable.
We fought like fucking hell, I'll tell you that much, and I never once had the upper-hand.
It just happened out the way it happened out.
He was just trying to live, same as me, and do honor to his friend, and make some fucking sense out of things.
And we wind up that way, and I wind up after beating him till I couldn't recognize his face.
For Christ's sake!
That Indian saved Jack McCall's life,
- I'll tell you that fucking much.
- Not for long.
Brian Macdonald's not coming.
I want his recommendation who should assay that widow's claim.
- Whose?
- Swearengen's.
Shit, Seth.
Get his opinion, too, who should guard that henhouse we're gonna build.
So... are you okay?
- Yes, and you?
- Yes.
They're nice here.
And Mr. Swearengen, he's funny as all get-out.
So what place would make a better score?
Where I'm working.
But why not take 'em both?
- Could we have a private talk?
- Sure we can.
- Should I be armed?
- Where do you wanna talk?
Come here.
What do you think of that?
I think that son of a bitch better stop looking evil at that little girl.
- So was it McCall who improved your appearance?
- No.
Whoever got the job done, I hope you gave as good as you got.
It's good to have you back, with me being superstitious and all hell breaking loose when you left.
I'm here to talk about Mrs. Garret.
They planted her husband this morning?
I wrote a man about coming to assay her claim,
- but he can't make it.
- Plenty of local alternatives.
I want you to nominate someone.
Do you?
So if any way his work was mistaken,
I'd be coming after you.
- You would?
- Yeah.
Since I got nothing to do with the venture, what if I decline to make the recommendation?
Then you better hope whoever I find does his job right, 'cause I'm still holding you accountable.
I ain't involved.
E.b. Farnum offered on her claim.
Farnum's your water-boy and I know what you've been trying to do to her.
So here you come in all nobility... threatening me with a dire result if the property of that widow's husband thought worthless from when it sold, turns out not to be pinched out.
You and I know how it is, Mr. Swearengen.
- How what is?
- She gets a square shake, or I come for you.
What if I come for you?
Are you ready for that?
I guess I'd better be.
Then close your fucking store, 'cause being ready for me will take care of your waking hours and you better have someone to hand the task off to when you close your eyes.
We understand each other.
Al!
Al!
Jesus fucking Christ!
Walk right past me, your holiness, so I can shut my fucking office.
Al!
Go on!
Stare at her now!
Huh?
You like fucking little girls?
Take a look at that little girl 'cause she's the last thing you're ever gonna see.
- Stare at her now, cocksucker.
- Let him down!
Let him fucking down!
Or should I have had him hold him up?
You head what I said about the widow.
Oh yes, your holiness.
You heard me too.
So I take it this was a fair fucking fight, yeah?
Yeah!
That's right!
Two free drinks for everybody.
And drinks all night for them that help with the disposal.
That's me!
I'm sorry that you had to see that.
Shut the fuck up, Dan, and get her the fuck away from here - now!
Come on.
I'm sorry, Mr. Swearengen.
I warned him not to look at her.
I warned him.
Fucking pussy.
That joey passed this afternoon.
Been suffering awful.
But that frog-looking fellow left the tent that I found up in the woods, left the tent fucking cure pronounced by the doc himself.
And in the dumbest looking outfit a grown man ever wore.
Who's there, god damn it?
!
Who the hell's it look like?
How the fuck do I know who it fucking looks like?
It's dark!
Jesus Christ, come upon a person unawares in a fucking graveyard!
I heard you was back in the camp.
I heard you and that bullock got the cocksucker did for bill.
Was bill dead by the time you saw him?
Yeah, he was already dead.
Why did he let that son of a bitch get to him?
I don't know, Charlie.
Anyways, people don't scare me past speaking,
I come up here nights tell him the fucking news.
Go ahead.
Charlie avenged your fucking murder.
And that bullock fella was with me that you seemed to like.
Although it occurred to me to wonder why they didn't do for the cocksucker
- right on the fucking spot.
- Is that something we need to get into in front of him?
You got the biggest mouth in the territory.
You talk to him.
Tell him whatever you want.
I got that mail route in Cheyenne that we talked about.
I was bringing back supplies to them hardware boys and I run into that bullock fella.
He was out there looking for that McCall that- that killed you.
And he run into some heathen boy and he had one hell of a fight.
Boy, and he just- he got- he got f-
fuck.
Can I- can I tell him some more tomorrow?
Sure, what the fuck you asking me for?
I don't make the rules.
Wanna go back to the camp?
Please.
And what must Mr. Bullock have been thinking as I inflicted my personal confidences upon him?
- I don't know.
- Nor do I.
At least he kept a decent privacy.
I have to go back to the gem.
He's waiting for me now to tell him yours and Mr. Bullock's thinking about selling the claim, and I won't be able to lie anymore.
Next I tell will be my last.
So I better just get back there.
Mr. Swearengen discovered our deception?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Looking at you walk out of the fucking hotel.
- He did not.
I was careful to see he wasn't watching in the window.
It don't matter, Mrs. Garret.
The point is, I gotta go back.
And you need someone to look to this child, and with choices bigger elsewhere and nothing I can tell to hold you here, maybe you better think about selling and getting out.
Would you wanna take the girl and go?
Where?
- I have no people anywhere.
- You could goto New York.
L
- I could have my relatives there see you established.
What the fuck?
What would keep you here?
You wanna fuck this man?
Fuck him, then think about the child- don't use that language with me, Trixie, or that tone- don't you wanna say to remember my place?
I do, you rich cunt.
And I'm going back to it.
She's about to say her name, you know.
She named her sisters and her folks.
Think of selling.
If you took her away, you could hear her say it.
( theme music playing )
HER MAJESTY AWAKES, HUH?
- ( urinating )
- COCKSUCKER'S GONNA GRACE ME
WITH HIS FUCKING PRESENCE THIS MORNING.
FUCKING MAGISTRATE CLAGETT
WILL IMPART TO ME THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE SETTLEMENT
OF HIM AND HIS FELLOW LYING FUCKING THIEVES
AT THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE OF YANKTON.
HOW FUCKING MUCH IT'S GONNA COST US TO GET ANNEXED
WHEN THEY SIGN A TREATY WITH THE FUCKING DIRT WORSHIPERS, HUH?
HOW HARD IS THE LEGISLATURE GONNA SQUEEZE OUR BALLS
WITH REGARD TO OUR TITLE AND PROPERTIES, HUH?
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO THESE COCKSUCKERS, BUT YOU HAVE TO.
IN LIFE,
YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT OF THINGS YOU DON'T FUCKING WANT TO DO.
MANY TIMES, THAT'S WHAT THE FUCK LIFE IS--
ONE VILE FUCKING TASK AFTER ANOTHER.
BUT DON'T GET AGGRAVATED.
THEN THE ENEMY HAS YOU BY THE SHORT HAIR.
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT AFTER THE ANNEXATION.
THAT'S ALL.
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.
( sniffing ) EVERYTHING CHANGES.
DON'T BE AFRAID.
I CAN HOPE--
THOSE'LL BE APPEARING ON A REGULAR BASIS.
NO.
NO?
HOW'S YOUR ARM?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
DON'T FUCKING TRY DOING AWAY WITH YOURSELF AGAIN, HUH?
GOOD MORNING, GENTLEMEN.
THIS IS ELLSWORTH, WHO FOUND THE GOLD ON YOUR CLAIM.
- HOW DO YOU DO, MR.ELLSWORTH?
- PLEASURE.
- AND THIS IS SOPHIA.
- PLEASURE, SOPHIA.
I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR EXPERTISE AND KEEN EYESIGHT.
LUCK'S WHAT YOU WANT TO CONGRATULATE ME ON, MRS. GARRET.
TILL YOU DECIDE HOW YOU WANT DEVELOP IT,
ELLSWORTH CAN SPEND TIME ENOUGH AT WAGES
ON YOUR CLAIM TO SUSTAIN YOUR OWNERSHIP.
I NOD AS IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU JUST SAID.
HE'LL EXPLAIN IT ALL TO YOU.
MIGHT WE HAVE A WORD, MR. BULLOCK?
I'M CERTAIN MR. ELLSWORTH'S ARE VERY CAPABLE HANDS,
BUT I HOPE YOU'RE NOT DISASSOCIATING YOURSELF FROM MY AFFAIRS.
I ALREADY GOT MY IMPRESSION OF THIS FELLOW, MRS. GARRET.
THIS MEETING'S HOW YOU FORM YOURS.
I SEE.
THEN WE COMPARE NOTES AND DECIDE HOW YOU PROCEED.
FINE.
TOWARD A FUTURE POINT WHEN YOU TELL ME MY THINKIN'S SO CONSISTENTLY WRONGHEADED
IT'S A WASTE OF YOUR VALUABLE TIME HAVING TO DEAL WITH ME.
IN ANY CASE, I KNOW YOU HAVE MANY CLAIMS ON YOUR ATTENTION.
A COUPLE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'D LEAN MORE ON WHAT I FELT ABOUT THIS FELLOW THAN WHAT I SAW.
LATE AS USUAL.
I JUST COMES FROM THE CREEK, MR. FARNUM.
WASHIN' MY PANTS.
A HABIT TO CULTIVATE.
AND UNDER A ROCK DOWN THERE, I FOUND OTHER PANTS OF MINE I THOUGHT I'D LOST.
BUT SEEIN' AS I GETS DRUNK AND ON OCCASION SHITS MYSELF,
I FIGURED THAT MUST BE HOW I LOST 'EM IN THE FIRST PLACE.
I IMAGINE YOU MAKING YOUR WAY FROM THE CREEK,
ROLLING INTO THE LOBBY WHEN ALL OTHERS ARE ABED,
BARE-ASS NAKED WITH SHIT STREAMING DOWN THE BACKS OF YOUR LEGS.
SIR, NO.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE NIGHT THAT MR. HICKOK WAS KILLED.
NOW I RECALL THAT MR. HICKOK...
HE GIVES UNTO ME A LETTER FOR ME TO PUT IN POST,
BUT WHAT WITH ALL THE HULLABALO AND ME GETTIN' DRUNK,
I FORGOT ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.
UNTIL I FOUND MY PANTS.
DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA TOUCH THAT?
NO, UH, I DIDN'T GET MY PANTS WET,
NOR DID I SOIL THE LETTER WHEN I SOILED MYSELF.
THAT'S THE MIRACLE OF IT, SIR.
SO I'M TO BELIEVE THAT'S A LETTER WRITTEN BY WILD BILL HICKOK
JUST BEFORE HIS MURDER BY THE COWARD McCALL?
- JUST MINUTES BEFORE, SIR.
- ADDRESSED TO WHOM?
HIS WIFE, SIR.
WELL, I ONLY HOPE YOU HAVEN'T OPENED IT.
NO, SIR.
AT LEAST THAT ELIMINATES TAMPERING FROM THE LIST.
OF WHAT, SIR?
CRIMES IN WHICH YOUR INEBRIATION AND SLOTH
AS MY EMPLOYEE HAS IMPLICATED MY HOTEL,
WHICH I WILL ATTEMPT TO SHIELD YOU FROM
IN THE COURSE OF TRYING TO EXTRICATE MYSELF.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO EXTRICATE YOU, SIR.
I-
- I DIDN'T--
JUST GIVE ME THE CONFOUNDED LETTER!
- AND NONE OF THIS HANGDOG LOOK.
- SIR.
- NOT A WORD OF THIS TO ANYONE.
- YES, SIR.
MR. UTTER.
HEARTY CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW VENTURE.
TAKE A WHILE TO FIND OUT IF THOSE ARE WHAT'S IN ORDER.
BEING THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF MY ENTERPRISE,
I WORE THIS FROCK-COAT.
VERY FLATTERING.
YOU DON'T THINK IT LOOKS STUPID?
NOT TO ME, NO.
MR. DORITY ALL OF A SUDDEN STUMBLED,
AND IN-
- IN GRABBIN' AT SCRUB TO STEADY HIM,
I SAW A COLOR BENEATH.
( chuckles ) AIN'T YOU A LITTLE DOLL.
SHE'S FORMED AN INSTANT ATTACHMENT.
WELL, ANYWAYS, I'M GLAD TO KEEP YOUR TITLE GOOD WORKIN' THE SURFACE,
BUT THE QUARTZ OUTCROP WE FOUND--
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW HOW RICH YOUR STRIKE IS
UNTIL YOU SINK SOME SHAFTS.
NOW, I AIN'T EXPERT PROSPECTIN' THAT WAY.
I'M A MAN WHO WORKS IN CREEKS.
THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME SO.
NOT BEIN' IMPERTINENT,
YOUR PEOPLE GONNA HELP YOU WITH THIS?
MY BROTHER AND MY FATHER ARE AWARE OF MY SITUATION
AND MY HUSBAND'S PARENTS.
I HAVE NO IDEA AS TO THE PROSPECT OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT.
WELL, BLOOD DON'T ALWAYS PROVE LOYALTY.
BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME PEOPLE ON YOUR SIDE, MRS. GARRET,
'CAUSE I BELIEVE YOU GOT A BIG ONE ON YOUR HANDS.
I BELIEVE MR. BULLOCK'S ON MY SIDE.
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
AND I BELIEVE YOU ARE, TOO.
EXCUSE ME.
I WAS AMONG THEM FOUND THAT LITTLE GIRL.
I'M GLAD TO SEE HER DOING WELL.
I'M ALMA GARRET.
HOW DO YOU DO?
ELLSWORTH.
CHARLIE UTTER.
- ( knocking )
- COME IN.
- Johnny:
YES, SIR.
- YOU SEE THIS?
"UTTER FREIGHT AND POSTAL DELIVERY SERVICE."
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DROP A FUCKING STITCH.
WHAT STITCH DID I DROP?
I DID.
THIS FREIGHT AND DELIVERY SERVICE SHOULD'VE BEEN OPENED BY PERSIMMON PHIL
- AS A COVER FOR HIS OTHER FUCKING ACTIVITIES.
- HE'S DEAD.
I KNOW HE'S DEAD NOW.
WELL, IF YOU DON'T KNOW, NOBODY DOES.
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT IN A REPLACEMENT, IS MY FUCKING POINT.
WELL, YOU'LL KNOW BETTER NEXT TIME.
THE DIRECTION OF MY THOUGHTS--
WITH THE SUSTAINED FUCKING STUPIDITY THAT YOU'RE EXHIBITING,
I HESITATE TO VOICE THEM--
IS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRAIN FOR PHIL'S FORMER POSITION.
AL.
I HAVE HOPED FOR THIS CONVERSATION
EVER SINCE YOU GIVE ME THAT INDIAN HEAD TO HIDE.
HOW'D IT GO WITH JOHNNY?
I HAVE JUST FLED MY OWN OFFICE IN HORROR
AT HIS FUCKING DIMWITTEDNESS.
WELL, PERSIMMON PHIL WAS NO GENIUS.
I KNOW.
AND JOHNNY, SO EAGER.
I KNOW.
WAS IT NOT MY FUCKING IDEA TO ASK HIM?
THERE'S A MINIMAL STANDARD, HE'LL BE IN THE WILDERNESS.
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN A THOUGHT.
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO REMEMBER FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS.
- HIS HONOR.
- OH, YEAH.
HOLD FAST YOUR VALUABLES.
HEY, AL.
ANY REASON I CAN'T SHARE WITH DAN
THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE TALK ME AND YOU JUST HAD ABOUT ME
TAKING OVER FOR PERSIMMON PHIL?
YEAH, KEEP DAN IN THE DARK.
HAVE A SEAT, YOUR HONOR.
- HEY, JOHNNY.
- DAN.
WHAT'S NEW?
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THE CAMP STANDS WITH THE LEGISLATURE.
AND DON'T GIVE ME THIS, UM,
- "ON THE ONE HAND AND ON THE OTHER HAND."
- ALL RIGHT.
JUST SAY, "THIS IS THE WAY I THINK IT'S GONNA BE,"
'CAUSE THIS SEVERAL- HANDS FUCKING SHIT DON'T HELP ME.
- I'LL BOIL THINGS DOWN.
- GO AHEAD.
LET'S ASSUME FOR THE SAKE OF CONVERSATION
THAT THERE'S A NEW TREATY WITH THE SIOUX PEOPLES.
"PEOPLE," THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CALLING THOSE COCKSUCKERS NOW?
THAT'S THE WAY THINGS ARE HEADED?
ASSUMING THE NEW TREATY, THE HILLS WILL BE ANNEXED.
THE TERRITORY RESPECTS THE STATUTES OF THE NORTHWEST ORDINANCE,
WHICH STATE THAT A CITIZEN CAN HAVE TITLE TO ANY LAND
UNCLAIMED OR UNINCORPORATED BY SIMPLE USAGE.
ESSENTIALLY, IF YOU'RE ON IT
AND YOU IMPROVE IT, YOU OWN IT.
BUT, WHAT COMPLICATES THE SITUATION
IS THAT THE HILLS WERE DEEDED TO THE SIOUX
BY THE 1868 FORT LARAMIE TREATY.
THIS COULD MEAN THAT THE LAND OCCUPIED BY THE CAMP
DOESN'T FALL UNDER ANY STATUTORY DEFINITION
OF UNCLAIMED OR UNINCORPORATED.
SO WHO NEEDS TO GET PAID?
SIGNS OF CONCILIATION AND WILLINGNESS WOULD WEIGH IN THE CAMP'S FAVOR.
BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT IS THE PRESENCE
OF A AD HOC MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION
THAT WOULD ENABLE THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY
DEADWOOD EXISTS, WE DON'T HAVE TO CREATE IT.
IT WOULD BE DISRUPTIVE IF WE DID.
THE COMMUNITY'S ALREADY ORGANIZED,
NOT LEGALLY MAYBE, BUT CERTAINLY INFORMALLY.
WHY NOT LET'S GIVE THIS INFORMAL ORGANIZATION
THE BLESSING OF LEGAL STANDING?
WHAT'S THE RIGHT FUCKING NUMBER FOR THE LEGISLATURE?
THERE'S A LOT OF GOLD OUT HERE, AL.
TO DEFINE "RIGHT" IN THIS ENVIRONMENT
IS VERY LIABLE TO BE AN ONGOING PROCESS.
WHAT I'M PREPARED TO DO IS MAKE A LIST OF NAMES
AND A PRELIMINARY GUESS AT SOME NUMBERS.
I SHOULD TELL YOU AS WELL THAT A WARRANT'S REACHED YANKTON
CHARGING YOU WITH MURDER IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.
AS THE SETTLEMENT'S STATUS CHANGES, YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT.
I COULD HELP WITH THAT TOO.
HOW MUCH IS THAT GONNA COST ME?
$5,000.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'LL CONTINUE WRITING.
GOOD MORNING, MISS JANE.
YEAH, HELLO.
NO ONE CROAKED TODAY.
TOMMY'S STILL FUCKING SICK AND THE DOC WILL BE BACK
I GUESS WHENEVER HE FUCKING FEELS LIKE IT.
SEE YOUR FUCKING EYES ARE STILL PLAYIN' TUG O' WAR.
WELL, THIS IS THE ONE TO LOOK AT.
LEFT ARM STILL USEFUL AS AN OLD MAN'S DICK?
DO I SMELL STRANGELY TO YOU, MISS JANE?
WHAT?
DO I HAVE A STRANGE ODOR ABOUT ME?
WHAT IS THAT, YOUR CLEVER WAY OF SAYING YOU SMELL WHISKEY ON MY BREATH?
NO.
IF EITHER OF YOUR FUCKING EYES TAKES ME FOR HIDING
I'M DRINKING AGAIN OCCASIONALLY, IT'S SADLY MISTAKEN,
SO DESIST FROM ANY CLEVER ODOR REFERENCES.
I THOUGHT THE SMELL MIGHT BE COMING OFF THE CREEK
SO I WENT INTO THE HILLS LAST NIGHT BUT IT FOLLOWED ME THERE TOO,
AS IF MY, UH, AS IF MY FLESH WERE ROTTING.
I, UH-
- DO I LOOK LIKE A MAN TAKEN FROM HIS OWN GRAVE?
GOD DAMN YOU, PREACHER, DON'T START TALKING CRAZY TO GO WITH EVERYTHING ELSE.
ALSO, WHEN I READ THE-- THE SCRIPTURES,
I DO NOT FEEL CHRIST'S LOVE AS I USED TO.
OH, IS THAT SO?
THAT IS TOO BAD.
JOIN THE FUCKING CLUB OF MOST OF US.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, PREACHER.
I SEE YOU SKULKING AROUND WHEN THE DOC COMES IN.
YOU'RE TRYING TO HIDE YOUR FUCKING EYES,
TRYING TO HIDE YOUR FUCKING ARM.
YOU'RE A FUCKING MESS.
AND I AM IN THE PROCESS OF WEARING OUT MY OWN FUCKING WELCOME IN THIS CAMP.
AND I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO BE AROUND HERE MUCH LONGER
FOR PEOPLE TO BE DISGUSTED BY
SO THEY DON'T NOTICE WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH YOU!
AND YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS
AND RAISE YOUR NERVE TO CONSULT WITH THE DOC!
GOD DAMN YOU!
SPILLING MY CLEANING WATER TOO, MINISTER!
UP.
THANK YOU, I'M FINE.
YOU'RE FINE.
I AM OFF DUTY.
YOU'RE ON DUTY.
YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF!
AL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT?
CLEARING MY HEAD.
AND IF I BLINK WHEN I SPEAK,
THAT'S BECAUSE I JUST GOT FUCKING FLEECED.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- BE AT MY JOINT IN TWO HOURS.
- WE'RE FORMING A FUCKING GOVERNMENT.
- YES, SIR.
- ( glass shatters )
- MERRICK!
JESUS CHRIST.
HEY, MERRICK!
COCKSUCKER.
SHOOT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.
I BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO SEND FOR MY WIFE AND BOY.
TREATY COMING WITH THE SIOUX.
WHERE THE FUCK IS MERRICK, HUH?
!
WE DON'T KNOW.
WELL ANYWAYS, THIS IS IT.
WHAT WE SPOKE ABOUT BEFORE, THIS PUTS IT TO THE TEST.
ALL RIGHT.
INFORMAL MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION.
NOT GOVERNMENT.
NO, THAT WOULD MARK US REBELLIOUS.
BUT STRUCTURE ENOUGH TO PERSUADE THOSE TERRITORIAL COCKSUCKERS IN YANKTON
THAT WE'RE WORTHY ENOUGH TO PAY THEM THEIR FUCKING BRIBES.
WE'RE TO MEET TO DISCUSS PUTTING THIS ORGANIZATION TOGETHER.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
CENTURIES OF FUCKING INBREEDING
ATTUNE HIM TO THE NECESSITIES OF THE TIMES.
- ( chuckling )
- TWO HOURS, MY PLACE!
DID A FUCKING GOOD JOB HERE.
YOUR ROOM'S PUT BACK TOGETHER.
THAT AIN'T MY ROOM ANYMORE.
CY NEEDN'T HAVE DONE FOR THEM KIDS THAT WAY.
NOT IN YOUR ROOM,
NOT IN THE WAY HE DID FOR THEM.
I'M GETTING OUTTA HERE, EDDIE.
ARE YA?
I'M GOING TO OPEN MY OWN PLACE.
GOOD FOR YOU, HONEY.
HAVE YOU SAVED MONEY?
I GOT A WAY TO WORK IT.
I KNOW YOU'LL GET A LONG WAY AWAY FROM HERE FIRST.
YOU THINK I HAVE TO?
CY TOLD ME HE'D HELP ME OPEN A PLACE HERE.
HE PROMISED HE'D KEEP HIS DISTANCE.
GOOD.
- IS HE AROUND?
- ASLEEP.
THERE'S A MEETING IN MY PLACE
IN A COUPLE OF HOURS HE'LL WANT TO BE AWAKE FOR.
ALL THE PILLARS OF THE FUCKING CAMP.
YOU MIND?
YOU COULD USE SOME REST.
I COULD USE A CLEAN CONSCIENCE.
SO COULD WE ALL.
BLAH!
( spitting )
WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?
!
- AS YOU SEE.
- AS I SEE, WHAT?
AT MY STORAGE CABINET, REPLENTISHING NEEDED SUPPLIES.
BE OVER IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.
WE GOTTA FORM A GOVERNMENT FOR THE SETTLEMENT.
WHO DOES?
US!
YOU AND ME.
COME TO ME IN A VISION!
YOU STUPID BASTARD.
ANYWAYS, I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR A PLACE.
EDDIE.
SWEARENGEN'S CALLED A MEETING.
TWO HOURS.
WHERE'S JOANIE?
OUT LOOKING FOR A PLACE.
GOOD.
'CAUSE I TOLD JOANIE I'D BACK HER IN HAVING HER OWN JOINT.
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND, EDDIE?
YOU FUCKED ME UP, CY.
THE SHIT YOU DID TO THOSE KIDS,
THERE'S NO ANGLE TO IT.
THAT SHIT WASN'T JUST ABOUT THOSE KIDS, EDDIE.
YOU NEED TO SIT THERE AND TOUGH YOUR WAY THROUGH YOUR PROBLEM.
JUST KEEP SHUFFLING YOUR CARDS
AND LET YOUR TIE HANG DOWN TILL YOU FEEL BETTER.
I WANT TO COME TO THAT MEETING.
DO YA?
COME AHEAD, EDDIE.
PUT THE CARDS DOWN, TIGHTEN YOUR CRAVAT
AND COME ON IF IT'LL CHEER YOU THE FUCK UP.
( chuckles )
( chatter )
( squealing )
( chatter intensifies )
MORNIN'.
GOOD MORNING.
I'M OPENING THIS BUSINESS.
WELL, GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
I'M CHARLIE UTTER.
I'M JOANIE STUBBS.
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW DO YOU DO, CHARLIE?
OOH, I WAS OUT OF BREATH, BUT NOW I'M BETTER.
ARE YOU OFF SOMEPLACE?
UH, YOU NEED AN ESCORT OR THE LIKE?
NO, I'M MORE OR LESS JUST WALKING AROUND.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS FROCK-COAT?
VERY WELL FITTED.
I HAD IT MADE UP IN CHEYENNE.
I'M ONE FOR A GOOD APPEARANCE AND ALL,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE OUT OF MY PATH.
IF YOU WOULD HAVE MADE ME GUESS,
I WOULD HAVE SAID IT'S NOT YOUR USUAL GARB.
AND I'M A CONSIDERABLE HAND AT THE FREIGHT BUSINESS,
BUT FAR AS LEASING THIS BUILDING
BEFORE KNOWING WHAT THE TRAFFIC'S GONNA BEAR,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT POSSESSED ME.
SEE, I-- I DO WELL IN A CAMP
OR A SETTLEMENT OR A TOWNSHIP,
BUT THAT DON'T MAKE ME A CAMP
OR A SETTLEMENT OR A TOWNSHIP TYPE.
THIS IS THE ATTIRE FOR THAT TYPE OF TYPE.
ANYWAY, YOU'RE WEARING IT TODAY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY FOR RUNNING ON ABOUT IT.
I'M LOOKING FOR A PIECE OF PROPERTY
TO START A BUSINESS ON.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING OUT.
I SEE.
AND WHAT SORT OF BUSINESS YOU LOOKING TO OPERATE?
- BROTHEL.
- UH-HUH.
WELL, UH, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THIS CAMP HERE,
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOT SOME LEGS UNDER IT.
I'M JUST A WHORE, THOUGH.
I MEAN, I RUN THE WHORES FOR THIS MAN,
BUT FAR AS BEING READY TO RUN A PLACE
AND STAND UP TO ALL YOU HAVE TO STAND UP TO,
I-
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOT INTO ME.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
SOMETHING'S READY FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING,
DON'T SEEM TO MATTER IF YOU'RE READY OR NOT.
BETTER LIFT YOUR SKIRTS AND...
JUMP, HUH?
THAT'S WHAT'S COMING TO ME TO BE TRUE.
I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE NOT AT THAT BIG TOWN MEETING.
UH, YEAH, WELL, I'M, UH--
I'M HEADING OVER THERE SHORTLY.
UH, I PREFER TO APPEAR LATE TO THAT TYPE OF THING.
BELLA UNION, WHERE I WORK, IS BIGGER
BUT I GUESS BEING THAT IT'S MR. SWEARENGEN'S MEETING,
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HAVING IT AT THE GEM.
YEAH, THAT'S-
- THAT'S WHY IT'S LOCATED THERE.
YEAH.
IT'S AWFUL NICE TO MEET YOU, CHARLIE.
WELL IT'S GOOD TO MEET YOU, TOO, JOANIE.
TAKE CARE.
I'M GOING TO THE GEM.
I'M HEADING ON.
I'M HEADING FOR THE GEM.
HOORAY FOR YOU.
REVEREND IS LAID DOWN TRYING TO HIDE ANOTHER SEIZURE.
AIN'T YOU CLEVER TO SEE THROUGH THE SUBTERFUGE.
I BEEN LETTING IT GO,
BUT IF THE IDEA IS FOR YOU TO DRINK MORE AND MORE TILL I SAY SOMETHING,
I AM HEREBY OFFICIALLY SAYING
I WISH YOU WOULD STOP FUCKING DRINKING.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA
AS FAR AS YOU SAYING ONE FUCKING THING
ABOUT ANYTHING I DO OR DON'T,
FAR AS DRINKING
OR WHERE I STAND OR NAP
- OR ANY OTHER FUCKING THING CONCERNING ME.
- I SEE.
OR GO OR LEAVE OR DON'T OR WHEN.
ALL RIGHT, JANE.
SO YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF.
AND DON'T TRY AND HASTEN ANYONE ANYWHERE,
'CAUSE EVERYONE FOLLOWS THEIR OWN FUCKING PACE,
AND DON'T TRY AND FUCKING HASTEN THEM.
AND YOU HAPPEN TO BE FUCKING OVERLOOKING
THAT YOU THINK IT'S JUST ONE DAY AFTER ANOTHER
WITH THE SAME FUCKING SEIZURE
AS IF IT HAPPENED THE WEEK BEFORE.
AND THAT JUST SHOWS HOW MUCH YOU FUCKING KNOW
AND WHAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO.
( grunts) GOD DAMN YOU!
WHAT DO THEY PAY YOU TO HOLD THAT BUILDING UP?
CHARLIE UTTER
OF "UTTER CHARLIE AND FREIGHT."
IT'S ENOUGH TO GET YOU OFF WITH A POSITION.
I'M IN A POSITION,
YOU ETERNALLY MEDDLING COCKSUCKER.
YEAH, LEANING FORWARD, SHIT-FACED DRUNK.
I AM TALKING ABOUT NURSING THE PLAGUE.
FUCKING TENT OPERATION.
CARING OF THE SICK IN THE FUCKING TENT!
HOW ABOUT BULLWHACKER OF THE FUCKING FREIGHT
BETWEEN DEADWOOD AND CHEYENNE?
NO.
HOW ABOUT SUPERVISOR, MAIL DELIVERY?
GO AWAY, CHARLIE.
OR ANY FUCKING THING ELSE YOU WANT TO DO.
GO AWAY!
CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING A BIG FUCKING DEAL.
NO ONE'S ANY BIG FUCKING DEAL, JANE.
AND ALL THEM OFFERS STAND.
I'VE SEEN YOU IN SOME STUPID FUCKING OUTFITS IN MY TIME,
BUT THAT ONE TAKES THE PRIZE.
I THINK THAT THIS MONTH
WE'RE GONNA TRY RASPBERRY LEAF.
THANKS, DOC.
YOUNG LADY,
ANYTHING TO REPORT WITH YOUR PRIVATES?
NAH.
ALL RIGHT.
MEETING OUTSIDE WHEN YOU'RE DONE, DOC.
ALL RIGHT.
( clearing throat )
( door closes )
THANKS, DOC.
IN A CASE LIKE YOURS I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO PRESCRIBE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHOSE IDEA WAS THEM PEARS AND FUCKING PEACHES?
I FIGURED SINCE WE HAD 'EM FOR THE PLAGUE MEETING...
SHOWS GOOD THINKING AND INITIATIVE.
LADLE 'EM OUT AT VARIOUS INTERVALS ON THE FUCKING TABLE, JOHNNY.
YES, SIR.
I'M DECLARING MYSELF CONDUCTOR OF THIS MEETING
AS I HAVE THE BRIBE SHEET.
IF I'M EXCLUDED, SAY SO, AL.
DON'T LEAVE ME TO DIE THE DEATH OF THOUSAND CUTS.
- SIT DOWN, TOM.
- DON'T SUBJECT ME TO DEATH BY WATER TORTURE.
TAKE A SEAT, TOM, AND TOSS WHATEVER BOOK
YOU'VE BEEN READING ON THE FUCKING YELLOW PERIL, HUH?
I JUST OPENED ACROSS THE WAY.
WAS I SUPPOSED TO ATTEND?
WELL BEFORE I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION,
I BETTER KNOW WHO THE FUCK YOU ARE.
CHARLIE UTTER.
OF "UTTER'S FREIGHT AND POSTAL DELIVERY SERVICE."
NICE SIGN BLOCKING MY FUCKING VIEW.
TAKE A SEAT.
HAD A LOVELY ADVERT IN TODAY'S "PIONEER."
SO, US GOVERNMENT'S NEGOTIATING PEACE
WITH SPOTTED ELK, RED CLOUD
AND OTHER LEADERS OF THE HEATHENS.
THANK YOU, JOHNNY.
THE HEATHENS WILL GET MONEY TO GIVE UP THE HILLS,
AND THE HILLS'LL BE ANNEXED TO THE TERRITORY.
FIRST NOTICE OF OUR COST
TO AVOID GETTING FUCKED IN THE ASS
BY THOSE LEGISLATIVE COCKSUCKERS
WAS JUST HANDED TO ME BY YANKTON'S TOLL COLLECTOR,
WHO SUGGESTS ALSO OUR BEST CASE IN KEEPING TITLE TO THE CLAIMS,
PROPERTY AND BUSINESSES IS TO START UP NOW
A KIND OF AN INFORMAL GOVERNING ORGANIZATION
THAT'LL BE RECOGNIZED BY THE TERRITORIAL COCKSUCKERS
AND GIVEN LEGAL STATUS WHEN THE TERRITORY IS ANNEXED.
SINCE WE'LL ALL HAVE PROVED OURSELVES
CIVILIZED SORTS
THAT DON'T ONLY WEAR OUR PANTS TO COVER OUR TAILS,
HENCE THE FUCKING MEETING.
DO THE BRIBES COME OUT OF OUR POCKETS?
HMM?
THE HELL YOU MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH TALKING TO THAT LEECH.
HEREAFTER, YOU LET ME TAKE MY FAIR SHARE
- OF THE WEIGHT IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS.
- YEAH, THANKS, CY.
WELL, COULDN'T OUR INFORMAL ORGANIZATION LEVY TAXES
ON THE SETTLEMENT TO PAY THE BRIBES?
SAY TO LICENSE BUSINESSES?
WOULDN'T THAT SPREAD THE BURDEN?
WILL WOMEN WHO PAY THE LICENSE FEES
HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO OPERATE BROTHELS AS MEN?
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH THE PRICE OF FISH?
OUR PROPER ORDER OF FUCKING BUSINESS
IS TO MAKE TITLES AND DEPARTMENTS
BEFORE THE TERRITORIAL COCKSUCKERS
SEND IN THEIR COUSINS TO ROB AND STEAL FROM US.
WELL WHO FILLS THE VARIOUS POSITIONS?
PICK THE NAMES FROM A FUCKING HAT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
I'D LIKE TO BE MAYOR.
Al:
OBJECTIONS?
MAYOR.
WOULDN'T A GOOD USE FOR AN INFORMAL ORGANIZATION
WITH TEMPORARY APPOINTEES
BE PROVIDING A FEW SERVICES TO THE CAMP?
MAYOR?
WELL, PROVIDE A FEW SERVICES
AND USE THE LION'S SHARE OF REVENUES TO PAY THE BRIBES.
MORE THAN PROVIDING SERVICES TO 'EM,
TAKING PEOPLE'S MONEY IS WHAT MAKES ORGANIZATIONS REAL,
BE THEY FORMAL, INFORMAL OR TEMPORARY.
THERE'S A PIANO OUTSIDE.
PIANO?
WHEN TOLLIVER OPENED UP ACROSS THE WAY,
YOU SAID WE NEEDED A FANCIER PIANO.
YOU ORDERED ONE.
YOU WANT ME TO ABANDON THE FUCKING MEETING TO BRING IN A NEW PIANO?
WELL, I'M JUST TELLING YOU IT COME IN FROM MONTGOMERY WARD.
YEAH.
"ANY BIG ARRIVAL, NOTIFY ME IMMEDIATELY." YOU SAID THAT.
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- WELL, UM--
FLOOR'S OPEN FOR LEVY SUGGESTIONS
AND NOMINATIONS FOR DEPARTMENT HEADS.
SELF-NOMINATIONS ARE PERMITTED.
SORRY.
WE LACK A GAVEL.
DOC?
WHO'S GONNA BE COMPTROLLER?
A.W.:
WELL, UM, ELECTIONS?
WILL WE HAVE SOME ELECTIONS
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD?
THIS IS TEMPORARY, RIGHT?
- YEAH, AD HOC.
- AD HOC.
AD FUCKING HOC.
FREE FUCKING GRATIS.
CAN WE JUST GET ON WITH THE FUCKING MEETING?
( crowd chatter )
( piano playing )
TIMID, HA.
HARDLY, SIR.
MY OWN STRONG PERSONAL IMPULSE WAS TO OFFER MY NAME FOR OFFICE,
BUT A FOURTH ESTATE,
INDEPENDENT IN NAME AND FACT
FROM THE OPERATIONS OF GOVERNMENT
IS OF THE ESSENCE OF A FREE SOCIETY.
I'VE GOT TO FIND EARLY OCCASION
TO PUT THE MAYOR OFF HIS PEDESTAL.
DON'T DO IT WITH NO MUD.
DID YOU WAIT A DAY BEFORE YOU ORDERED THAT FUCKING THING?
BOSS, YOU SPECIFICALLY COUNTERMANDED MY WAITING
AND ASKING AGAIN WHEN YOU GAVE ME THE ORDER TO GET IT.
WHAT FUCKING REVENUE IS BEING GENERATED BY THOSE HOOPLE-HEADS
GATHERING AROUND THAT COCKSUCKER
AND YODELING ABOUT THEIR FUCKING POINTS OF ORIGIN?
THE SHINE'LL WEAR OFF.
MY FUCKING HEAD.
ALL THAT ORGANIZING BUSINESSES?
AW, 25 CUPS OF COFFEE AND TOO MUCH CIRCULATING IN THE FRESH AIR.
YOU CHAIRED PISS OUT OF THAT MEETING THIS AFTERNOON.
THAT STILL DON'T GET YOU OFF THE HOOK ABOUT THAT PIANO.
BEFORE I'D TOLD A STORY ON MYSELF LIKE THE DOC DID,
I'D HAVE JUST SAID, "THANK YOU FOR THE NOMINATION,
BUT I DECLINE BEING HEALTH SUPERVISOR."
THEY BUY BODIES TO DO THEIR RESEARCH.
DOCTORS, THEY CUT 'EM OPEN AND STUDY 'EM.
ALL THE LESS REASON FOR SAYING YOU'VE BEEN ARRESTED FOR GRAVE ROBBING.
SEVEN TIMES.
( chuckles ) ANYWAYS,
GOOD FOR YOU VOLUNTEERING FOR THE POST.
IF I HAD KNOWN THEN THEY WASN'T GONNA HAVE A SHERIFF,
- I'D HAVE NEVER RAISED MY HAND.
- I DON'T FOLLOW.
I ONLY RAISED MY HAND 'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SHERIFF.
IT'S ALL TEMPORARY, ANYHOW.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND AD HOC.
DID YOU HAPPEN TO NOTICE AT THE GEM
THAT ONE GIRL WE RODE BACK WITH FROM MR. GARRET'S FUNERAL?
TRIXIE, ISN'T THAT WHAT SHE SAID HER NAME WAS?
- WHO'D BEEN HELPING MRS. GARRET WITH THE CHILD.
- YEAH, I NOTICED HER.
MUCH AS SHE'D TAKEN TO HELPING WITH THAT LITTLE ONE.
BIG PULL TO THAT, GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU KNOW.
YOU THINK SHE'S PRETTY?
VERY.
- TAKE SOME AIR.
- YES, SIR.
- EVENIN'.
- EVENING.
SOME MEETING, HUH?
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW POST.
OH.
AND FOR YOUR FREIGHT BUSINESS.
- THANK YOU.
- OKAY.
EVENING, CHARLIE.
EVENING.
( sighing ) HOW MUCH TIME YOU THINK THAT
FIRE MARSHAL OBLIGATION'S GONNA TAKE?
MORE OR LESS AS MUCH AS YOUR HEALTH COMMISSIONER, HUH?
HOW ABOUT THAT DOC?
GRAVE ROBBER.
ANYBODY ELSE FELLED FROM THEM CANNED PEACHES?
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
WHY, YOU FEELING POORLY?
WELL, UM, IT'S-- IT'S EASING UP SOME.
- EVENING.
- EVENING.
I'VE WONDERED HOW THINGS WERE WITH YOU...
AND MRS. GARRET AND THE CHILD.
I EXPECT THEY'RE WELL.
I KNOW SHE STRUCK LUCKY AT HER CLAIM.
AND HOW ARE YOU, TRIXIE?
AS YOU SEE.
EARNING THE GREASY EYE FROM MY BOSS FOR IDLE CHATTER.
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?
I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T.
THIS ISN'T THE PLACE FOR YOU.
SO YOU SAY.
IF YOU INSIST ON MY EMBARRASSING MYSELF,
HAVE IT NOT WHERE I'D WANT YOU TO SEE ME.
COME SEE ME THEN.
HE DON'T PERMIT OUR MAKING CALLS OUT.
COME TO OUR STORE.
COME BUY A BROOM.
I DON'T WANT WHAT I CAN'T HAVE, MR. STAR.
ALL RIGHT.
IF I DID COME,
I'D BUY AN AXE, A HAMMER AND A SAW.
ALL FULLY STOCKED.
AND WE NEVER ASK THE PURPOSE OF A CUSTOMER'S PURCHASE.
OUR MAYOR.
OH, MAYOR!
DOCTOR.
I'M GONNA HAVE A LOOK AT YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
DON'T TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY, REVEREND.
BEING SICK AIN'T NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.
LOOK AT MY FINGER.
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE SMELL.
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU SMELL?
AS IF I'VE DIED.
YOU EMIT NO SUCH ODOR.
I SMELL MY FLESH ROTTING.
IT ISN'T ROTTING, REVEREND.
YOUR FLESH DOES NOT SMELL.
YOU'VE NOT DIED.
YOU'RE HAVING ORGANIC CHANGES IN YOUR MIND
THAT'S MAKING YOU BELIEVE THESE THINGS.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
FORMERLY, DOCTOR,
WHEN THE WORD TOOK ME AS I READ SCRIPTURE,
PEOPLE FELT GOD'S PRESENCE THROUGH ME
AND THAT WAS A GREAT GIFT THAT I COULD GIVE TO THEM.
NOW THE WORD DOES NOT TAKE ME WHEN I READ.
NOR DO I FEEL CHRIST'S LOVE.
NOR DO THOSE WHO LISTEN HEAR IT THROUGH ME.
ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS GOD'S PURPOSE.
THE NOT KNOWING THE PURPOSE IS...
MY PORTION OF SUFFERING.
AND IS THERE ANY PAIN
COMPETING WITH THE NOT KNOWING?
I'M NOT IN PAIN.
THERE ARE NEW SMELLS I SMELL.
AND THERE PARTS OF MY BODY I CAN'T FEEL,
AND HIS--
AND HIS LOVE.
AND YOU WANT TO CONTINUE LIKE THIS?
AS LONG AS HE WILLS, THIS MUST BE MY PART.
TO BE AFRAID, AS WELL.
WELL IF THIS IS HIS WILL, REVEREND,
HE IS A SON OF A BITCH.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, DOCTOR.
HEY, EDDIE.
HEY, KID.
HOW'D IT GO?
ALL RIGHT.
AND I GOT ME A FOUR-BIT ROOM.
PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHERE.
Joanie:
HI, CY.
I WAS AFRAID I'D LOST YOU TO THE HEATHENS.
HOW WAS THAT MEETING?
ALL RIGHT.
WE WERE ORGANIZING FOR ANNEXATION
UNTIL EDDIE CRACKED HIS FUCKING MOUTH.
WHAT'D IT TURN TO THEN?
( laughing )
A JOINT LIKE OURS, JOANIE, WHAT ARE WE SELLING?
WALK THROUGH THIS DOOR,
IT'S A NEW START.
COME ON IN, TRY YOUR LUCK HERE.
OF COURSE, WE KNOW
THE PERCENTAGES BEING THE PERCENTAGES, YOU PLAY LONG ENOUGH,
YOUR LUCK AIN'T GONNA GET NO BETTER HERE THAN ANYWHERES ELSE.
MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE WE'RE IN A BRAND NEW CAMP.
SINCE WE ARRIVED,
CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO ME
SEEM TO HAVE BOUGHT INTO OUR OWN FUCKING LINE
AND NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO GET ME TO GO ALONG.
BUT I CAN'T.
SEE, JOANIE, 'CAUSE I'M A BIG BOY.
NOW I'M READY FOR...
EDDIE AND ME TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.
I DID LOOK AROUND FOR PLACES, CY.
GOOD, I WANTED YOU TO.
I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND DO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.
GOOD, HONEY.
WITH YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN.
EDDIE SAWYER.
CAN WE KEEP THIS SHORT?
SURE, EDDIE.
IF HE FINDS YOU A 12-YEAR-OLD FARMBOY TO HAVE SOME FUN WITH,
IS THAT SHORT ENOUGH FOR YOU?
I NEVER DID THAT AND YOU KNOW IT.
ALL THIS CRAP ABOUT WHAT IS AND ISN'T NATURAL,
WHATEVER DOES IT FOR A FELLA IS WHAT DOES IT, AIN'T THAT RIGHT?
I NEVER DID THAT.
BUT DID YOU EVER WANT TO UNBUTTON SOME FARMBOY'S DENTONS
AND GET YOURSELF SOME RELAXATION?
THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING.
TAKE THAT BOY YOU SPOKE UP FOR UP IN JOANIE'S ROOM THE OTHER DAY.
I SPOKE UP FOR NOT TORTURING THAT BOY.
WELL, WHAT YOU SPOKE FOR AND WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED TO DO
IF IT WAS JUST YOU AND THAT CORN-FED IN THAT ROOM ALONE
IS WHAT I'M INQUIRING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.
- A DRY HOLE, CY.
- AW, YOU COULD WORK THAT OUT.
YOU JUST USE SOME SPIT ON THAT OR LARD.
17 FUCKING YEARS AND I NEVER SAW A LOOK ON YOUR FACE
LIKE I SAW UP THERE IN THAT ROOM THE OTHER DAY.
INCLUDING WHEN I HAD TO SMACK SOME GIRL AROUND.
I WAS NEVER IN A ROOM WITH YOU BEFORE
WHERE YOU WAS GONNA KILL SOMEBODY.
I DO NOT MAKE JUDGMENTS.
I GAVE THAT UP A LONG TIME AGO.
ALL I WANT IS FOR US TO GET ALONG BETTER, EDDIE.
SO EVERY TIME YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH IN PUBLIC,
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE FUCK'S GONNA COME OUT!
SO LET ME GET YOU SOME FUCKING KID
TO FUCK IN THE ASS OR MOUTH OR SUCK HIS PRICK OR LET HIM FUCK YOU!
FUCK YOU, CY.
FUCK YOU.
NOW, NOW.
THAT'S WHERE I DRAW THE LINE.
FRIEND OR NO FRIEND, AND US WANTING TO GET ALONG BETTER OR NOT,
I WANT YOU TO GO UP INTO JOANIE'S ROOM, WHICH I--
I GATHER SHE DON'T WANT TO GO INTO NO MORE.
I WANT YOU TO GO UP THERE AND THINK THIS THING THROUGH.
IMAGINE YOURSELF UP THERE WITH THAT BOY
LIKE THE OTHER DAY, ONLY THIS TIME IT'S JUST HIM AND YOU.
AND I WANT YOU TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT.
'CAUSE NEXT TIME WE SEE EACH OTHER,
I WANT YOU CLEARHEADED, AND UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF.
THE OLD EDDIE THAT KNOWS THE PERCENTAGES AND HOW TO PLAY 'EM,
AND WHATEVER A MAN DOES AWAY FROM THE TABLE IS HIS OWN BUSINESS.
I WANT YOU CHEERFUL AND READY TO HELP ME WITH MY WORK
OR I DON'T WANT YOU COMING THE FUCK OUT!
HMM?
YOU FINISH YOUR SHIFT
AND YOU GO UP THERE TO JOANIE'S ROOM
AND YOU THINK THINGS THROUGH.
ALL RIGHT, EDDIE SAWYER?
!
DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?
WHY DIDN'T YOU VOLUNTEER FOR SOMETHING AT THAT MEETING?
WHY DIDN'T YOU PUT YOUR HAND UP?
MIGHT'VE KEPT YOU FROM BEING SUCH AN EVIL COCKSUCKER.
( dog barking )
SAY HELLO TO THE NEW FIRE MARSHAL.
I'M GETTING OUT.
GOODBYE AND GOOD LUCK.
WAIT ON IT UNTIL YOU AIN'T EXHAUSTED, JANE.
MAYBE YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND.
DIRECTION OF THIS ENTIRE CAMP
MAKES ME SICK,
AND IT BORES THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF ME.
WELL WORKING HOURS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
WOULD GET ANYONE OUT OF SORTS.
AND YOU HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE.
SENT A DOZEN MEN OUT WITH THEIR PLAGUE SORES HEALED
TO GO BACK TO GETTING 'EM ON THEIR JOHNSONS.
I WILL NOT BE A DRUNK WHERE HE'S BURIED.
AND I CANNOT STAY FUCKING SOBER.
SO YOU...
AND EVERY HUMAN BEING ON EARTH--
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE
CAN DRINK MARE'S PISS.
BELIEVE I'LL JUST HAVE WELL WATER.
- SHUT UP, CHARLIE.
- ALL RIGHT.
IF THE SUBJECT COMES UP,
EXPLAIN TO BILL.
ALL RIGHT, JANE.
ALL RIGHT.
TELL THEM OVER AT LIVERY I-
- I'M GOOD FOR THE MOUNT.
DO NOT FUCKING WORRY ABOUT ME.
AND INFORM HOSTETLER AT THE FUCKING LIVERY
YOU SAVED HIS FUCKING LIFE.
ALL RIGHT.
AND DO NOT WORRY ABOUT GETTING PAID BACK.
CHECK THE MAIL, CHARLIE,
AND YOU WILL FIND SOON PROPER PAYMENT.
ALL RIGHT, JANE.
CHECK WITH UTTER MAIL AND CHARLIE FREIGHT!
ALL RIGHT.
SINCE LAST OUR EYES WERE UPON EACH OTHER, LO,
I HOPE YOU'VE EARNED ME $5.
NO.
( clearing throat ) I-
- I GAVE THE LADY YOUR NOTE, SIR.
SHE SAYS TO COME AHEAD, BUT TO KNOCK LOW AS THE LITTLE ONE'S ASLEEP.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, SIR.
( knocking )
EVENING.
GOOD EVENING, MR. BULLOCK.
SOPHIA'S ASLEEP.
SO I WAS TOLD.
SORRY FOR CALLING SO LATE.
I'M TO SEE ELLSWORTH IN THE MORNING AND WONDERED WHAT I SHOULD SAY.
ELLSWORTH SEEMED VERY COMPETENT AND TRUSTWORTHY.
HE SUGGESTED THAT UNTIL THE EXTENT
OF THE QUARTZ DEPOSITS COULD BE PROVED,
HE COULD PROSPECT THE CREEK ON MY CLAIM EACH WEEK
TO KEEP MY TITLE ACTIVE.
HOW'D THAT PLAN SOUND TO YOU?
I FEEL IT'S EXACTLY THE WAY TO PROCEED.
ALL RIGHT THEN.
- WON'T YOU SIT DOWN?
- THANK YOU.
WOULD IT IMPROVE YOUR OPINION OF ME
IF I TOLD YOU I WAS COMMISSIONER OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH?
HOW WONDERFUL.
I SUPPOSE.
IT'S TO PUT THE CAMP'S BEST FOOT FORWARD
AS FAR AS BEING TAKEN INTO THE TERRITORY.
A NUMBER OF MEN TOOK POSITIONS.
- I SEE.
- FARNUM'S MAYOR.
HOW HORRIFYING.
I WROTE TO MY WIFE TODAY.
DID YOU?
ABOUT HER AND MY BOY COMING TO THE CAMP.
YOU HAVE A SON AS WELL?
THEY'RE IN MICHIGAN WITH HER PEOPLE.
MY THINKING WAS
WITH THE TREATY COMING, ANNEXATION,
THE CAMP WOULD BE SETTLING DOWN, A SAFER PLACE.
YES.
- ANY OTHER SONS OR DAUGHTERS?
- NO, THAT'S IT.
MY BROTHER WAS IN THE CAVALRY.
HE WAS KILLED TWO YEARS AGO.
I'M SORRY.
ANYWAYS.
I'M GLAD YOU GOT ALONG WITH ELLSWORTH.
WELL, THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP, MR. BULLOCK.
SURE.
AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW POST
AND THE PROSPECT OF YOUR FAMILY REJOINING YOU.
THANK YOU.
GOOD NIGHT, MRS. GARRET.
GOOD NIGHT.
MAY I ASK WHY YOU SPOKE OF YOUR BROTHER?
MY WIFE WAS HIS WIDOW.
MY BOY IS THEIR CHILD.
I SEE.
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.
( piano music playing )
* BOY, BUDDY BONE, YOU CAN BLOW A MEAN HORN THERE. *
That's what McCall was ridin'.
All right.
Evening.
Evening back.
Look at that paint, Charlie.
I seen it.
I had a happy just like that.
Foundered.
Makes me miserable reminiscing on it.
Do you know the owner?
If he'd sell the horse is what he really wants to know.
Well, I don't know if he'd sell.
But the fuckin' jerk's in that bunkhouse.
- Thank you.
- Evenin'.
Jack McCall.
I'm done.
I don't wanna play no more.
Bein' a loudmouth cunt,
I guess some time since he's been here, this fella who don't wanna play no more probably spoke of killin' Wild Bill Hickok.
Well, we're Bill Hickok's friends.
- I'm Seth Bullock.
- I'm Charlie Utter.
And if you got your head blown off sitting' here with your back turned, that'd be as fair a play as you gave him.
Guess you wanna soften him up some before you make your offer?
My plan is to take him to Yankton for trial.
If you got a different idea, you can ride ahead.
Nah.
Let's take the cocksucker to Yankton.
I don't know of a Henry Anderson in camp, but that don't mean there ain't.
This was took of him in the Union Army.
He'd be 12 years older now.
Could you let her hold it?
With so much showing, it's pretty near falling' apart.
Here.
Third from the middle.
Right uh...
right there?
Yeah.
That face don't- don't look familiar.
Thanks for lookin'.
You definite he's in these hills?
Wrote from Bismarck, said he'd send for us when he got set up.
I just gotta say it's no guarantee your dad's anywhere near this area.
And there's no fuckin' joy in me telling you that, but it's the goddamned truth and the way human beings are.
- Said he'd send for our mother and us.
- Is your mama here?
She passed.
Sorry.
Well, good luck.
Do you know of- of work for me?
- No.
- She can get work right here.
- No, sir.
- No, thank you.
- Can you push a broom?
- And I could start now.
Four bits a day.
I bet you'd like the first in advance.
If you wouldn't mind.
Same for her, as regrets for me being such a ruffian.
Here you go, honey.
If I don't fire him first, you can pick him up at 10:00.
Thank you, sir.
I'll wait for you, Miles.
Find a safe place to wait, you hear?
We teach a special sweeping' technique here.
Follow her lead.
It's all right, son.
It's all right.
Um... excuse me.
I'm required to be at the graveyard.
The Widow Garret is laying her husband to rest.
I'd have bet a month's wages that burial would've took place in New York City, if I had a fuckin' paying' job.
The uh... wet cloth to his lips seems to give him some relief.
- All right.
- Thank you.
What do you think of my patient, Doc?
You might wanna steer clear of his reflection for a while, but you're symptom-free.
You ain't contagious no more and you can't get re-infected, so-
Them as heals under my care stay fuckin' healed.
Thanks, Doc.
I got clothes for you back here.
Hereafter in Calamity, I'll be sure to call for Jane.
You gonna stick around the camp?
I believe I will for a while.
Good, 'cause I wanna monitor your activities, find out what you do that weighs so heavy on your conscience.
When I first come on you in the woods, all you could say was, "I apologize. "
Before you exhibit your Johnson, I'm gonna see to this fella.
So long.
Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you.
- All right.
- You're on your own for alterations.
- Hmm.
Now I'm gonna lay this cloth on your fuckin' lips.
There's Mr. Star to collect us.
Mr. Star has been ever so attentive.
- Very considerate.
- To you.
When we leave the hotel, my boss will be watchin'.
Shall I reel and stagger?
I...
I know the risk lying to him has put you to.
I've
- I can't imagine why I'd make it the subject of humor.
You're feeling better.
- Am I early?
- Good morning, Mr. Star.
I'll be ready in just a moment.
- I can have a cup of coffee downstairs.
- No, not at all.
Wait, wait in here, with Trixie.
I'll just be a moment.
That widow ain't high.
Maybe waiting till after the service.
When she'd wanna get good and fucking loaded is before the fucking service, against all the fucking carrying on.
- What do you think?
- Makes sense.
Meaning all that whore's been telling me the last 10 fucking days about seeing the widow taking the dope, and your own fucking assurances, you verify that she's loaded personally- you're both full of shit.
I checked in on the woman daily.
If I was fooled, perhaps I've chosen simplemindedness, Al, over realizing a certain friend has used me as an instrument of purposes he concealed.
Say what you're gonna say, or prepare for eternal fucking silence.
I don't believe you commissioned me to make an offer on the widow's claim to keep the regulators off you, Al.
I think someone found something out there you want.
Assume you ain't been privy to the ins and outs of that matter for the sake of fucking conversation, huh?
I mean, was I asleep, E.B., when you and me declared undying loyalty and full faith mutual disclosure about every fucking detail of every fucking move
- we were ever gonna make together?
- You used me as a pawn, Al.
And you fucked up the game is the central fucking present issue.
We agreed on 2,000.
You want a fucking percentage instead?
Is that such an inconceivable proposition?
- Yeah, you got a percentage, E.B.
- How big?
2% of the first million, half a percent after.
You wanna feel a damp palm, Al, select either of these hands.
Just get to the funeral, E.B. Go to 20 if you have to.
Just get that fucking claim.
20 if I have to.
My word.
What a handsome man.
Wish I could tell you I recognize him.
Thank you anyway.
- Your dad, I expect.
- Yes.
You have reason to think he's out here?
He wrote us from Bismarck he'd be prospecting the hills.
- "Us" being?
- My brother.
He just got work over here.
Good for him.
So it's just the two of you?
Our mother passed, why we come from Buffalo.
- You're out here looking for your dad.
- Yes.
- Uh, Henry?
- Yes.
Out here looking for her father, Eddie.
Her and her older brother.
Got a photograph, I don't...
I don't recognize the likeness.
No.
- Henry Anderson?
- Yes.
- Yeah, I don't recognize him.
- Mm.
What are you gonna do while your brother works?
Work too, while we're looking to set aside, if we have to move on.
Ah, if Dad doesn't turn up here.
Yeah, what do you do?
Cook, clean, sew, sweep.
Uh-huh.
- How quick do you learn?
- Guess I learn pretty quick.
Maestro.
We are strangers and sojourners.
Mr. Garret's burial place is a great distance from New York City.
But his heart...
Ingrid...
Marta.
- And on the great day...
- Mama.
- his Father will take him into it.
- Papa.
As He will all who confess His Son savior from wherever we may be put to rest.
Our hymn is "A Mighty Fortress. "
Amightyfortress is our God
Abulwark never failing...
- My sympathies, madam,
- Our helper... but, my own requirements force me to ignore what's seemly.
I must decide where to place my capital.
Might raising my offer to say, $19,500, uh, prompt you to an immediate answer?
- No, Mr. Farnum.
- Doth seek to work us woe
LordSabbath, His name
- His craft and power...
- I would as soon not see Bill now.
I'll see him some other time.
Come on.
Onearthis not His equal...
I will require a decision within 24 hours-
Please, stop speaking to me, Mr. Farnum.
Didwein ourown strength confide
Ourstriving would be losing
Werenottherightman by our side...
Themanof God's own choosing.
I hope you ain't gived up on that little runt of a girl, Al.
Oh, do you worry for her, Dan?
Wandering the muck of our thoroughfare, her tiny self all but swallowed up in horseshit?
Hey, kid!
Come here.
- Yes, sir?
- Stand with us here a second.
What are- what are we doing?
Waiting.
And out the door he'll go, and prompt as a Swiss fucking timepiece three big-tittied whores will now emerge from behind that screen.
He lines 'em up at two-foot intervals, smock tops down, and all but sprints past 'em, giving their titties a lick.
And if he misses a titty, does not let himself retrace his steps.
- Don't tell me.
- Yeah, then he goes on his way home, relieved for the day.
What's your name?
It's Miles, huh?
- Miles, yeah.
- Yeah.
Strange, huh, Miles?
But something you gotta know about specialists.
They pay a premium and they never cause fucking trouble.
I sometimes imagine in my declining years running a small joint in Manchester, England, catering to specialists exclusive.
And to let 'em know they're amongst their own, I'll operate from the corner, hanging upside down like a fucking bat, hmm?
- We're not such bad sorts here, huh?
- No, sir.
So do you wanna ask your sister if she'd like to reconsider, hmm?
- You don't really mean that.
- Of course I don't mean it.
How dare you suggest I'd mean a thing like that, huh?
I did my part.
Raised our offer to 20 and demanded answer within the day.
But what, you cocksucker?
Complications have ensued:
Bullock's come back.
I expect she'll wanna take counsel with him.
Tell the whore I wanna see her.
And I trust this doesn't alter our agreement.
I trust you know 2% of nothing's fucking nothing.
That fella from Montana
I knew to trust won't be able to assay your claim.
I see.
We'll engage someone local, and I'll keep an eye on him.
As I've decided to stay in camp, Mr. Bullock, at least for the near term,
I hope you'll feel absolved of those responsibilities towards my interest that you undertook at Mr. Hickok's request.
I prefer to see 'em through.
They're properly mine.
I even feel marginally capable of shouldering them and I certainly realize that you and Mr. Star have responsibilities of your own.
Are you firing me, Mrs. Garret?
I'm offering you absolution.
Otherwise I'm staying on.
I'm so sorry you were hurt.
So, how hard are they coming at you to sell?
I could confide that in an effort to blur my judgment,
Mr. Swearengen engaged intermediaries to indulge me with opium.
But that would entail acknowledging that
I've had a weakness in that direction.
Uh... more appropriately, uh, I could add at the graveyard Mr. Farnum raised his offer
$7,500, presumably also on Mr. Swearengen's instruction, and set a 24-hour limit to my reply.
Under the circumstances, I'd say that's coming pretty hard.
Please forgive me for making you uncomfortable, Mr. Bullock.
I had better manners before I began to abstain.
That's all right.
Anyways, are you at risk for the smallpox?
I was inoculated in New York City.
The child whose life you saved presumably has not been, but I assume she's safer under my care than traveling in a covered wagon with strangers.
Anyways, I'll line up the assayer.
Thank you.
You are changed.
You seem to be too.
Our stock's depleted, but we are offering a 100% discount on any item that catches your eye.
I've got money.
Our special get- acquainted-with-those- we'd-like-to-get- acquainted-with sale.
Mr. Utter.
I brought these pickaxes for you to sell.
There's two sifters on that black cayuse out there.
Mighty grateful, sir.
You got this place just about built, don't you?
Saving the last master-strokes for Seth.
Oh, hello.
I didn't see you.
Hello.
Hey, that's that little girl, isn't it?
Taking care of her for Mrs. Garret.
As much as she favors you, she could be yours.
I lost the receipts for my costs.
Maybe while you was busy saving my partner's life.
Let me get these sifters for you.
See if you can make those accounts add up.
I don't know if you heard me inside thanking you for helping my friend.
I heard you.
It's all right.
I'm sorry you lost yours.
All right.
Thank you.
Welcome back, Mr. Utter.
We've had a mild increase in rates, but I do have a room available.
I'll see.
What do you want, Mr. Farnum?
I have a message for Trixie that's looking to that orphan child.
- She's to see her longer-term employer.
- I'll tell her.
You know who that is?
I know she works at The Gem.
And even so, admit her to your trade at public hours.
Congratulations, sir, on your advanced thinking.
Al wants you, Trixie.
Stickler for self-delivered messages.
Our dad ain't here.
I know it, even if my brother don't.
Maybe he never even tried to get here.
Or maybe he did try to get here and couldn't, maybe something happened to him.
There's so many ways it could be, Flora, it's not much point deciding which it was.
He'd never think that, though, my brother.
Must be how he needs to do.
I ain't a virgin- if you wanna know that.
I had a boyfriend in Buffalo.
Well, was you upset to have to leave him?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
I was upset.
At the same time he was a stupid son of a bitch.
And rough.
Here.
You can't tell my brother about him.
He'd make it back to Buffalo and shoot Lewis in the head.
All that way in defense of your virtue?
That's more trouble than I ever took with it.
Cy.
Lazarus risen.
Look at you, you son of a gun.
Hello, Cy.
Good to see you, Andy.
Don't be afraid to shake with me, Eddie.
I ain't contagious no more.
Highly becoming outfit.
I'm here for my belongings.
Look... they're gone, Andy.
Measures to stop the spread.
Ah hell, the important thing is you're well.
I'll front you whatever you need.
Let's get something going, hmm?
- Andy?
- In the flesh, sweetheart.
- Which ain't much to look at.
- You made it, Andy.
Oh, and we ain't getting nothing going.
All I come back for, Cy, was my things, and you tossed them too.
Why don't you take this and get yourself outta that clown outfit?
Once you've cooled off a little, think how you'd have done different when somebody showed up in the shape you was in and my responsibilities to meet.
Better than to throw him in the woods to fucking die?
Then don't think about nothing, Andy.
Use the money for a whore and a toot and go join the fucking circus.
Did you turn her out?
Her brother's gonna be a problem.
Fuck her brother.
We'll handle the brother if we have to kill the cocksucker.
That's an interesting piece of strange.
Ain't you a picture?
- What is it?
- Hmm?
Oh, am I detaining you in some way?
Am I fucking imposing?
Mrs. Garret's to sit down with Bullock.
I thought you'd want me over there.
Oh yeah, so you can bring me a full and fair report, huh?
But will the widow have her wits about her, Trixie, huh?
Or will they be passing the opium pipe like heathens between 'em, her and fucking Bullock, hmm?
- What're you pissed off for?
- I ain't pissed off.
I'm in fucking wonderment.
I'm waiting to be kept happy by the next fucking fairy tale.
Do you want me back at the hotel or do you wanna do something to me?
Now why would I want you to go back there, huh?
Or rely on anything you said transpired after you lied about her taking dope, huh?
Her being high... wasn't gonna have nothing to do with whether or not she sold you that claim, and she wanted to get off the dope.
And that little one needs someone to care for her... and maybe get her the fuck outta here.
And I knew it wasn't gonna be me.
So you want me back over there and to tell you what they fucking decide?
Or do you wanna rip my fucking guts out?
You get back there quick.
Don't kid yourself, Trixie.
Don't get a mistaken idea.
Mr. Utter.
This is where Bill got killed, huh?
Uh...
I'll be sorry about that for as long as I live.
Can you tell me about it?
Yeah.
It- it was about sun-up over at that Bella Union joint,
Mr. Hickok plum gutted McCall at draw.
And now here Mr. Hickok was at poker again.
Say a couple hours of daylight left and in come that coward McCall.
Walked up on him and shot him in the head.
Bill never know when he come in.
Uh, those of us that did, we didn't have no inkling of what he intended.
He just murdered him, right where he sat.
If I may, sir...
This is here where
Wild Bill was sitting when McCall entered from the front, approached the table, causing no apprehension 'cause he had often frequented the game.
Of a sudden, McCall produced a revolver and shouting "Take that, damn you!" He fired.
Muzzle couldn't have been three inches from Wild Bill's head.
Now I'm told that Hickok fell dead immediately, but I won't testify to it, because the bullet, after it passed through Wild Bill's brain, struck me in my right wrist, and I lost several seconds to pain before regaining my senses.
Sir, you have my word as eyewitness to the rest, and I suppose this wound as added proof for the doctors they feared crippled me in the hand I use to write.
I will take the murderer's bullet to my grave.
Thanks.
Aces over eights, as I just now recall.
That is the hand that Wild Bill had.
Sure, Captain.
Sure.
You like how that falls?
Sure.
- Do you like it, Flora?
- Why not?
I'd prefer you happy, honey, but if you can't be, you need to pretend at it better than you're doing or you're gonna be hungry and cold and getting done to you for nothing outside
what you'd have made money to live on and save up besides if you acted the part in here.
I thought I only had to act it with them that wanna stick it in me.
You never know who that might be, Flora.
There you go.
I prefer you happy.
Or at least pretending better?
I think he's dead, Doc.
Could you tell the litter bearers not to make so much of getting this one outta here?
- Has young Joey gone to dust?
- Yeah.
As flesh must, to be restored by the Savior's return.
Oh, Mr. Bullock is back among us, and also, also Mr. Utter.
Does Charlie know about Bill?
They were together, Mr. Bullock and he.
They'd captured Jack McCall.
I hope that's only the beginning of what they fucking did to him.
- Gave him over to federal authorities.
- Gave him over?
- Rendered unto Caesar.
- Jesus Christ.
Mr.
- Mr. Bullock was struck by an Indian's axe.
Marked like the first-born of Adam and Eve.
- Are you drunk?
- No.
- What the fuck is that?
- He's all right.
All right, Reverend.
All right, Reverend.
All right.
You're all right, Reverend.
All right.
He marks us sinful and forgiven by confession.
All right.
He has told us and shown us.
He has told me.
All right.
You listen to me now, Reverend.
You are goddamn exhausted, and you give yourself no respite.
These seizures may owe something to that, but it also wouldn't surprise me if you had a lesion in your goddamn head, and that's what's giving you the seizures and generating your chats with the goddamn divinity.
No goddamn offense intended.
- None taken, sir.
- Now get outta here,
- and get yourself some rest!
- Go on, Reverend.
Doc's tired too, the only reason he's talking so fucking harsh.
Could not the lesion be the instrument of God's instructive intention, Doctor, if I am so afflicted?
Well, of course it could,
His ways not being ours and so forth.
But could He not, Reverend, just want you getting out of here and getting yourself some goddamn rest?
- You have to go now.
- We don't have to do nothing,
I'd pay the same price just to sit with you.
My brother works in this place up here, and he keeps a hard watch.
If you wanna stick it in me tomorrow, you better let me go in by myself.
- What time are you gonna start?
00, I guess.
I'll be receiving around noon.
All right, Flora.
Here's a dollar anyway.
You're swell.
Evening.
Evening, miss.
- You're early.
- Yes.
- I guess no luck finding your dad.
- No, no luck.
I knew you would've had a cheerier look on your face if you had.
Let me get you a place to sit away from these rough sons of bitches.
Hey!
Do your drinking at the bar or get the fuck out of here!
You have a seat here.
I'll get you a beverage.
Do you want a soft cider or a sarsaparilla?
- Cider if it's not a trouble.
- Soft cider.
Did she find her dad?
Her chances of finding her dad are greater than yours of walking out of this door upright, unless you shut your fucking mouth.
You got it?
Swearengen's had his hand on the tiller far as getting dealing with this epidemic.
Is that so?
Yeah, the dead don't drink or chase women must be his thinking on that subject.
That Indian fought like hell.
I'd guess you did too.
Charlie figured out how it must have been.
The Indian had to kill me for coming on the burial place, and maybe it had been me, too, that killed his friend, cut his friend's head off so he wouldn't have eyes to see the sunset
all those years he'd be lying there dead.
So he had to kill me for that too.
And he couldn't before he'd laid hands on me or the killing wouldn't be honorable.
We fought like fucking hell, I'll tell you that much, and I never once had the upper-hand.
It just happened out the way it happened out.
He was just trying to live, same as me, and do honor to his friend, and make some fucking sense out of things.
And we wind up that way, and I wind up after beating him till I couldn't recognize his face.
For Christ's sake!
That Indian saved Jack McCall's life,
- I'll tell you that fucking much.
- Not for long.
Brian MacDonald's not coming.
I want his recommendation who should assay that widow's claim.
- Whose?
- Swearengen's.
Shit, Seth.
Get his opinion, too, who should guard that henhouse we're gonna build.
So... are you okay?
- Yes, and you?
- Yes.
They're nice here.
And Mr. Swearengen, he's funny as all get-out.
So what place would make a better score?
Where I'm working.
But why not take 'em both?
- Could we have a private talk?
- Sure we can.
- Should I be armed?
- Where do you wanna talk?
Come here.
What do you think of that?
I think that son of a bitch better stop looking evil at that little girl.
So was it McCall improved your appearance?
No.
Whoever got the job done, I hope you gave as good as you got.
It's good to have you back, with me being superstitious and all hell breaking loose when you left.
I'm here to talk about Mrs. Garret.
They planted her husband this morning?
I wrote a man about coming to assay her claim,
- but he can't make it.
- Plenty of local alternatives.
I want you to nominate someone.
Do you?
So if any way his work was mistaken,
I'd be coming after you.
- You would?
- Yeah.
Since I got nothing to do with the venture, what if I decline to make the recommendation?
Then you better hope whoever I find does his job right, 'cause I'm still holding you accountable.
I ain't involved.
E.B. Farnum offered on her claim.
Farnum's your water-boy and I know what you've been trying to do to her.
So here you come in all nobility... threatening me with a dire result if the property of that widow's husband thought worthless from when it sold, turns out not to be pinched out.
You and I know how it is, Mr. Swearengen.
- How what is?
- She gets a square shake, or I come for you.
What if I come for you?
Are you ready for that?
I guess I'd better be.
Then close your fucking store, 'cause being ready for me will take care of your waking hours and you better have someone to hand the task off to when you close your eyes.
We understand each other.
Al!
Al!
Jesus fucking Christ!
Walk right past me, Your Holiness, so I can shut my fucking office.
Al!
Go on!
Stare at her now!
Huh?
You like fucking little girls?
Take a look at that little girl 'cause she's the last thing you're ever gonna see.
- Stare at her now, cocksucker.
- Let him down!
Let him fucking down!
Or should I have had him hold him up?
You heard what I said about the widow.
Oh yes, Your Holiness.
You heard me too.
So I take it this was a fair fucking fight, yeah?
Yeah!
That's right!
Two free drinks for everybody.
And drinks all night for them that help with the disposal.
That's me!
I'm sorry that you had to see that.
Shut the fuck up, Dan, and get her the fuck away from here- now!
Come on.
I'm sorry, Mr. Swearengen.
I warned him not to look at her.
I warned him.
Fucking pussy.
That Joey passed this afternoon.
Been suffering awful.
But that frog-looking fellow left the tent that I found up in the woods, left the tent fucking cure pronounced by the Doc himself.
And in the dumbest looking outfit a grown man ever wore.
Who's there, God damn it?
!
Who the hell's it look like?
How the fuck do I know who it fucking looks like?
It's dark!
Jesus Christ, come upon a person unawares in a fucking graveyard!
I heard you was back in the camp.
I heard you and that Bullock got the cocksucker did for Bill.
Was Bill dead by the time you saw him?
Yeah, he was already dead.
Why did he let that son of a bitch get to him?
I don't know, Charlie.
Anyways, people don't scare me past speaking,
I come up here nights tell him the fucking news.
Go ahead.
Charlie avenged your fucking murder.
And that Bullock fella was with me that you seemed to like.
Although it occurred to me to wonder why they didn't do for the cocksucker right on the fucking spot.
Is that something we need to get into in front of him?
You got the biggest mouth in the territory.
You talk to him.
Tell him whatever you want.
I got that mall route in Cheyenne that we talked about.
I was bringing back supplies to them hardware boys and I run into that Bullock fella.
He was out there looking for that McCall that- that killed you.
And he run into some heathen boy and he had one hell of a fight.
Boy, and he just- he got- he got f-
Fuck.
Can I- can I tell him some more tomorrow?
Sure, what the fuck you asking me for?
I don't make the rules.
Wanna go back to the camp?
Please.
And what must Mr. Bullock have been thinking as I inflicted my personal confidences upon him?
- I don't know.
- Nor do I.
At least he kept a decent privacy.
I have to go back to The Gem.
He's waiting for me now to tell him yours and Mr. Bullock's thinking about selling the claim, and I won't be able to lie anymore.
Next I tell will be my last.
So I better just get back there.
Mr. Swearengen discovered our deception?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Looking at you walk out of the hotel.
- He did not.
I was careful to see he wasn't watching in the window.
It don't matter, Mrs. Garret.
The point is, I gotta go back.
And you need someone to look to this child, and with choices bigger elsewhere and nothing I can tell to hold you here, maybe you better think about selling and getting out.
Would you wanna take the girl and go?
Where?
- I have no people anywhere.
- You could go to New York.
I
- I could have my relatives there see you established.
What the fuck?
What would keep you here?
You wanna fuck this man?
Fuck him, then think about the child-
Don't use that language with me, Trixie, or that tone-
Don't you wanna say to remember my place?
I do, you rich cunt.
And I'm going back to it.
She's about to say her name, you know.
She named her sisters and her folks.
Think of selling.
If you took her away, you could hear her say it.
Oldfriend

Hey fellas.
Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
Timmy!
Say fellas, Timmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next Sssaturday.
We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.
The Special Olympics?
What's so special about them?
They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
Dude, what?
Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Thanks a lot, fellas.
Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out.
Word is we have a lot of ssstiff competition this year.
Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
Timmy!
Dude.
I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this.
I mean making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
...You're an asshole, Cartman.
What?
What did I do?
...six!
...
Timmih.
Usss-usss-seven!
Timmih.
Timmih!
Usss-usss-seven!
Timmih!
Timmiiih!
Ni-I can'
- I can't!
Huff.
Oh man.
Gee whiz, Timmy.
It looks like we have some ppppretty stiff competition this year.
All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven ru-reps...
Huhh oh well, that's it for me, Timmy.
I'm p-p-pooped.
I'll see you in the locker room.
Otimmih.
Hey Jimmy, g-good luck on Saturday.
You too, Francis.
Hey Jimmy.
Oh hey hey, n-Nathan.
So uh, I see you train pretty hard.
Yeah, it sure is tough.
I'm training really hard, but I'm not improvingfast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away.
Wellll, maybe I can
- Help you out You know, there are shortcuts.
What kind of shortcuts?
You know.
Steroids.
S
- S...
Ss-s-s-steroids?
...But aren't those illegal?
Yeah, sure, but these are new.
They don't show up in our urine tests.
So uh, ha-how do they... w-wwork?
You just take one of these little blue babies three times a day and inject this directly into your bloodstream twice a day before meals.
How much would this cost me?
Ahhh it isn't cheap.
I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas.
Well...
Then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit.
You know, as a per-formance en...
Hancer.
Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend.
Whatever you say.
YOU GUYS!
YOU GUYS!
I have the best idea ever!
I'm gonna be rich!
What?
Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out:
"At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"
So?
So?
So dude, think about it.
If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
Oh no.
Cartman, no!
It's flawless!
I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicappeds!
That's really, really terrible, dude.
Terrible?
Whatever!
You guys's brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can!
It'll work, you'll see.
Cartman!
I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
Why?
Because.
What are you gonna do, Kyle?
Tell on me?
Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale!
Is that really how you deal with your problems?
Grow up, Kyle!
All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars.
It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
Darrrr.
Durrrr.
I wanna be in the Special Olympics.
Bull's eye!
Oh!
Agh!
Just, just a second!
Hang on, I'm I'm, coming.
Jim, it's your father!
I said I'm coming!
Give me a Goddamned s-second!
Jimmy, were you masturbating?
Nn-no, Dad.
Okay.
Well, you have a visitor.
Hi Jimmy.
Oh.
Hi, N-N-Nancy.
I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow.
Oh.
Sure thing.
Come on in.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim.
Yeah, Dad.
We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.
I'll leave you two alone.
Y
- You sure you weren't masturbating Jim?
It's okay if you were.
Dad, Jesus C-Christ!
Okay then.
Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.
Hey guys, what's going on?
Drrrrrt.
God damn you!
You see, gentlemen?
The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.
I'm going to go sign up now.
No you're not!
I read the brochure, Cartman!
If you're under eighteen you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
What?
It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up,"
...and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so HA!
Moooommmmm?
Yes, hon?
Um, could I get you to do something for me?
What's that, hon?
Um, okay.
This is goin' ta sound a little strange.
Um, but, stick with me.
Um, moommm?
Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars?
Oh...
Nno, sweetie.
I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.
I'm not special?
I thought you always said I was special.
You are, hon, but...
I don't think that's a very good idea.
...I'll split the money with you.
...I'm sorry, Eric.
The answer is No.
All right, Mom, look.
Here's...
The truth.
God, this is gonna be hard to say.
I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past.
I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but now I'm starting to think...
That if I could just spend one day in their shoes if I could just see the challenges they face every day.
Maybe I wouldn't be so cold.
I just want a chance to change.
Help me change?
Oh, a-a-all right, sweetie, I, I'll take you tomorrow.
Awesome.
You did a great job in the 500, Timmy You really im-...
P-p-proved.
Timmih!
I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition.
Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen.
Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-tim.
Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?
Timmih!
Tim-Tim?
Oh, uh, so...
Hey Timmy...

Timmih.
T...
T-Timmih.

Tell anybody, are you?
Huh!
Timmih!
T-Timmih!
Look, it's my body and it's my choice what I put in it!
Timmih!
Timmih, Jimmih.
Arrrh Timmih!
Jimmih!
Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship.
You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete.
I'm just trying to k-keep up.
Huh...
Timmih...
Timmih.
Sssso what are you gonna do now, huh?
You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that bbottle to the...
Coaches?
Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy I'm just living in the real world!

R-r-really hard.
You keep going like this and you'll break Special Olympics records on Saturday!
Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in?
Yup.

How I Will Spend My...
One Thousand Dollars...
By Eric Cartman...
Enter!
Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive.
Go on, Kyle.
I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell.
So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct.
Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish.
Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-
I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
Let me finish.
If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews and all those who don't accept Christ.
That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
I came here to talk about you!
Yes.
And instead you had to break through yourself.
This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.
Good luck.
Come on, push it!
Push it!
Yeah.
Nice p-pecs.
Sweet b-biceps.
Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop.
The Games are in two days, Nancy I can't be w-wasting my time.
I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time.
Oh Jeez!
Are you gonna start running your mouth off again?
P
- Push it!
Push it!
Jimmy, everyone's worried about you.
You seem...
Different.
Theh-they're all just...
Jealous.
You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period.
I'm leaving you.
You're not leaving me!
You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!
You can't treat people like this!
I said, shut your mouth, bitch!
Why did you make me do it, huh?
You're not leavin' anybody!
You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told!
What the?
Jimmy, oh my God!
Stay away from me, you stupid bbbbitches!
No!
God!
Welcome, everyone, to the 2004 Special Olympics!
We will be holding various throughout the day, and at the end of it all we will have some very special celebrity athletes here to present the trophy for top athlete along with the cash prize of one thousand dollars.
Top athlete, yeah!
One thousand dollars, yeah!
So let's have all our athletes report to their first assigned events and...
Let the Games begin!
Will those athletes in heat 1 of the hundred-meter dash please report to Track Aread B.
Okay, racers, are we ready?
Take your marks.
Daaaa!
Daaaa!
On your marks!
Get set!
Go!
Whoa.
What the hell?
Great job, everyone.
You three advance to the next heat.
All right!
Good Job.
We did it!
Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
Yeeessss!
Yes!
Yes!
He's got it!
That's a new Special Olympics record, folks!
God-damnit!
Winner, Jimmy Valmer!
All right, this one I can win!
Here, hold this!
I'll show you Goddamned retards!
God-damnit!
That's another Special Olympics record!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah, I did it!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ladies and Gentlemen, our day of competition has come to an end and we have an ultimate grand special champion for 2004!
Here to present the award are baseball legends Mark McGuire, Jason Giambi, and Barry Bonds.
The two thousand and four special athlete is...
Jimmy Valmer.
Yeah!
Fuck yeah!
Yeah, I did it!
I'm the bbub-best!
Congratulations, Jimmy.
But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning.
And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last.
Eric Cartman!
Ah, screw you hippie!
For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey's for fifty dollars!
Come on up, Eric!
...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.
Uh, Drrrr!
Drrrr!
Hey!
Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?
Uhh, hehe.
Uh de-duhhhh.
You ffffaked being handicapped to win?
I should k-kick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-ch...
Cheater!
Timmih!
What?
Oh my God.
You, you're right, Timmy.
You're totally right.
Everyone, can I have your attention, please?
I'm afraid I have to give back my medal.
The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either.
I've been using st-steroids.
I was willing to do anything to be the best and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting.
A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him.
Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics.
Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game.
But I know now that even if you do win on steroids you're really not a winner.
You're just a p-pussy.
You're just a big fat p-p...
P...
Pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say...
"Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy-"
"
- Steroid-taking jackass. "
That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books.
And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year.
To compete with honor.
Hey kid.
Good for you for being honest.
Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along.
I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.
Eh, oh yeah?
Well, well you guys are assholes!
Grow up!
Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity.
Approaching planet Omega Nine.
Warp drive disengaged.
Landing sequence initiated.
What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
I'm a Vulcan!
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
All right, hang on.
We're about to land.
Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team.
Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
- No!
I'm on the away team too!
- It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
I don't care!
You're not making me wait in the van again!
Fine, Kyle!
But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
Set phasers on stun.
- Things seem pretty quiet.
- Yes.
A little too quiet.
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C.
I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge.
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for
- Oh no!
Look out!
It's a giant four-headed lava frog!
Shoot it!
Oh no, it got Kyle!
No it doesn't.
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!
Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for.
No I'm not!
Goddamnit Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
Agh!
You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
Shut up about Jews, fatass!
You don't know anything!
Oh God, here we go again.
Oh yeah?
!
I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
He does not!
How do you know?
!
I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle!
You haven't seen it once!
There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do?
They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
- Naw uh!
- Go see the movie, Kyle!
That does it!
I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion!
I'm out of here.
I'm not arguing about The Passion!
He's being an asshole!
You know what it is?
You're scared.
You're scared of the truth.
You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are,
- and why everyone hates you.
- People don't hate the Jews!
Really?
Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle.
The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle.
Those numbers don't lie.
If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it.
Go see it and tell me I'm wrong.
Mel Gibson, Kyle.
Mel Gibson.
...You're a stupid asshole!
Sweeet, now I can just play with myself.
Get back in the shuttlecraft!
One please.
This is an R-rated movie.
Yeah, I know, but I have to-
But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ,
I'll let you in to see it.
...Thanks.
How?
How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
Pretty brutal, isn't it?
Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?
"And now, back to Terrance and Phillip" Hey Terrance, I think I have a-
Mom!
Doorbell!
Mom!
Answer the door!
Goddamnit, lazy-ass whore.
You were right...
You were right all along...
I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but...
I didn't know, I...
I didn't know.
It's okay, Kyle.
It's okay.
Just... say that first part again?
You were right?
Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
You were right.
I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me.
You have shown me the way so many times in the past and...
now you are making all my dreams come true.
You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.
Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth.
From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone.
I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding.
Hail Mel Gibson.
Amen.
Look at that, dude.
The Passion has made almost 400 milliion dollars at the box office now.
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie.
I guess... we have to ge see it too.
Dude.
That movie sucked.
How can they even call that a movie?
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was.
Me neither.
Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on!
I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus.
Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing.
Hey, we want our money back.
Huh?
That movie sucked ass.
Give us back our eighteen dollars.
I can't refund your money.
You sat through the whole movie.
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for YOUR SINS!
We go to church to learn that stuff!
We go to movies to be entertained!
We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
I'm now allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie!
You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.
W- what?
Mel Gibson?
You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
Yeah.
I'd like to see you try.
Oh, we will!
This is America!
And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back!
Come on, Kenny!
- Kill him!
Guilty!
Kill him!
- Kill him!
Kill him!
Die!
Kill Jesus!
Yesss!
Okay, search for Mel Gibson.
Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page.
Here we go.
Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion. com, your source for everything Mel.
Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects.
Damnit, no phone number!
Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.. "
Okay, okay, wait, here we go.
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now.
Our first meeting is at 5:30 p. m.
Nonono, no, we want our money back
What?
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars.
Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
You thought it sucked?
Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do!
He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew.
It has made people the world over open their eyes.
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir.
All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu.
Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid!
I'll kick your ass!
Ohoh yeah?
!
I'd like to see you try, asshole!
I'm like six feet tall!
I don't care!
You sound like a little bitch to me!
Bitch?
!
Don't call me bitch!
I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
Yeah?
!
You wanna bring it, you little pussy?
!
I already brought it, bitch!
I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
Wait a minute.
Cartman?
!
Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!
We'll take the bus!
Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore.
This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!
This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
- Oh, that's great, sweetie.
- Tell them I'll be down shortly
Okay, hon.
TС†ten sie die Juden!
Wir kС†nnen nicht stillstehen bis sie alle tot sind!
Okay, I'm ready.
I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson.
Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?
No.
Actually, we're guests as well.
I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise.
Hello.
I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.
Oh I agree.
There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion.
It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.
And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.
Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?
Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!
It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives.
Ah hello everyone.
Achtung.
My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.
Ah thank you, thank you.
I'm happy to see that all of you. were affected by The Passion like I was.
Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
We sure do.
But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.
- Wha, what does that mean, sweetie?
- I'm not sure, but-uh.
Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together.
The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Now, in order to do what we all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support.
I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
Oh, what a great idea!
We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!
Heheh great!
Yeah!
Great idea.
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
- We sure do!
- Yeah.
All right.
Woohoo!
Thank you.
This must be the place.
Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded.
Yes?
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
You can't not like The Passion!
I just followed the Bible!
Christ died for you.
Go home.
Look, dude, we came a long way.
We're not leaving until you give us our money.
Oh yeah?
Well you're gonna have to find it first.
But I won't tell you where I keep my money.
You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!
Tor-torture you?
Ha!
So you DO intend to torture me, huh?
!
Well go ahead!
Do your worst!
You STILL won't get your ticket money back!
I can take whatever you can dish out!
We don't want to torture you.
I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?
!
Well go ahead!
I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
I have to use that money to build my church!
I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church!
And do you know why?
!
So I can play banjo!
Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!
Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!
How dare you call me crazy!
This means war!
And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins.
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
...What is troubling you, my child?
Well, I have this friend, see?
And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel.
And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
Ah!
You mean he's a Jew!
Right.
But he can't live with the guilt anymore.
Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy.
And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie.
I I can't sleep at night.
I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
Yes, The Passion is very powerful.
The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion.
The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.
But how can the Jews make it better?
Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus.
Remember:
Christianity is about... atonement.
Wait.
That's it.
Atonement.
Of course.
I know what I have to do now.
Thank you, Father.
Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker
You wanna get outta here?
Talk to me.
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!
Wait!
There's his wallet!
Freedom!
Jesus is Lord!
All right, let's get the hell out of here!
When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!
Run, dude, run!
And good evening, friends!
One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters.
And now, we proud few gathere here as a people brought together by its message!
Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!
Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
- What a great idea!
- It'll be like a parade!
Good idea!
And as we march for The Pasion we should also voice our support!
So, when I say "Es ist Zeit fСЊr SРuberung,"
you all chant back "Wir mСЊssen die Juden ausrotten. "
Well, what does that mean, dear?
Oh, I think it's Aramaic.
You know, like in the movie.
Ooo, Aramaic.
Cool.
What was our Aramaic line again?
Wir mСЊssen die Juden ausrotten!
Wir mСЊssen die Juden ausrotten.
Es ist Zeit fСЊr Rache!
Wir mСЊssen die Juden ausrotten.
Oh huh, this is fun!
All right, everyone!
Forward, march!
Es ist Zeit fСЊr Rache!
Wir mСЊssen die Juden ausrotten.
- Es ist Zeit fСЊr Rache!
- Wir mСЊssen die Juden ausrotten.
Nice.
Shalom hak nak shalom.
And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congragation.
Thank you, rabbi.
In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery.
In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust.
And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
What?
Whatwhatwhaaat?
!
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
Oh my God!
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?
!
- I saw The Passion.
- Oh no!
The Passion?
!
This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having!
- Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.
- Stereotyping Jews is terrible.
Something must be done to stop that movie!
Now, now, everyone calm down.
We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie.
There's no cause for alarm.
- Wir mСЊssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit fСЊr Rache!
- Wir mСЊssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit fСЊr Rache!
- Wir mСЊssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit fСЊr Rache!
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty...
seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.
But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
Oh, you've got to be shittin' me.
Give me back my money!
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.
Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
Huh?
Mel Gibson is chasing after us.
You've gotta go faster.
Haha, very funny, kid.
Sit down and stop playing games.
I'm not playing games.
Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna-
What the hell?
- Hey!
That's Mel Gibson!
- Yeah.
I told you that!
Well, what the hell does he want?
!
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
You didn't like The Passion?
But it shows how Christ suffered for you.
Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man.
You guys, stop!
Please.
You're gonna make people hate us more.
Can I help you?
This movie is causing anti-Semitism!
You must remove it from your theater!
That's right!
Yeah!
Remove your movie!
Remove it from the theater?
Fat chance!
- We demand you stop showing it!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Nonono!
Don't become an angry mob!
The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
Juden!
- What's going on here?
- They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.
This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!
Nonsense!
Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man!
There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!
It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!
Well, maybe you should apologize.
- That's right!
What he said.
- How dare you?
!
Look out!
Give me my eighteen dollars!
Mel!
Gibson!
Oh mein Savior!
Mein FСЊhrer!
You're actually here!
Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses!
We are ready to do thy bidding!
Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?
!
So!
You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh?
I guess now you're gonna start torturing me!
Well!
Oh, my nipples are so tender!
Ddon't squeeze them anymore!
That's...
Mel Gibson?
H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.
Well.
I guess you wanna torture me now, don't you?
!
Dude, what's wrong with him?
He's kookoo, dude.
He's absolutely out of his mind.
You!
You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you?
Okay, fine.
See what you can fit in there, I can take it!
Dude!
I've been freaked out this whole time because of THAT guy's movie?
Fine!
If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!
It's our eighteen dollars!
Your movie sucked!
You can't say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked!
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed.
Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
You know, he's right, Elise.
We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.
Yeah.
Lots of people got crucified in those times.
We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche.

Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity.
Approaching planet Omega Nine.
Warp drive disengaged.
Landing sequence initiated.
What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
I'm a Vulcan!
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
All right, hang on.
We're about to land.
Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team.
Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
No!
I'm on the away team too!
It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
I don't care!
You're not making me wait in the van again!
Fine, Kyle!
But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
Set phasers on stun.
Things seem pretty quiet.
Yes.
A little too quiet.
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C.
I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge.
Okay, fine,
I guess we'll look for
- Oh no!
Look out!
It's a giant four-headed lava frog!
Shoot it!
Oh no, it got Kyle!
No it doesn't.
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!
Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for.
No I'm not!
Goddamnit Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
Agh!
You see guys, this is why you don't bring
Jews along on the away team:
they don't play along!
Shut up about Jews, fatass!
You don't know anything!
Oh God, here we go again.
Oh yeah?
!
I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie,
Jews are the Devil!
He does not!
How do you know?
!
I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle!
You haven't seen it once!
There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do?
T hey let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
Naw uh!
Go see the movie, Kyle!
That does it!
I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion!
I'm out of here.
(Me too!
)
I'm not arguing about The Passion!
He's being an asshole!
You know what it is?
You're scared.
You're scared of the truth.
You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
People don't hate the Jews!
Really?
Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle.
The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle.
Those numbers don't lie.
If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it.
Go see it and tell me I'm wrong.
Mel Gibson, Kyle.
Mel Gibson.
...You're a stupid asshole!
Sweeet, now I can just play with myself.
Get back in the shuttlecraft!
One please.
This is an R-rated movie.
Yeah, I know, but I have to-
But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ,
I'll let you in to see it.
...Thanks.
Hac bashtud Christo.
Et lac Hesus.
Belaca veshtad.
Wa!
Haaaah!
Non.
Non.
Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!
How?
How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
Pretty brutal, isn't it?
Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?
And now, back to Terrance and Phillip.
Hey Terrance, I think I have a-
Mom!
Doorbell!
Wait, before you do, pull my thumb.
Mom!
Answer the door!
Hey Phillip, guess what?
Goddamnit, lazy-ass whore.
What?
You were right.
You were right all along.
I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but...
I didn't know,
I...
I didn't know.
It's okay, Kyle.
It's okay.
Just... say that first part again?
You were, you were right?
Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
You were right.
I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me.
You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true.
You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.
Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth.
From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone.
I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding.
Hail Mel Gibson.
Amen.
Look at that, dude.
The Passion has made almost 400 milliion dollars at the box office now.
(Goddamn.)
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie.
I guess... we have to ge see it too.
Dude.
That movie sucked.
(Yeah, it totally sucked!
)
How can they even call that a movie?
(I dunno)
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
(Yeah!
)
Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was.
Me neither.
Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on!
[
I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus.
Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing.
Hey, we want our money back.
Huh?
That movie sucked ass.
Give us back our eighteen dollars.
I can't refund your money.
You sat through the whole movie.
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
(Yeah!
)
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for YOUR SINS!
We go to church to learn that stuff!
We go to movies to be entertained!
We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
I'm now allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie!
You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.
W-what?
Mel Gibson?
You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
Yeah.
I'd like to see you try.
Oh, we will!
This is America!
And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back!
Come on, Kenny!
Kill him!
Guilty!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Die!
Kill Jesus!
Yesss!
Arrrgh!
Okay, search for Mel Gibson.
Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page.
Here we go. your source for everything Mel.
Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects.
Damnit, no phone number!
Oh wait!
"For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."
Okay, okay, wait, here we go.
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now.
Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
Nonono, no, we want our money back.
What?
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars.
Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
You thought it sucked?
Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do!
He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew.
It has made people the world over open their eyes.
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
If I knew where Mel Gibson was,
I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir.
All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu.
Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid!
I'll kick your ass!
Ohoh yeah?
!
I'd like to see you try, asshole!
I'm like six feet tall!
I don't care!
You sound like a little bitch to me!
Bitch?
!
Don't call me bitch!
I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
Yeah?
!
You wanna bring it, you little pussy?
!
I already brought it, bitch!
I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
Wait a minute.
Cartman?
!
Eup.
Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!
(Malibu?
But how?
)
We'll take the bus!
Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore.
This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!
This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
Oh, that's great, sweetie.
Tell them I'll be down shortly
Okay, hon.
Tolten sie die Juden!
Ver Kolen nichts fiersten vrieshtalan doshtiedt!
Okay, I'm ready.
I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson.

Well, what the hell does he want?
!
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
You didn't like The Passion?
But it shows how Christ suffered for you.
Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man.
Both you guys, stop!
Please.
You're gonna make people hate us more.
Can I help you?
This movie is causing anti-Semitism!
You must remove it from your theater!
That's right!
Yeah!
Remove your movie!
Remove it from the theater?
Fat chance!
We demand you stop showing it!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Nonono!
Don't become an angry mob!
The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
Juden!
What's going on here?
They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.
This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!
Nonsense!
Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man!
There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!
It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to pologize for the death of Jesus!
Well, maybe you should apologize.
That's right!
What he said.
How dare you?
!
Give me my eighteen dollars!
Mel!
Gibson!
Oh mein Savior!
Mein Führer!
You're actually here!
Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses!
We are ready to do thy bidding!
Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?
!
Hhha!
So!
You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh?
I guess now you're gonna start torturing me!
Well!
Oh, my nipples are so tender -don't squeeze them anymore!
That's...
Mel Gibson?
H-he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.
Dude, what's wrong with him?
He's kookoo, dude.
He's absolutely out of his mind.
You!
You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you?
Okay, fine.
See what you can fit in there, I can take it!
Dude!
I've been freaked out this whole time because of THAT guy's movie?
Fine!
If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!
It's our eighteen dollars!
Your movie sucked!
You can't say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked!
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed.
Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
You know, he's right, Elise.
We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.
Yeah.
Lots of people got crucified in those times.
We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche.
Woohoohoo!
Woohoohoohoohoo!

The Passion of the Jew

Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity.
Approaching planet Omega Nine.
Warp drive disengaged.
Landing sequence initiated.
What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
I'm a Vulcan!
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
All right, hang on.
We're about to land.
Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team.
Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
- No!
I'm on the away team too!
- It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
I don't care!
You're not making me wait in the van again!
Fine, Kyle!
But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
Set phasers on stun.
- Things seem pretty quiet.
- Yes.
A little too quiet.
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C.
I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge.
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for
- Oh no!
Look out!
It's a giant four-headed lava frog!
Shoot it!
Oh no, it got Kyle!
No it doesn't.
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!
Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for.
No I'm not!
Goddamnit Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
Agh!
You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
Shut up about Jews, fatass!
You don't know anything!
Oh God, here we go again.
Oh yeah?
!
I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
He does not!
How do you know?
!
I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle!
You haven't seen it once!
There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do?
They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
- Naw uh!
- Go see the movie, Kyle!
That does it!
I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion!
I'm out of here.
I'm not arguing about The Passion!
He's being an asshole!
You know what it is?
You're scared.
You're scared of the truth.
You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are,
- and why everyone hates you.
- People don't hate the Jews!
Really?
Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle.
The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle.
Those numbers don't lie.
If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it.
Go see it and tell me I'm wrong.
Mel Gibson, Kyle.
Mel Gibson.
...You're a stupid asshole!
Sweeet, now I can just play with myself.
Get back in the shuttlecraft!
One please.
This is an R-rated movie.
Yeah, I know, but I have to-
But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ,
I'll let you in to see it.
...Thanks.
How?
How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
Pretty brutal, isn't it?
Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?
"And now, back to Terrance and Phillip" Hey Terrance, I think I have a-
Mom!
Doorbell!
Mom!
Answer the door!
Goddamnit, lazy-ass whore.
You were right...
You were right all along...
I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but...
I didn't know, I...
I didn't know.
It's okay, Kyle.
It's okay.
Just... say that first part again?
You were right?
Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
You were right.
I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me.
You have shown me the way so many times in the past and...
now you are making all my dreams come true.
You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.
Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth.
From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone.
I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding.
Hail Mel Gibson.
Amen.
Look at that, dude.
The Passion has made almost 400 milliion dollars at the box office now.
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie.
I guess... we have to ge see it too.
Dude.
That movie sucked.
How can they even call that a movie?
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was.
Me neither.
Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on!
I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus.
Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing.
Hey, we want our money back.
Huh?
That movie sucked ass.
Give us back our eighteen dollars.
I can't refund your money.
You sat through the whole movie.
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for YOUR SINS!
We go to church to learn that stuff!
We go to movies to be entertained!
We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
I'm now allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie!
You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.
W- what?
Mel Gibson?
You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
Yeah.
I'd like to see you try.
Oh, we will!
This is America!
And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back!
Come on, Kenny!
- Kill him!
Guilty!
Kill him!
- Kill him!
Kill him!
Die!
Kill Jesus!
Yesss!
Okay, search for Mel Gibson.
Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page.
Here we go.
Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion. com, your source for everything Mel.
Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects.
Damnit, no phone number!
Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.. "
Okay, okay, wait, here we go.
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now.
Our first meeting is at 5:30 p. m.
Nonono, no, we want our money back
What?
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars.
Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
You thought it sucked?
Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do!
He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew.
It has made people the world over open their eyes.
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir.
All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu.
Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid!
I'll kick your ass!
Ohoh yeah?
!
I'd like to see you try, asshole!
I'm like six feet tall!
I don't care!
You sound like a little bitch to me!
Bitch?
!
Don't call me bitch!
I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
Yeah?
!
You wanna bring it, you little pussy?
!
I already brought it, bitch!
I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
Wait a minute.
Cartman?
!
Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!
We'll take the bus!
Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore.
This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!
This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
- Oh, that's great, sweetie.
- Tell them I'll be down shortly
Okay, hon.
Töten sie die Juden!
Wir können nicht stillstehen bis sie alle tot sind!
Okay, I'm ready.
I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson.
Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?
No.
Actually, we're guests as well.
I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise.
Hello.
I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.
Oh I agree.
There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion.
It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.
And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.
Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?
Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!
It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives.
Ah hello everyone.
Achtung.
My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.
Ah thank you, thank you.
I'm happy to see that all of you. were affected by The Passion like I was.
Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
We sure do.
But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.
- Wha, what does that mean, sweetie?
- I'm not sure, but-uh.
Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together.
The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Now, in order to do what we all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support.
I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
Oh, what a great idea!
We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!
Heheh great!
Yeah!
Great idea.
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
- We sure do!
- Yeah.
All right.
Woohoo!
Thank you.
This must be the place.
Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded.
Yes?
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
You can't not like The Passion!
I just followed the Bible!
Christ died for you.
Go home.
Look, dude, we came a long way.
We're not leaving until you give us our money.
Oh yeah?
Well you're gonna have to find it first.
But I won't tell you where I keep my money.
You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!
Tor-torture you?
Ha!
So you DO intend to torture me, huh?
!
Well go ahead!
Do your worst!
You STILL won't get your ticket money back!
I can take whatever you can dish out!
We don't want to torture you.
I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?
!
Well go ahead!
I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
I have to use that money to build my church!
I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church!
And do you know why?
!
So I can play banjo!
Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!
Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!
How dare you call me crazy!
This means war!
And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins.
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
...What is troubling you, my child?
Well, I have this friend, see?
And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel.
And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
Ah!
You mean he's a Jew!
Right.
But he can't live with the guilt anymore.
Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy.
And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie.
I I can't sleep at night.
I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
Yes, The Passion is very powerful.
The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion.
The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.
But how can the Jews make it better?
Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus.
Remember:
Christianity is about... atonement.
Wait.
That's it.
Atonement.
Of course.
I know what I have to do now.
Thank you, Father.
Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker
You wanna get outta here?
Talk to me.
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!
Wait!
There's his wallet!
Freedom!
Jesus is Lord!
All right, let's get the hell out of here!
When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!
Run, dude, run!
And good evening, friends!
One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters.
And now, we proud few gathere here as a people brought together by its message!
Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!
Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
- What a great idea!
- It'll be like a parade!
Good idea!
And as we march for The Pasion we should also voice our support!
So, when I say "Es ist Zeit f?
r Säuberung,"
you all chant back "Wir m?
ssen die Juden ausrotten. "
Well, what does that mean, dear?
Oh, I think it's Aramaic.
You know, like in the movie.
Ooo, Aramaic.
Cool.
What was our Aramaic line again?
Wir m?
ssen die Juden ausrotten!
Wir m?
ssen die Juden ausrotten.
Es ist Zeit f?
r Rache!
Wir m?
ssen die Juden ausrotten.
Oh huh, this is fun!
All right, everyone!
Forward, march!
Es ist Zeit f?
r Rache!
Wir m?
ssen die Juden ausrotten.
- Es ist Zeit f?
r Rache!
- Wir m?
ssen die Juden ausrotten.
Nice.
Shalom hak nak shalom.
And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congragation.
Thank you, rabbi.
In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery.
In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust.
And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apolo for the death of Jesus.
What?
Whatwhatwhaaat?
!
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
Oh my God!
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?
!
- I saw The Passion.
- Oh no!
The Passion?
!
This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having!
- Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.
- Stereotyping Jews is terrible.
Something must be done to stop that movie!
Now, now, everyone calm down.
We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie.
There's no cause for alarm.
- Wir m?
ssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit f?
r Rache!
- Wir m?
ssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit f?
r Rache!
- Wir m?
ssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit f?
r Rache!
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty...
seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.
But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
Oh, you've got to be shittin' me.
Give me back my money!
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.
Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
Huh?
Mel Gibson is chafter us.
You've gotta go faster.
Haha, very funny, kid.
Sit down and stop playing games.
I'm not playing games.
Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna-
What the hell?
- Hey!
That's Mel Gibson!
- Yeah.
I told you that!
Well, what the hell does he want?
!
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
You didn't like The Passion?
But it shows how Christ suffered for you.
Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man.
You guys, stop!
Please.
You're gonna make people hate us more.
Can I help you?
This movie is causing anti-Semitism!
You must remove it from your theater!
That's right!
Yeah!
Remove your movie!
Remove it from the theater?
Fat chance!
- We demand you stop showing it!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Nonono!
Don't become an angry mob!
The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
Juden!
- What's going on here?
- They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.
This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!
Nonsense!

There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!
It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!
Well, maybe you should apologize.
- That's right!
What he said.
- How dare you?

Give me my eighteen dollars!

H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I hadpictured.

Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."
Okay, okay, wait, here we go.
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now.
Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
Nonono, no, we want our money back
What?
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars.
Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
You thought it sucked?
Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do!
He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew.
It has made people the world over open their eyes.
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir.
All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu.
Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid!
I'll kick your ass!
Ohoh yeah?
!
I'd like to see you try, asshole!
I'm like six feet tall!
I don't care!
You sound like a little bitch to me!
Bitch?
!
Don't call me bitch!
I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
Yeah?
!
You wanna bring it, you little pussy?
!
I already brought it, bitch!
I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
Wait a minute.
Cartman?
!
Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!
We'll take the bus!
Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore.
This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!
This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
- Oh, that's great, sweetie.
- Tell them I'll be down shortly
Okay, hon.
Töten sie die Juden!
Wir können nicht stillstehen bis sie alle tot sind!
Okay, I'm ready.
I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson.
Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?
No.
Actually, we're guests as well.
I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise.
Hello.
I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.
Oh I agree.
There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion.
It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.
And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.
Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?
Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!
It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives.
Ah hello everyone.
Achtung.
My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.
Ah thank you, thank you.
I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was.
Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
We sure do.
But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.
- Wha, what does that mean, sweetie?
- I'm not sure, but-uh.
Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together.
The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Now, in order to do what we all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support.
I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
Oh, what a great idea!
We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!
Heheh great!
Yeah!
Great idea.
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
- We sure do!
- Yeah.
All right.
Woohoo!
Thank you.
This must be the place.
Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded.
Yes?
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
You can't not like The Passion!
I just followed the Bible!
Christ died for you.
Go home.
Look, dude, we came a long way.
We're not leaving until you give us our money.
Oh yeah?
Well you're gonna have to find it first.
But I won't tell you where I keep my money.
You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!
Tor-torture you?
Ha!
So you DO intend to torture me, huh?
!
Well go ahead!
Do your worst!
You STILL won't get your ticket money back!
I can take whatever you can dish out!
We don't want to torture you.
I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?
!
Well go ahead!
I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
I have to use that money to build my church!
I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church!
And do you know why?
!
So I can play banjo!
Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!
Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!
How dare you call me crazy!
This means war!
And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins.
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
...What is troubling you, my child?
Well, I have this friend, see?
And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel.
And it ...so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
Ah!
You mean he's a Jew!
Right.
But he can't live with the guilt anymore.
Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy.
And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie.
I I can't sleep at night.
I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
Yes, The Passion is very powerful.
The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion.
The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.
But how can the Jews make it better?
Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus.
Remember:
Christianity is about... atonement.
Wait.
That's it.
Atonement.
Of course.
I know what I have to do now.
Thank you, Father.
Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker
You wanna get outta here?
Talk to me.
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!
Wait!
There's his wallet!
Freedom!
Jesus is Lord!
All right, let's get the hell out of here!
When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!
Run, dude, run!
And good evening, friends!
One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters.
And now, we proud few gathere here as a people brought together by its message!
Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!
Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
- What a great idea!
- It'll be like a parade!
Good idea!
And as we march for The Pasion we should also voice our support!
So, when I say "Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"
you all chant back "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."
Well, what does that mean, dear?
Oh, I think it's Aramaic.
You know, like in the movie.
Ooo, Aramaic.
Cool.
What was our Aramaic line again?
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Oh huh, this is fun!
All right, everyone!
Forward, march!
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
- Es ist Zeit für Rache!
- Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Nice.
Shalom hak nak shalom.
And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congragation.
Thank you, rabbi.
In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery.
In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust.
And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
What?
Whatwhatwhaaat?
!
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
Oh my God!
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?
!
- I saw The Passion.
- Oh no!
The Passion?
!
This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having!
- Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.
- Stereotyping Jews is terrible.
Something must be done to stop that movie!
Now, now, everyone calm down.
We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie.
There's no cause for alarm.
- Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit für Rache!
- Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit für Rache!
- Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
- Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty...
seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.
But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
Oh, you've got to be shittin' me.
Give me back my money!
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.
Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
Huh?
Mel Gibson is chasing after us.
You've gotta go faster.
Haha, very funny, kid.
Sit down and stop playing games.
I'm not playing games.
Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna-
What the hell?
- Hey!
That's Mel Gibson!
- Yeah.
I told you that!
Well, what the hell does he want?
!
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
You didn't like The Passion?
But it shows how Christ suffered for you.
Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man.
You guys, stop!
Please.
You're gonna make people hate us more.
Can I help you?
This movie is causing anti-Semitism!
You must remove it from your theater!
That's right!
Yeah!
Remove your movie!
Remove it from the theater?
Fat chance!
- We demand you stop showing it!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Nonono!
Don't become an angry mob!
The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
Juden!
- What's going on here?
- They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.
This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!
Nonsense!
Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man!
There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!
It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!
Well, maybe you should apologize.
- That's right!
What he said.
- How dare you?
!
Look out!
Give me my eighteen dollars!
Mel!
Gibson!
Oh mein Savior!
Mein Führer!
You're actually here!
Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses!
We are ready to do thy bidding!
Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?
!
So!
You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh?
I guess now you're gonna start torturing me!
Well!
Oh, my nipples are so tender!
Ddon't squeeze them anymore!
That's...
Mel Gibson?
H-he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.
Well.
I guess you wanna torture me now, don't you?
!
Dude, what's wrong with him?
He's kookoo, dude.
He's absolutely out of his mind.
You!
You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you?
Okay, fine.
See what you can fit in there, I can take it!
Dude!
I've been freaked out this whole time because of THAT guy's movie?
Fine!
If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!
It's our eighteen dollars!
Your movie sucked!
You can't say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked!
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed.
Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
You know, he's right, Elise.
We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.
Yeah.
Lots of people got crucified in those times.
We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche.
These things have booby traps.
Booby.
Will do.
And it's a good thing I have my trusty penknife.
Dean, those are nail clippers.
Got it!
It's treasure!
Brownish chunks of pirate booty!
Hank, that's an old piece of candy.
Booty!
And there's a little guy in there made out of pipe-cleaners.
Aw, cool.
I get that!
It's all macaroni and empty spools and puffy paint, some yarn...
Felt scraps.
Hey!
Packages of googly-eyes!
I'm totally taking these.
Hey, this is interesting.
It's in Sanskrit.
And a dialect I'm not familiar with.
I'm not sure I can read it.
Well, just try.
"It... we have to you likely the opening now of this chest.
"To all that protect mine rainy-day craft box... are cursed, when to not take away...
"things or objects..." or something like that.
The prepositions and stuff are all screwy...
It's a cursed treasure!
The boys are in trouble.
You have thieved from the sacred craft-bin of Olee Janeema.
Give him back the googly-eyes!
- You!
- I didn't take 'em!
Now your blood shall flow in his name...
My arm came off.
I can't believe that happened!
Out of the way, boys.
I'm gonna give him something to really cry about.
Aw, I wanted a piece of him.
Stop!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Stop hitting yourself!
Ooh, the terrible hurting!
Ow!
Please stop doing that.
Enough!
The Monarch!
While you were wasting your time castrating a priceless antique...
I have been systematically feeding babies... to hungry, mutated puppies!
Not likely, Monarch.
Silence!
You know what this means.
Mecha-shiva.
Mecha-shiva go!
Oh, no!
Wait a minute!
That's insane!
They're total liars!
I kept my mouth shut when Dean said he could read Sanskrit.
Then, when Hank said he wanted a piece of him...
I was, like, fine.
Whatever.
But Mecha-shiva?
No way!
They are so lying.
I'm innocent.
And now, Mr. Monarch, you'll have your chance.
Order!
Order!
I will have order!
Mecha-shiva!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Would this be the courtroom... where one might attend "The People v. The Monarch"?
You got the right room, but no one goes through these doors without clearance.
I'm sure you'll find that I have every right to attend these proceedings.
I'm in, and I've made a bit of a mess.
Send a cleaner for 375 pounds.
Maybe more.
- So, Hank... it is Hank, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
Well, Hank, what's it like to be a...
liar?
Do you like being a liar, with pants constantly on fire?
Objection, your honor!
Leading.
I'll rephrase that.
Hank, are you a liar?
No, sir.
I don't think so.
- Yes, you are!
- You're the liar!
And may I remind you that I am rubber and you are glue... and whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you!
That's it!
This court will recess for one hour.
I want to see the attorneys in my chamber now!
You're on thin ice here, but do you get off the ice?
Hell, no!
You jump up and down like a lunatic having a conniption fit.
Now, if it was up to me, you'd have been in chains an hour ago.
But this is a trial by jury, and it's up to your peers...
Peers?
Peers!
How dare you!
That repulsive display of humanity out there?
No way!
Oh, look, freak-show decided to show up.
Would you be so kind as to liberate me from my fetters?
It is a powerful hot in here.
Your Honor, I have some experience... with these what you might call super villain-types.
They're a specialty of mine.
What with this condition I'm sorely afflicted with.
What?
You have a condition?
No.
No way.
Most of them are wilder than a peach orchard hog.
But this one here will go down like all the others.
Yessir, that's a promise.
I'm gonna be working harder than a cat trying to bury a turd on a marble floor.
Now, that's appealing.
I don't even have to open it.
I can just tell... egg salad.
Fart-sandwiches.
Dean, hold your breath.
We're going in for the cookie.
T-minus three, two, one.
If I knew you could just call the cops on him...
I would have done it years ago!
Because I'm no sissy.
No, sir.
I would just pick up that phone and, "Officer, there's a man in a butterfly suit...
"shooting my robot with a laser beam."
We'd still be waiting for the cops to show up.
The police stay out of the way of the Guild for the most part.
Who do you think supplied the department with new cruisers last year?
My tax dollars, for one.
Santa Claus, for two.
Keep dreamin'.
No cop would respond to a call like that.
What about a supercop with a jet pack and a devil-may-care attitude?
The only way the police would get involved is... if the Guild screwed with them first.
So when the Monarch messed with the police...
- he messed with...
- The Guild.
I was gonna say that.
Sovereign...
Many of our operatives are in place.
We await your orders.
Good.
Good.
Let us proceed to stage five.
It shall be done.
Great, way to make me look like a tool!
What are you doing back there?
Have you seen my juice-box?
Oh, that was yours?
- I thought that...
- Great.
Thanks.
Why did I even bother putting my initials on it?
How rude of me.
Would you care for some Pez?
Oh... no.
I think they taste too much like soap.
For my next witness, I would like to call to the stand...
The Monarch!
They are so gonna fry this idiot.
Just get on the stand and give your testimony.
Oh.
OK.
Right.
Sorry.
How do I, uh?
Oh, any time, Mr. Monarch.
Today would be nice.
OK, I should just go then?
Please!
This all started soon after "The Flight of the Monarch" was published... a mean little tell-all book filled with nothing but lies and pictures of also-lies.
- What the hell is this?
- A book?
No!
But you would think it was, right?
You can read it like a book.
Here, I'll show you.
"Rifling through his pockets for change, the Monarch accidentally launches...
"a sodium-pentothal-tipped dart deep into his own thigh.
"Upon hearing a girlish symphony of shrill walls...
"a waitress comes to his aid..."
I told you.
You told me he wouldn't find out.
You're such a dick.
You put his face on the cover!
"...plucking your eyebrows?
!"
Oh, it's almost exactly like a book.
There's even some pictures.
Why, here's one of me at Dance-eteria... making out with Stiv Bators and Lydia Lunch!
But this is not a book.
This is a suicide note!
Good news!
The euthanasia will be carried out by me.
The author has twenty minutes to seek my aid before I just kill all of you.
You'll find me in my room... crying.
After a heart-to-heart with my family of friends... a confession soon followed.
It must have been hard for him to come to a man he saw as a mentor... and confess to penning such libelous slander.
I was lenient on him.
He punished himself enough.
You should have replaced his blood with acid after this part.
The sharks won't touch him now.
Thanks, Dr. Girlfriend.
Now you tell me.
Lower the giant hair dryer!
Objection!
On what grounds?
Boring me to tears.
Ha!
Relevance, Your Honor.
Mr. Monarch hasn't been charged with having a book written about him.
He's been charged with the abduction or maybe, well... disintegration of a police officer.
I'm getting to that!
Just keep your pants on.
Oh, wait.
You can't wear pants, can you?
Overruled.
Continue, Mr. Monarch.
But please get to the point.
But sadly, the repercussions of "The Flight of the Monarch"... were far from over.
OK, then who haven't you slept with?
I'm sure that's a shorter list.
Oh, you are insane!
I'm insane?
I'm insane?
Look at these!
There's a picture of you in Monstroso's lap.
That was a party.
Look at his lap... it's huge.
There's, like, five of us on it.
Yeah, right.
And here's one of you skinny dipping with Jim Foetus!
Let me see that.
I don't remember...
And there's a whole collage of you and Phantom Limb.
All right, fine!
I used to work for him.
So what?
Holy crap!
Look at your costume!
What, did Frank Frazetta design it for you?
It's tiny!
I can see your dirty pillows!
I am leaving!
If you can't calm down, I'm leaving.
You can't leave.
I'm throwing you out.
Get out of my cocoon, you whore!
After an amicable parting of the ways, life went on as usual.
And that was the last time I saw Dr. Girl...
Dr. Ex-Girlfriend!
Good riddance to bad girlfriends, I say.
My guess is about then, well, she was so sad about her failure to upset me... that she probably went crazy, rampage nuts.
He's lying!
Oh, no way.
That's a real big surprise.
Good gracious.
What happened to you?
It's a long story.
Can I come in?
Of course, of course.
It's horrid out there.
I insist on it.
Dear girl, you're soaked to the bone.
Come sit down and tell me all about it.
Now, let it all out.
I'm just going to get you some dry clothes.
He threw me out.
After saying the most horrible things, he threw me out.
The cad!
How dare he!
Who does he think he is...
Mr. King Butterfly Man?
Well, I'm nobody's doormat.
Before I met him, I was Lady Au Pair.
I was feared, and I was respected, and not just by my murderous moppets... by everyone.
And after that, I was...
Queen Etherea.
Put it on.
I want to see you in it again.
Oh, I can't believe you saved it.
What are these hard chunks?
My tears.
Tears?
You have to be kidding me!
You know that sick, deformed slob... you know he was pounding his invisible meat...
That's it.
Objection!
Your honor, I have children listening to this potty talk!
Sustained.
I want that last bit stricken from the record... and my mind.
Dr. Venture, you might want to take your sons out.
Not me!
There's no way I'm gonna miss this.
Brock, be a lamb, and take the boys somewhere.
Aw, come on, Pop.
We're not babies.
Dean told me how he pounds his...
All right.
Yeah, boys.
Uh, hey, why don't we go scrounge up some adventure... do some, uh...
Control, delay order.
We've lost full containment.
I repeat, delay order.
Copy on delay.
- We are on standby.
- Knew it.
I thought you went to the can.
I did.
I'm back.
That was, like, ten seconds ago.
What, are you pissing in the corner?
There's gum in this fountain...
our first clue.
It seems our thirsty mystery man was a gum-chewer.
Look, Brock.
Hank found a clue.
Oh, great.
Boys, don't touch that clue.
That clue was in somebody's mouth.
That clue's filthy.
Now, take your time.
I know this is very upsetting for you.
Would you like a tissue?
It's fine.
I have one.
If this is too much for you...
No, please.
I want to finish.
Go on, then.
I was there for maybe a half an hour.
We were eating some aged...
something-or-other cheese.
I don't recall what it was.
Asiago.
I developed a love for this playful provision... during my stay in Florence, Italy.
It's really nothing more than a common table cheese... but I find it a charming yang to merlot's impish ying.
It tastes like the inside of an old thermos.
Will you knock that off?
Let me get that.
You must be strong.
Remember who you are.
His lies can't hurt you anymore.
Stop that.
We heard you the first time.
I knew you were here!
The henchmen were all, "She went to her mother's"... but I knew you went crawling back to him!
Keep your voice down.
Holy crap!
What are you wearing?
Is that your Queen Etherea suit?
You're wearing your old costume now?
My clothes were wet, and he...
I can't believe you're falling for that floating... smooth-talking jackass!
I can't even look at you in that... slut... slut slutty slut suit!
I was wearing this when you first met me.
I don't remember you complaining then.
That's because I had you out of that rag... within the first five minutes of meeting you.
I made you the Monarch's!
You are a monster!
All right.
That was supposed to be romantic.
Oh, go to hell!
Fine!
Then he just hung around the yard yelling till somebody called the cops.
That was all you saw?
Well, I saw the flashing lights from, I guess, the police... and I heard some talking.
Then...
- Then?
- Then... nothing.
Ow!
What the dealy-o?
Saliva is nature's glue.
And raisins are nature's candy!
It's the oldest trick in the book.
If I place a hair between the door and frame...
- We've been made.
- It works as a burglar alarm.
All we have to do is come back, and if the hair is gone... somebody used this door.
Help!
Do not be too hasty entering that room.
I had Taco Bell for lunch!
Expert witness Dr. Byron Orpheus has arrived!
The hair's gone!
A clue!
It was Dr. O. The whole time.
I wonder what that means.
It means Dr. Orpheus had to take a dump.
So, nice job.
Case closed.
Place your right hand on the...
How sweet.
A Bible.
Well, if you don't mind, sir, I have a book of my own for this little ritual.
Keep your fingers clear of its mouth.
He's a nibbler.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... and nothing but the truth, so help you... uh, whoever?
I swear it.
Dr. Orpheus, could you tell the court what it is that you do?
You're a type of magician?
Oh, they have no idea what they're in for.
Well, if you must call me that, yes.
But if you are after mere parlor tricks... you will be sorely disappointed.
For if I reach behind your ear, it will not be a nickel I pull out... but your very soul!
Good night, ladies and gentlemen.
You've been a great crowd.
A mind reader, huh?
That seems kind of hocus-pocus, now, don't it?
It's as crazy as... oh, let's say the fact... that nobody can recall what happened that night... the night that a policeman and his motorcycle simply vanished.
Well, maybe I'm just an ignorant old country lawyer... but this sounds like a cover-up.
Or is it magic?
Do you believe in magic?
The Monarch must, for he's given us no other rational explanation.
Something big is going down.
This place is crawling with Strangers.
You can't expect to know everybody.
No, Hank.
Strangers are undercover Guild operatives.
We gotta warn Pop!
No, Dean.
This is Guild business.
Your father isn't in any harm.
The Guild works clean, professional.
It's surgical with them.
In a way, they're the only organization I still respect.
And they kill clean.
Don't let dames get in the way.
Honestly, Hank, where do you pick that stuff up?
I never see you read.
It's weird, right?
It's like he channels dead crazy people.
You think it's a cry for help?
So... a mind reader.
Fascinating.
Could you read the mind of, let's say, for instance, the Monarch?
If it would please the court.
Objection.
No way!
This is most unorthodox.
Unorthodox?
The defendant's in a crown, for God's sake!
I myself am growing from the torso of an inbred simpleton.
I promise not to make his eyes boil.
I'll... allow it.
Hug me.
Fine.
Whatever gets you off, man.
Just don't go for the reach-around... because the Monarch doesn't swing that...
Sleep!
Dream.
All right, what's going on here?
Oh, just doing some... gardening.
I got a call from a concerned citizen there's a domestic going on here.
Listen, Officer Poncharello, my second-in-command just left me.
So why don't you put your fat Tom-of-Finland ass... back on your big gay bike and go home?
This is none of your beeswax.
OK, pal, let's just keep those hands where I can see them.
Oh, you want some of this?
Let's go, Fonzie.
Come on.
Take your best shot!
Think you can take this?
So, too fast for you?
It's all there.
Do you want to count it?
No.
That's bad form.
There's a passport, name change information, the works.
Even got you a new wife.
You won't see her much, being a supermodel.
She'll be traveling a lot.
Uh, do I have an erection?
I feel like I might have one.
Pleasure doing business with you, gentlemen.
If we see you, hear your voice in a crowd...
Don't worry about me.
I'm a ghost.
Good.
We'll take it from here.
You won't believe this.
I've seen the greasy interior of many a mind... and I'm not sure I believe this.
Now!
It must be now!
Now!
- What'd I miss?
- Now!
It's a Freeze-Team!
Down on the ground and hold your breath.
There's pee pee on the floor!
I told you to hold your breath.
Take the prisoner.
For everyone else, I want a level three memory wipe.
Move!
Finally, number three on the Guild's most wanted list...
Tiny Attorney.
It's time the Guild sentences him to a "Trial Separation."
Ha!
I just made that up.
It's funny on a lot of levels.
Right.
It just came out.
What about the necromancer?
Memory wipes don't work on his kind.
True, but they take to hypnotic suggestion like cancer to a prostate.
Wait!
I know this one.
Filed with us five times to get an arch-rival... part of the Venture clique, I think.
You know the Monarch did it.
He's a very bad man who wants to hurt the Venture family... and once he's put away... we'll get all of you a new arch-rival, just like you've always wanted.
You're gonna put the Monarch away?
You never told me that.
Somebody has to take the fall.
But you, my dear, you were perfect, a regular Mata Hari.
Trust me.
The Guild will reward you handsomely.
But as for your precious Monarch, forget him.
He's totally screwed.
Will that hypnotic suggestion thing work on him?
I think so.
I had nothing to do with this crap.
It was, like, I don't know, those weird kids, the Venture brothers.
They did it.
Strangers, withdraw!
All clear, Mr. Samson.
The Guild appreciates your non-interference.
Whatever.
How much time?
Twenty seconds.
Continue, Mr. Orpheus.
You were saying?
I hope they find me a girl villain.
- Mr. Orpheus?
- A redhead.
He's gonna blow it.
Brock, when did you get back?
What happened to the little guy riding the retard?
Don't worry about it.
Mr. Orpheus, you were telling us what you learned.
That is true, I was.
With my own eyes, I have seen into his senses.
I have been a witness to his doings!
And I have found that the Monarch is... without any shadow of a doubt... guilty!
Oh, my precious pookums, of course I forgive you.
Why, in a few, oh, I don't know, decades...
I'll be out of here,
And we can... we can just start again.
Can I go now?
Everybody's staring at me.
That's good soup!
Now, be careful.
These things have booby traps.
Booby.
Will do.
And it's a good thing I have my trusty penknife.
Dean, those are nail clippers.
Got it!
It's treasure!
Brownish chunks of pirate booty!
Hank, that's an old piece of candy.
Booty!
And there's a little guy in there made out of pipe-cleaners.
Aw, cool.
I get that!
It's all macaroni and empty spools and puffy paint, some yarn...
Felt scraps.
Hey!
Packages of googly-eyes!
I'm totally taking these.
Hey, this is interesting.
It's in Sanskrit.
And a dialect I'm not familiar with.
I'm not sure I can read it.
Well, just try.
"It... we have to you likely the opening now of this chest.
"To all that protect mine rainy-day craft box... are cursed, when to not take away...
"things or objects..." or something like that.
The prepositions and stuff are all screwy...
It's a cursed treasure!
The boys are in trouble.
You have thieved from the sacred craft-bin of Olee Janeema.
Give him back the googly-eyes!
- You!
- I didn't take 'em!
Now your blood shall flow in his name...
My arm came off.
I can't believe that happened!
Out of the way, boys.
I'm gonna give him something to really cry about.
Aw, I wanted a piece of him.
Stop!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Stop hitting yourself!
Ooh, the terrible hurting!
Ow!
Please stop doing that.
Enough!
The Monarch!
While you were wasting your time castrating a priceless antique...
I have been systematically feeding babies... to hungry, mutated puppies!
Not likely, Monarch.
Silence!
You know what this means.
Mecha-shiva.
Mecha-shiva go!
Oh, no!
Wait a minute!
That's insane!
They're total liars!
I kept my mouth shut when Dean said he could read Sanskrit.
Then, when Hank said he wanted a piece of him...
I was, like, fine.
Whatever.
But Mecha-shiva?
No way!
They are so lying.
I'm innocent.
And now, Mr. Monarch, you'll have your chance.
Order!
Order!
I will have order!
Mecha-shiva!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Would this be the courtroom... where one might attend "The People v. The Monarch"?
You got the right room, but no one goes through these doors without clearance.
I'm sure you'll find that I have every right to attend these proceedings.
I'm in, and I've made a bit of a mess.
Send a cleaner for 375 pounds.
Maybe more.
- So, Hank... it is Hank, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
Well, Hank, what's it like to be a...
liar?
Do you like being a liar, with pants constantly on fire?
Objection, your honor!
Leading.
I'll rephrase that.
Hank, are you a liar?
No, sir.
I don't think so.
- Yes, you are!
- You're the liar!
And may I remind you that I am rubber and you are glue... and whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you!
That's it!
This court will recess for one hour.
I want to see the attorneys in my chamber now!
You're on thin ice here, but do you get off the ice?
Hell, no!
You jump up and down like a lunatic having a conniption fit.
Now, if it was up to me, you'd have been in chains an hour ago.
But this is a trial by jury, and it's up to your peers...
Peers?
Peers!
How dare you!
That repulsive display of humanity out there?
No way!
Oh, look, freak-show decided to show up.
Would you be so kind as to liberate me from my fetters?
It is a powerful hot in here.
Your Honor, I have some experience... with these what you might call super villain-types.
They're a specialty of mine.
What with this condition I'm sorely afflicted with.
What?
You have a condition?
No.
No way.
Most of them are wilder than a peach orchard hog.
But this one here will go down like all the others.
Yessir, that's a promise.
I'm gonna be working harder than a cat trying to bury a turd on a marble floor.
Now, that's appealing.
I don't even have to open it.
I can just tell... egg salad.
Fart-sandwiches.
Dean, hold your breath.
We're going in for the cookie.
T-minus three, two, one.
If I knew you could just call the cops on him...
I would have done it years ago!
Because I'm no sissy.
No, sir.
I would just pick up that phone and, "Officer, there's a man in a butterfly suit...
"shooting my robot with a laser beam."
We'd still be waiting for the cops to show up.
The police stay out of the way of the Guild for the most part.
Who do you think supplied the department with new cruisers last year?
My tax dollars, for one.
Santa Claus, for two.
Keep dreamin'.
No cop would respond to a call like that.
What about a supercop with a jet pack and a devil-may-care attitude?
The only way the police would get involved is... if the Guild screwed with them first.
So when the Monarch messed with the police...
- he messed with...
- The Guild.
I was gonna say that.
Sovereign...
Many of our operatives are in place.
We await your orders.
Good.
Good.
Let us proceed to stage five.
It shall be done.
Great, way to make me look like a tool!
What are you doing back there?
Have you seen my juice-box?
Oh, that was yours?
- I thought that...
- Great.
Thanks.
Why did I even bother putting my initials on it?
How rude of me.
Would you care for some Pez?
Oh... no.
I think they taste too much like soap.
For my next witness, I would like to call to the stand...
The Monarch!
They are so gonna fry this idiot.
Just get on the stand and give your testimony.
Oh.
OK.
Right.
Sorry.
How do I, uh?
Oh, any time, Mr. Monarch.
Today would be nice.
OK, I should just go then?
Please!
This all started soon after "The Flight of the Monarch" was published... a mean little tell-all book filled with nothing but lies and pictures of also-lies.
- What the hell is this?
- A book?
No!
But you would think it was, right?
You can read it like a book.
Here, I'll show you.
"Rifling through his pockets for change, the Monarch accidentally launches...
"a sodium-pentothal-tipped dart deep into his own thigh.
"Upon hearing a girlish symphony of shrill walls...
"a waitress comes to his aid..."
I told you.
You told me he wouldn't find out.
You're such a dick.
You put his face on the cover!
"...plucking your eyebrows?
!"
Oh, it's almost exactly like a book.
There's even some pictures.
Why, here's one of me at Dance-eteria... making out with Stiv Bators and Lydia Lunch!
But this is not a book.
This is a suicide note!
Good news!
The euthanasia will be carried out by me.
The author has twenty minutes to seek my aid before I just kill all of you.
You'll find me in my room... crying.
After a heart-to-heart with my family of friends... a confession soon followed.
It must have been hard for him to come to a man he saw as a mentor... and confess to penning such libelous slander.
I was lenient on him.
He punished himself enough.
You should have replaced his blood with acid after this part.
The sharks won't touch him now.
Thanks, Dr. Girlfriend.
Now you tell me.
Lower the giant hair dryer!
Objection!
On what grounds?
Boring me to tears.
Ha!
Relevance, Your Honor.
Mr. Monarch hasn't been charged with having a book written about him.
He's been charged with the abduction or maybe, well... disintegration of a police officer.
I'm getting to that!
Just keep your pants on.
Oh, wait.
You can't wear pants, can you?
Overruled.
Continue, Mr. Monarch.
But please get to the point.
But sadly, the repercussions of "The Flight of the Monarch"... were far from over.
OK, then who haven't you slept with?
I'm sure that's a shorter list.
Oh, you are insane!
I'm insane?
I'm insane?
Look at these!
There's a picture of you in Monstroso's lap.
That was a party.
Look at his lap... it's huge.
There's, like, five of us on it.
Yeah, right.
And here's one of you skinny dipping with Jim Foetus!
Let me see that.
I don't remember...
And there's a whole collage of you and Phantom Limb.
All right, fine!
I used to work for him.
So what?
Holy crap!
Look at your costume!
What, did Frank Frazetta design it for you?
It's tiny!
I can see your dirty pillows!
I am leaving!
If you can't calm down, I'm leaving.
You can't leave.
I'm throwing you out.
Get out of my cocoon, you whore!
After an amicable parting of the ways, life went on as usual.
And that was the last time I saw Dr. Girl...
Dr. Ex-Girlfriend!
Good riddance to bad girlfriends, I say.
My guess is about then, well, she was so sad about her failure to upset me... that she probably went crazy, rampage nuts.
He's lying!
Oh, no way.
That's a real big surprise.
Good gracious.
What happened to you?
It's a long story.
Can I come in?
Of course, of course.
It's horrid out there.
I insist on it.
Dear girl, you're soaked to the bone.
Come sit down and tell me all about it.
Now, let it all out.
I'm just going to get you some dry clothes.
He threw me out.
After saying the most horrible things, he threw me out.
The cad!
How dare he!
Who does he think he is...
Mr. King Butterfly Man?
Well, I'm nobody's doormat.
Before I met him, I was Lady Au Pair.
I was feared, and I was respected, and not just by my murderous moppets... by everyone.
And after that, I was...
Queen Etherea.
Put it on.
I want to see you in it again.
Oh, I can't believe you saved it.
What are these hard chunks?
My tears.
Tears?
You have to be kidding me!
You know that sick, deformed slob... you know he was pounding his invisible meat...
That's it.
Objection!
Your honor, I have children listening to this potty talk!
Sustained.
I want that last bit stricken from the record... and my mind.
Dr. Venture, you might want to take your sons out.
Not me!
There's no way I'm gonna miss this.
Brock, be a lamb, and take the boys somewhere.
Aw, come on, Pop.
We're not babies.
Dean told me how he pounds his...
All right.
Yeah, boys.
Uh, hey, why don't we go scrounge up some adventure... do some, uh...
Control, delay order.
We've lost full containment.
I repeat, delay order.
Copy on delay.
- We are on standby.
- Knew it.
I thought you went to the can.
I did.
I'm back.
That was, like, ten seconds ago.
What, are you pissing in the corner?
There's gum in this fountain...
our first clue.
It seems our thirsty mystery man was a gum-chewer.
Look, Brock.
Hank found a clue.
Oh, great.
Boys, don't touch that clue.
That clue was in somebody's mouth.
That clue's filthy.
Now, take your time.
I know this is very upsetting for you.
Would you like a tissue?
It's fine.
I have one.
If this is too much for you...
No, please.
I want to finish.
Go on, then.
I was there for maybe a half an hour.
We were eating some aged...
something-or-other cheese.
I don't recall what it was.
Asiago.
I developed a love for this playful provision... during my stay in Florence, Italy.
It's really nothing more than a common table cheese... but I find it a charming yang to merlot's impish ying.
It tastes like the inside of an old thermos.
Will you knock that off?
Let me get that.
You must be strong.
Remember who you are.
His lies can't hurt you anymore.
Stop that.
We heard you the first time.
I knew you were here!
The henchmen were all, "She went to her mother's"... but I knew you went crawling back to him!
Keep your voice down.
Holy crap!
What are you wearing?
Is that your Queen Etherea suit?
You're wearing your old costume now?
My clothes were wet, and he...
I can't believe you're falling for that floating... smooth-talking jackass!
I can't even look at you in that... slut... slut slutty slut suit!
I was wearing this when you first met me.
I don't remember you complaining then.
That's because I had you out of that rag... within the first five minutes of meeting you.
I made you the Monarch's!
You are a monster!
All right.
That was supposed to be romantic.
Oh, go to hell!
Fine!
Then he just hung around the yard yelling till somebody called the cops.
That was all you saw?
Well, I saw the flashing lights from, I guess, the police... and I heard some talking.
Then...
- Then?
- Then... nothing.
Ow!
What the dealy-o?
Saliva is nature's glue.
And raisins are nature's candy!
It's the oldest trick in the book.
If I place a hair between the door and frame...
- We've been made.
- It works as a burglar alarm.
All we have to do is come back, and if the hair is gone... somebody used this door.
Help!
Do not be too hasty entering that room.
I had Taco Bell for lunch!
Expert witness Dr. Byron Orpheus has arrived!
The hair's gone!
A clue!
It was Dr. O. The whole time.
I wonder what that means.
It means Dr. Orpheus had to take a dump.
So, nice job.
Case closed.
Place your right hand on the...
How sweet.
A Bible.
Well, if you don't mind, sir, I have a book of my own for this little ritual.
Keep your fingers clear of its mouth.
He's a nibbler.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... and nothing but the truth, so help you... uh, whoever?
I swear it.
Dr. Orpheus, could you tell the court what it is that you do?
You're a type of magician?
Oh, they have no idea what they're in for.
Well, if you must call me that, yes.
But if you are after mere parlor tricks... you will be sorely disappointed.
For if I reach behind your ear, it will not be a nickel I pull out... but your very soul!
Good night, ladies and gentlemen.
You've been a great crowd.
A mind reader, huh?
That seems kind of hocus-pocus, now, don't it?
It's as crazy as... oh, let's say the fact... that nobody can recall what happened that night... the night that a policeman and his motorcycle simply vanished.
Well, maybe I'm just an ignorant old country lawyer... but this sounds like a cover-up.
Or is it magic?
Do you believe in magic?
The Monarch must, for he's given us no other rational explanation.
Something big is going down.
This place is crawling with Strangers.
You can't expect to know everybody.
No, Hank.
Strangers are undercover Guild operatives.
We gotta warn Pop!
No, Dean.
This is Guild business.
Your father isn't in any harm.
The Guild works clean, professional.
It's surgical with them.
In a way, they're the only organization I still respect.
And they kill clean.
Don't let dames get in the way.
Honestly, Hank, where do you pick that stuff up?
I never see you read.
It's weird, right?
It's like he channels dead crazy people.
You think it's a cry for help?
So... a mind reader.
Fascinating.
Could you read the mind of, let's say, for instance, the Monarch?
If it would please the court.

This is most unorthodox.
Unorthodox?
The defendant's in a crown, for God's sake!
I myself am growing from the torso of an inbred simpleton.
I promise not to make his eyes boil.
I'll... allow it.
Hug me.
Fine.
Whatever gets you off, man.
Just don't go for the reach-around... because the Monarch doesn't swing that...
Sleep!
Dream.
All right, what's going on here?
Oh, just doing some... gardening.
I got a call from a concerned citizen there's a domestic going on here.
Listen, Officer Poncharello, my second-in-command just left me.
So why don't you put your fat Tom-of-Finland ass... back on your big gay bike and go home?
This is none of your beeswax.
OK, pal, let's just keep those hands where I can see them.
Oh, you want some of this?
Let's go, Fonzie.
Come on.
Take your best shot!
Think you can take this?
So, too fast for you?
It's all there.

It's a Freeze-Team!
Down on the ground and hold your breath.
There's pee pee on the floor!
I told you to hold your breath.
Take the prisoner.
For everyone else, I want a level three memory wipe.
Move!
Finally, number three on the Guild's most wanted list...
Tiny Attorney.
It's time the Guild sentences him to a "Trial Separation."
Ha!
I just made that up.

Twenty seconds.
Continue, Mr. Orpheus.
You were saying?

- A redhead.
He's gonna blow it.
Brock, when did you get back?
What happened to the little guy riding the retard?

Everybody's staring at me.
That's good soup!
In the Iast episode
- Avery bad cycle has begun
- From now on, I'm your partner
Everything is under control
- still, there have been three suspicious deaths within a week
- I can't keep people from shooting themselves
- As for Mrs Von Trieck, I'm grieving like everyone else
These marks look identical to the ones you'd find on the skin of people on whom they tested a device invented by
Doctor Edouard Paquette
Edouard who?
- Oh my God!
- Any leads?
Suspects?
Anything at all?
Josee, call agent CorbeiI from national Security, it's urgent
And what about the TV, do you know anything about that?
- "He who gathers the mane has seen and will see again"
- Gastonne loves me because she thinks I'm a man
I have one ovary and one testicle I'm not a man
- That's why blanche gave him the book
Pierre is the heiress to her powers
- hello?
- Doctor
Are you in your office?
- Yes, obviously
Doctor
tell me you're alone?
alone?
Of course I'm
Doctor?
Doctor!
- He's not here but I know where to find him
Marcoux!
I had a vision
Oh no
please
GREAT BEAR
You don't seem happy to see me Paquette
I usually see you in my nightmares
I'm not sure I'm awake
- Even after ten years, you're still bitter?
Look, this is what I was talking about
Every time I get within a fifty kilometer radius of Great Bear, everything stops
- But it comes back fairly quickly?
- Yes, quickly enough
Do you understand any of it?
No
Pierre Lamy bisexual
And Gastonne who had a thing for him
I didn't see that coming
When it comes to women, you still have a Iot to Iearn Biron
But we don't care about that story
Maybe you don't, but I
No, no, Biron, wake up!
Forget about that OK?
I'm not interested in village gossip
The old woman got killed and all of a sudden, some stupid videos appear on TV
Who can that be useful to?
That's what we're looking for
Biron?
AII right, listen;
I didn't say
village gossip
I heard you loud and clear
I didn't mean professionally I was only saying
That's fine I've had enough of being treated like twit
By Simone, by you
Listen Biron, I
I don't know what to say
- Never mind
- Not so loud
AII right, the footprints here
Those are Sarah's and her little friends
- Yeah, so?
- well, look around:
the house is spic'n'span, it always is
When you went out after ten o'cIock, did you see them?
surely not
- You mean
- surely not because blanche wouldn't have left mud tracks here all night
No
The tracks were done after you went out
Yes, yes, yes
What were those kids doing here so late that night?
I don't know you're interested in village gossip now?
- It's about time you got here
- Put your men under my command
As of now, I'm in charge of everything
- Sure, sure, that's fine
What?
Who's a hermaphrodite?
What's wrong with Doc Mondoux?
Oh, I can't take it anymore
shot him straight through the heart
- Who?
- No idea
No one saw anything
- Doctor Mondoux!
I saw everything
I had a vision
What?
"follow the great bear's tail"
The third sentence says:
"follow the great bear's tail at night"
Isn't the Big Dipper also called the "Great Bear"?
I see dippers everywhere!
- Ah, you're right you know
That's the problem with blanche
Sure, she had a gift but her parables never led me very far
I need something concrete
- There
I got it!
- And why didn't she give that piece of paper to me?
No Had to be for the big star from the big city
- Come on Biron, nothing against you
BIanche said that by saving her soul, I couId free mine
Who knows what that really means but I'm starting to think she wasn't as crazy as she looked
Shit!
I lost it!
- Lapointe
- Ah, OK!
Got it!
- Lapointe
- AII right follow the bear's tail;
maybe if we follow the orientation of the of the constellation
- Lapointe!
- What?
unless "follow the bear's tail"
simply means
"follow the bear's tail"
Come on Biron, come on!
Hey, we can't find Pierre anywhere
With what happened to blanche and Poitras,
I'm starting to get worried
Sophie thinks Pierre is the "heiress"
BIanche gave him the book;
he is part woman and it was always 'her' who had the most talent
Oh my God
It's only because something bad has happened to every one who appeared on TV, OK Sweetheart?
Nobody can hurt you here
- Honey, I have to talk to you
- I'm sorry Sweetheart; it's for your own protection
- Yep, with certain women you must use a Iot of protection
- Hey!
assholes, what's your problem?
- Honey Listen to me
- Hey smartasses!
Shut up!
- Listen to me!
- Marcoux Something's moving on TV
Wait!
- That bear is running fast!
- I don't think it's wise to run after a bear at night
- Come on Biron Where has your enthusiasm gone?
- What do we do if he turns around?
It's a mighty big bear
- Oh stop it!
I haven't had this much fun since the Lambert case in '92
- What?
This has nothing to do with it
The Lambert case, that was serious
There were criminals, a political scandal, documents
It was a real investigation damn it!
Look at us!
We're not journalists; we're two weirdoes with flashlights, following a bear in the forest
- Damn!
We lost it!
- Damn We lost it
But what are we doing here anyway?
- Ah!
Biron, nobody's forcing you to follow me
You're the one who pulled me into this
- Yeah, because we were supposed to work on a case together
I had a chance to launch my career
But now, I find myself stuck in the middle of the woods, trying to save a washed up alcoholic's soul
- well, that's just it!
They didn't send me here to make your career
They sent me here to destroy what was left of mine
They sent me here so I'd get lost
But I'm starting to find myself, I can feel it
Yeah, right!
You couldn't even find your way back to the hotel
- Oh no That's the bear
- Yeah and he's pissed!
Stay here, stay here
BIanche
We're getting married in two days
Do you think it's really over?
Do you think I'm cured?
- It's not an illness HeIène;
it's a state of mind
- She's talking to blanche
- It has nothing to do with my mind
It's in my body
It gets me, right here, it overtakes me
I can't think about anything else
I couldn't
But now it's different
Thanks to you and thanks to him
- It is your mind, HeIène;
your body is not interested in uniforms
- But that's the problem:
I'd rather he didn't wear one
Because that's not why I Iove him
- You see?
You've changed
You must tell him
- No
He wouldn't love me if he knew
No We're getting married
How could I Iook him in the eyes?
If he knew
If he knew that I slept with practically everything wearing a uniform in Great Bear
With all the guys he works with, sometimes several at a time
I did things I would never do with him
- You have to tell him, yes, it's only a matter of time
- No
- It's only a matter of time
No, Marcoux!
She threw herself at us, I swear!
I didn't know you back then
You changed everything
Since you
I've never cheated on you
Marcoux?
Marcoux
Marcoux, calm down
Do it
Do it
Marcoux, please
If you don't love me anymore, kill me
Marcoux!
Who was that crazy guy?
- Looks like Marcoux, Gastonne's partner
Come on
I've been here before
Yeah
This is where the old woman brought me
This is where I got hit on the head
Biron!
Biron?
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK
I just fell
- What's that?
That's blanche's necklace
This is where the bear wanted to take us
The autopsy report said the body was partially buried
- But why half bury somebody?
- Because you get caught
- Here, in the middle of the night?
There's not even a car on Main Street
In any case, I don't think the murder was pre-meditated
I think it was an accident
The blow to the head I got;
that wasn't an accident
- No THAT, I'm sure was intentional
But if I wanted to kill someone and bury them,
I'd bring a shovel
Now this hole wasn't dug by hand but just about
You're making progress
Must be the experience kicking in
Listen
I'm sorry about Pierre
I knew you had a thing for him
- Never mind
Story of my Iife
always one step behind or one foot off the track
If I fell in love, it had to be with a guy with with him
- Right
hello, central?
still no sign of Marcoux?
- No, not yet
- Thanks tell the chief we have new evidence on the Von Trieck case
- OK, 10-4
I thought you weren't involved in that investigation?
My father is busy with the national Security agent who got here last night
Oh, that's right, you don't know;
Doctor Mondoux is dead
We found him murdered, in his office
This, is all we have on the murder of blanche Von Trieck
Reports, depositions, analysis
- You know very well it's the TV transmission that interests me, not the old woman
- Maybe, but I've got to find a guilty party or I'm deadbeat
- BeIiveau!
There's a wacko in the interrogation room who says he saw the doctor get killed, in his dreams
Take his deposition;
I've got better things to do
- But the wacko is
- Yeah, yeah
When things went wrong ten years ago,
Paquette destroyed everything Documents, data
He didn't teach his method to anyone
Besides, he doesn't want to take up his research again
He's got support from higher up
But Paquette is still the only one who can help us understand what's going on
In any case, that's what we thought until now
Because now it seems that there's someone else here
I haven't felt like this in years, Catherine
I thought I had lost him but now
I'm on the verge of finding him again
I have a son
A real Ferron, a fighter
- You can't trust that kid AII he wants is our downfall
- No, he's changed
- You can't change just like that, Georges
You can't go from hating to
- He didn't hate me; he just didn't understand me
He sees that I always wanted the best for him I'm sure
- I'II call you back
- I'II call you back
Georges, this is
- nicole CorbeiI, national Security
What can I do for you?
Just the question I wanted to hear
Miss
- What can I do for you, dear sir?
- Have you already forgotten our date?
- Ah, but it wasn't set
I won't accept anything less than "The Tortoise and the Hare"
at the end of Main Street And fix yourself up
- Refined, demanding I knew it!
- Yeah, I hear you have a gift for seizing the essence of a woman in no time
- I was only trying to cheer up poor Biron
But
I wasn't far from the truth
- It's often dangerous to get too close to the truth, you know?
- Is that a challenge or a warning?
- A bit of both
I'II tell you a little story, Georges, to make you understand why we need you
Ever heard of Edouard Paquette, the scientist?
- Since yesterday only
- Great neurologist
About twelve years ago, with a device that he created, he was able to decode the electrical brain waves of his lab rats
He read the rats' thoughts?
Better than that
He transformed them into images and projected them on screen
The rat thinks about a piece of cheese and
A piece of cheese appears on screen
I don't know if you can imagine all of the research possibilities this would have opened up, Georges?
Why "would have"?
He's not dead
Paquette started to experiment on humans and it went wrong
- The coward stopped everything;
we were on the verge of
- You were involved?
Why are you telling me this?
I don't want to know about any of it
- Too late Georges
You already know too much
Damn
What am I going to do with you now?
- Hey, what is this?
I need someone who knows the region well and has the resources to help us do what we have to do, in total discretion
- You can't talk about this to anyone
national Security
- OK, I won't, but I won't do anything for you either Find someone else
- Too late, Georges
- In exchange for your zealous and immediate collaboration,
I promise to look the other way regarding that little business you run on the side
- I didn't have a choice,
I swear
- Good thing I have you
- Yeah, that's true
Everybody's against you, but I'm here
At your service, my beloved
- They're not against me, they're going crazy, don't you see?
Isn't anybody noticing?
I thought it was just my family
Good thing I have you
- "He who gathers the mane has seen and will see again"
What's that hairdresser's name again?
The one with both sexes
- Pierre Lamy
He belongs to a group who took
BIanche's stories very seriously
- Don't you ever sleep?
- Come on Biron, you slept a whole half hour in the car
- Oh shit
- No no no
- well, well; small world
- A little too small if you ask me
- I'm not finished with you, you little crook
- I'm sorry about your wife and what I did in court
I regret it What do you want me to ?
- Wasn't a nice bunch of people you were working for, kid
It's hard to keep your nose clean when you play in shit
I'II see you again in court, but this time
- Hey!
Get over it!
It's been ten years!
- Mind your own business, you goody-two-shoes!
- Excuse me?
- Since I've been here, I've seen you act like the immaculate little girl, hoIier than thou
Mamma's girl who thinks she's above everybody, who pretends to love people but who actually looks down on them
- will you just shut your big mouth?
- Never mind, that's what he wants, lets go
Yeah, bye-bye
See you around
- Think what you want of me, Mr Lapointe
But there's one thing I'm sure of
people change
Sometimes from bad to good
And sometimes from good to bad
Look into your heart, you know it's true
If you want to preach, there are plenty of mountains around
"Look into your heart "
Did you hear that Biron
She got you good!
It's closed; what do we do?
closed will not drop pants for anyone
- For the hundredth time, all we want is to ask you a few questions
- I know you, journalists
- Can you tell him we don't give a damn what's between his legs?
- We're investigating blanche's murder, Pierre, that's all
- That's police business
- Do you want us to send you the police?
Biron, call the station
tell them that Pierre Lamy will explain to them why he was hiding in Mrs Von Trieck's house, the night she was killed
Where is the book Pierre?
- I don't have it anymore
They stole it from me
- Who did?
Why?
- I don't know
Because
- Biron, call the police
- No, wait!
BIanche hadn't been feeling well for a while
She sensed she didn't have much longer 9-1-1 !
Anybody!
She tried to hide it from us, but it just worried us even more
Everyone knew that when blanche would die,
her powers would be transmitted to someone else
- Yeah right
- It's always been that way, EmiIe
The book is there to prove it
But I couldn't understand why she didn't want to say to whom
So, when I Ieft work that night,
I went to her place to ask her for the hundredth time:
who ?
When I got there, I saw you leaving with blanche
That's when I decided to go in
I didn't want to steal the book
I wanted to find clues inside
It was all written in Dutch
But I couldn't stop reading
I was continuously turning page after page
I don't know how long that went on for and then, they came in
- Who?
- The children
Sarah and her friends
They took the book
I'm sure
- Did you tell this to the police?
- Are you nuts?
And you don't have anything to tell either
I have enough problems as it is
EmiIe
Sarah isn't "normal"
- Georges!
- He's our associate, he stays here
He knows everything now anyway
- It's too risky
He's young, foolish and unreliable
Even if he's changed his mind about us, which I doubt
- I think I'm not done surprising you, "Auntie"
- In any case, I need someone to run the operations while I'm gone to
- Georges, what's he doing here?
- Christian works with us now
- But
- Don't worry, handsome;
I won't tell Stephanie you're dealing drugs behind her back
She, who did everything to get you away from your old gang
- They're forcing me to!
- Yeah but you take your share, don't you?
- I don't talk to my old gang, OK?
They don't know I'm in Great Bear Georges?
- Don't worry, Armand, I won't tell them you're here;
they want you dead
Come on, I wouldn't do that to you
- Christian will be in charge of organizing the next deal
You do as he says
I'II coach him
- Georges
- He can do it
He's a Ferron
Anyway, I
I have a few problems to take care of at the mine
- She's not normal
Coming from him, that's something!
- What do you think?
- well, I think he'd never touch one hair off my head
Grave-robbing kids I don't know what he's shooting up but that's not just testosterone
Think about that, Biron
- See you Lapointe
Armand LafIamme
That little brat
It's nice to come home, eh?
Sarah,
I'd really like you to talk to me
We used to laugh, you and I
You know,
BIanche is gone but I can feel her with us
Do you feel it too?
It's nice of you guys to come by but isn't it a little late?
How did you know she was back?
It's her
She missed us so she called us
We'II go now
Thanks for the invitation
I really appreciate your company
- I couId tell you you'd appreciate it better in more horizontal circumstances
But
- I think our relationship is still fairly oblique, perhaps?
- Sinuous, yes, zigzagging at the limit
But oblique?
In a way, maybe
- I'm assuming you are referring to all the gossip you must have heard about me and Georges, my sister's husband?
well, you should know that it's almost all true
But it's over, that story had lasted for much too long
- I'm not sure George would say the same, but
No, that's not what I was going to talk to you about
Armand LafIamme;
I saw you with him
- He's my niece's boyfriend
- Your niece who loves you so
- I'm trying to get as close to her as I can
It's not easy
- Yeah, I can understand
- Armand is a good guy
- If I may
- Mr Lapointe; since you are so perceptive, why don't you tell me what you really think, honestly
- About what?
- About me
After that we'II go to bed
Our separate ways
This time
- You see Catherine, if I told you what I really think of you, the words I would use wouldn't be decent enough for a couple of sophisticated people like you and I on their first date
But
I can tell you what I see
What I saw right away, the first time
What I see is a woman with a deep wound, a love that's too big, a love that people around her are incapable of taking
and even less of returning
Before you
I've known only one other person like that
- See you again soon, Mr Lapointe
Thank you
What did I tell you?
They can't stand it without TV
They'd pay a hundred bucks to see a puppet show!
- Not bad, but the TV will come back eventually
- What would you know about that?
- Nothing, but wait to see the margin of profit on those little candies we're cooking up,
Armand will show you that later
- Yeah, speaking of Armand
- One thing a time
We still need him
- Look at them!
They're all waiting for the next scandal
- Oh no!
Watch them closely; they're shaking
They're all shitting their pants, afraid of being the next one to appear
still no sign of Marcoux?
- Not yet
- Pierre what did he say?
- Nothing
I mean
He had a vision about the doctor
He didn't talk to me personally
And it's by following a bear that you ended up where blanche's necklace was?
- I know it doesn't make sense
- With blanche, everything made sense, eh?
So, the next clue would be: "Got cells"
- Yeah, well, they've been in order since the beginning
What about Mondoux?
- Nothing much
He was clutching a little piece of paper in his hand when he died We're looking into it but
- well, what's wrong?
I just want to go get my brother
- Go home you whore!
Sam!
Come here
Sam!
Let's go
- I'II go get him
- Thanks
- Thank you
- You're welcome
- Marcoux will come back, you'II see
- You think so?
Anyway, things will never be the same
If only blanche was here
She could
I don't know, make him understand
- But didn't she say there would be another woman?
Who would inherit her powers?
- Who?
Sophie thinks Pierre is blanche's heiress
- Sorry
- That's OK
But what about little Sarah?
- Sarah?
It's true
There's something but not quite the same as blanche
I don't know
- Got cells got cells
- samuel!
- Got cells got cells
- Biron!
- Wait, wait!

I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.

- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?

Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.

She's a beautiful boat and I hope you get her soon.
- You've earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.
- You have.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.
Come on.
Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
- Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.

I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
# I love New York...

- # New York
# I love New York
# I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
- This belong you?
- Thank you.
Oh, shit.
See?
Wet floor.
That you.
I'm so late.

- Yes.
Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Wait.
For you.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Sensible heels.
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.
I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.
Excuse me, buddy.
What's going on?
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your order?
Keep the change.
Excuse me.
OK, go.
Go.
Good boy.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your...
"Crisis.
Crisis in Krakozhia."
Now that heavy fighting has subsided and both sides have dug in for the long winter ahead, it's clear that the future of Krakozhia may be in doubt for some time to come.
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia suffer the consequences.
"And food... in..."

"...in Krakozhia."
"The story of Broadway is the..."

"It's a miracle."
"Korean conjoined twins separated today in Maine."
"Chances of survival 50-50."
50-50.
Next.
Let me ask you something, Mr. Navorski.
Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
- Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!
Put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down.
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.

Viktor.
Viktor, just tell me more.
I coming.
I coming.
Please, please.
Beeper went off.
Started beeping.
So, I grab.
I come.
We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
Damn.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English...
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?

I...
I can't go out... with you.

It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.

Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
OK.
Who is this?

There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
OK.
Just bring it.
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
I have two nines and two nines.
Four nines.
Thank you.
- Careful.
- Watch out.
- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.
What is in the can?
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.
We know there's no nuts in there.
What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
"You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or?
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
Viktor.
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down!
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.

Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
Come on.
Oh...
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
Your attention please.

I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!

Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
- Thank you.
- OK.
All right.
Thanks, Judge.

Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr. Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
I love New York...
- I love it!
- New York
I love New York
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.

The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.

You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.

We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...

I hate it when they delay flights.

I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.

Have a seat.

- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.

Four nines.
Thank you.

- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.
What is in the can?
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.
We know there's no nuts in there.
What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.

I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?

So, will we share the panties?

- Come on.
- Wait a second.
United Airlines flight number 80 1 to Narita
United Airlines flight number 80 1 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
"You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.

How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down!
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
Come on.
Oh...
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
...the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
...reijoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
Your attention please.
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm...
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.
There's something you should know.
Ladies and gentlemen, United Airlines Flight 865 from Krakozhia has landed and is now taxiing to the gate.

I am going home.
Get lost.
Your attention, please.

He's going home.
He's going for the front door, out to the city.
What?
Viktor.
Remember us.
From the Discovery Store, I want to give you this.
It's good luck.
A digital camera for cousin Katia.
I don't know where you're going, but these will keep your feet warm.
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.
Secure the door.
Sorry, Viktor.
Take him, Judge.
Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.
You see those doors?
Those are the entry doors to New York City.
To the United States of America.
Turn around.
It's snowing in the city and you're going to need that.
Good luck.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
No, no.
I'm going to miss you.
Try not to get stuck wherever you're going.

Yeah.
Yes, I am.
Benny Golson, I am Viktor Navorski.
I am from Krakozhia.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, was great, great fan of your music.
A jazz fan.
Fantastic.
Would you sign your name, please?
Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.

OK.

OK, Mr Navorski, I need to see your return ticket, please.
No, your return ticket.
Your...
- Oh...
Yes.
- Ah.
[Woman screams]
This is just a standard procedure.
I'm going to need the passport also.
Oh...
OK.
- No, no.
- Thank you.
Mr Navorski.
That.
Passport.
That.
Mr Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk, I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all travelling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
[Dixon laughs]
- Thank you.
- OK.
All right.
Thanks, Judge.

There's only one thing you can do here, Mr Navorski.

Come on.
Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
- Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
[Both laugh]
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
[Chuckles]
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.

Sir.

I love New York...
- I love it!
- ?
New York
?
I love New York
?
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[Snoring]
[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[Woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.

Food document, trash.

I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
[Man speaks German]
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[Whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[Camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [Thurman] To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- [Thurman] Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.
Thank you.

The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[Chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?

Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.

So, I grab.
I come.
[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [Laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?

OK.

- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?

Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.

I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counselling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[Sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[Laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...

I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.

- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
[Jazz plays on personal stereo]
[Enrique] We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
[Gupta] OK.
Just bring it.
- [Enrique] Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
- [Enrique] We have a question for you.
- [Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
- [Viktor] This?
- [Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[All laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favourites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumour has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[Pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase Licence.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[Whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[Chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the licence.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[Man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[Sighs]
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[Cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[Clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[Pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [Pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [Pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[Both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[Camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[Cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[Footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian]
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [Bleats] - [All bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
[All cheer]
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.

Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.

Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.

I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.

Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.

Why doesn't he try to escape?

I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.

- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.

Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
Damn.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English...
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I...
I can't go out... with you.
God.
I am so...
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.
Wet floor.
Wet floor.

No, I...
Please, I...
No, I...
Please, I...

Gate 67.
You got to be kidding.
You got to help me help you.
I don't see a Social Security number mailing address, even a phone number.
Telephone?
You need?
I get.

I get phone.

451 -1 226.
All right.
When's the best time to reach you?
Now?
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Navorski.
Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.
- How's it going?
- Good.
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
OK.
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- It's no one.
There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
OK.
Just bring it.
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
I have two nines and two nines.
Four nines.
Thank you.
- Careful.
- Watch out.
- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.
What is in the can?
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.
We know there's no nuts in there.
What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
"You can't.
That is mine. "
"You can get so confused. "
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1 200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$1 9 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.1 2.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.1 2 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
Viktor.
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down!
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today. "
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $1 49.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1 7 42 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
But the town bakers...
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 1 8 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
Then what are you waiting for?
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 1 3 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?

Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.

He say he look at photograph for seven days.

After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
...the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.

But you didn't understand.

It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.

Destiny.
...rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.

It is a clear sign of the power...

I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?

To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.

It's time for you to go home.

Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1 979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
Your attention please.
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.

- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm...
Look at me.

Secure the door.
Sorry, Viktor.
Take him, Judge.
Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.
You see those doors?
Those are the entry doors to New York City.

It's snowing in the city and you're going to need that.
Good luck.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

Mr Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all travelling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
Krakozhia.
Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
And this apple...
Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
Krakozhia.
We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
I am crack.
Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.

Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.

That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
You've waited a long time for this.
I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.

We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.

Mr Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[Snoring]
[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
Sir, you told him to wait.
I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[Woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
You want him back in the holding cell?
No, I'll show him the door.

Excuse me.
[Man speaks German]
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
Secret?
Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
And no one will be watching you.
So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
There he is.
No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[Whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
Call the Airport Police.
He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[Camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
[Thurman] To the left of here.
No.
He was at the door.
[Thurman] Just go a little left.
All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.

You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
Was it microfilm?
A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[Chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.

Sir, what will that person do?

I'll take it from here.

It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
[Country music plays]
- [Max] Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!
Put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down.
You try to take my mop.

It's a man of misery.

Man of misery.
He's so sick.

Please, please.
[Beeping, clunk]
[Viktor] Beeper went off.
Started beeping.
So, I grab.
I come.
[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [Laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
Your country's at war.
Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
Yes.
It's terrible.
Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
I'm afraid from ghosts.
Thanks very much.
I'm afraid from Dracula.
Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counselling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[Sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[Laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English...
Viktor Navorski.
In English, Amelia Warren.
Amelia Warren?
Nice to meet you.
You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I...
I can't go out... with you.
God.
I am so...
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.
Wet floor.
Wet floor.

No, I...
Please, I...

The position has already been filled.

You got to be kidding.
You got to help me help you.

[Phone rings]

Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.
- How's it going?
- Good.
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
[Cliff] OK.
[Woman screams]
[Shrieks]
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- [Worker] It's no one.
[Worker] There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- [Viktor] I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
[Jazz plays on personal stereo]
[Enrique] We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
[Gupta] OK.
Just bring it.
- [Enrique] Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
Who invited him?
I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
I'm not going to play with him.
Gupta, relax, would you?
He isn't a spy.
How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
OK.
So you are clean.
Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
[Enrique] We have a question for you.
[Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
[Viktor] This?
[Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[All laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
Or salsa.
Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
No, no, is jazz.
OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
Come on.
Wait a second.
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
[Amelia] How are you?
[Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
Let's just start over.
Yes, OK.
Are you coming or going?
I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favourites.
You know what saved Napoleon's life?
No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
Glasses?
Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumour has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
There you go.
And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
You'll have lunch with me?
Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[Pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
I have to go.
I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
Did you try the FBI?
I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
What do you import?
Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
It'll have to wait.
No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
Where's he from?
Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
We have to get someone to talk to him.
I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
I help you?
Why?
I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
New York.
OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase Licence.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
What?
Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
Goat?
Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[Whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
It's not for his dying father?
No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[Chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the licence.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[Man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
Who was it that saved him?
Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
It doesn't look good, Frank.
I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[Sighs]
Is that for me?
Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
No.
I can't do this.
You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
They're always ready for sex.
OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
Keep looking.
Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
When she come back?
Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.

Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
What did you say?
You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
You killed policeman?
No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[Cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
[Amelia] What time?
[Viktor] Dinnertime.
[Amelia] Where do you want to go?
[Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
Same.
That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[Clattering]
So, the bakers?
No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
That's the truth.
You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[Pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [Pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
What?
I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
You live at the airport?
Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
For a flight, for a meeting...
I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [Pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
Come here.
What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[Both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[Camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
I have to work.
He will wait.
[Cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
How was your flight?
Good.
Thanks.
Is something wrong?
You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
Has he told you where he lives?
No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
At least you're not very good at it.
I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[Footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian]
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [Bleats] - [All bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
You know my friend in Washington.
Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
I go New York?
Yes.
I go New York!
[All cheer]
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
I think you were confused.
No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
I told you this is over.
I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
Do you understand?
Yes.
OK.
Good.

We'll help you.
Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
Please let me help you.
This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
The war is over.
Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.

Mr Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all travelling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.

I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
?
I love New York...
- I love it!
- ?
New York
?
I love New York
?
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[Snoring]
[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[Woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
[Man speaks German]
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[Whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[Camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [Thurman] To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- [Thurman] Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.
Thank you.
[Shrieks]
[Woman] Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
- This belong you?
- Thank you.
Oh, shit.
See?
Wet floor.
That you.
I'm so late.
Buenos Aires.
I can't remember the gate.
Gate 24.
- You sure?
- Yes.
Thanks.
[Tannoy] Ladies and gentlemen...
Wait.
For you.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Sensible heels.
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.
[Gupta] I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.
[Music plays]
Excuse me, buddy.
What's going on?
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.
[Coins jangle]
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your order?
Keep the change.
Excuse me.
OK, go.
Go.
Good boy.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your...

Brass band plays]
"Crisis.
Crisis in Krakozhia."
Now that heavy fighting has subsided and both sides have dug in for the long winter ahead, it's clear that the future of Krakozhia may be in doubt for some time to come.
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia suffer the consequences.
"And food... in..."
... have caused food and energy shortages.
"...in Krakozhia."
[Shouts in Bulgarian]
[Speaks Bulgarian]
"The story of Broadway is the..."
"The cast of comedy hit Friends which is set in New York."
[Speaks Bulgarian] Friends.
[Speaks Bulgarian] Friends.
[Tannoy] Due to the heavy snowfall, all flights have been cancelled... [all groan]
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
"Wayne Newton is 61 today."
"It's a miracle."
"Korean conjoined twins separated today in Maine."
"Chances of survival 50-50."
50-50.
Next.
Let me ask you something, Mr Navorski.
Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[Chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
[Shrieks]
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
[Country music plays]
- [Max] Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!
Put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down.
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.
It's my job.
Stay off my floor.
Stay away from my mop.
- Food.
- If you touch it again, I kill you.
[Shrieks]
[Light switch]
Hey.

You help me to win her heart and you'll never go hungry again.
- I do this.

Promise?
- Yes.

Thank you.
What mean, "wild stallion"?
[Speaks Bulgarian]

[Speaks Spanish]
Now, listen, Viktor.
You can ask her something that is very important.
- OK.
- Look...
- I wait.
- Enjoy your visit.
Next.
- Officer Torres.
- Mr Navorski.

No.
I won't cheat.
She's a nice girl.
She won't take your chitting.
Next.
Officer Torres.
Have you been ever in the love?
Enough, Viktor.
Who is it?
Who's telling you to ask me these things?
It's a man of misery.
Misery?
- Mystery?
- No, no.
Misery.
Man of misery.
He's so sick.
He's so in love.
But what did she say?
She did say, "Next!
Next!"
And now she say, "Please.
Please come."

Wait.
[Shrieks]
- I coming now.
- No, wait.
Viktor.
Viktor, just tell me more.
I coming.
I coming.
Please, please.
[Beeping, clunk]
[Viktor] Beeper went off.
Started beeping.
So, I grab.
I come.
[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [Laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counselling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[Sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[Laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English...
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I...
I can't go out... with you.
God.
I am so...
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.
Wet floor.
Wet floor.

No, I...
Please, I...

[Cliff] OK.
[Woman screams]
[Shrieks]
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- [Worker] It's no one.
[Worker] There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- [Viktor] I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
[Jazz plays on personal stereo]
[Enrique] We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
[Gupta] OK.
Just bring it.
- [Enrique] Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
- [Enrique] We have a question for you.
- [Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
- [Viktor] This?
- [Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[All laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favourites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumour has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[Pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase Licence.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[Whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[Chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the licence.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[Man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[Sighs]
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[Cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[Clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[Pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [Pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [Pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[Both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[Camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[Cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[Footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian]
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [Bleats] - [All bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
[All cheer]
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
[Tannoy] Your attention please.

- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm... [sighs]
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.

Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.

I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
- Thank you.
- OK.
All right.
Thanks, Judge.

I'm going to need you to look at me.
Beyond those doors is American soil.
Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear that you are not to enter through those doors.
You are not to leave this building.
America is closed.
America closed.
What I do?
There's only one thing you can do here, Mr. Navorski.

- Actually, I bought her yesterday.
Come on.
Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
- Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr. Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
I love New York...
- I love it!
- New York
I love New York
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.

I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.

What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- To the left of here.

He was at the door.

We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
Damn.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.

You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...

Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...

- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
"You can't.
That is mine. "
"You can get so confused. "
"You can get so confused. "
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
Viktor.
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down!
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today. "
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
But the town bakers...
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
Then what are you waiting for?
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
Come on.
Oh...
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.

Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.

After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
...the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
...reijoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
Your attention please.
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm...
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.
There's something you should know.
Ladies and gentlemen, United Airlines Flight 865 from Krakozhia has landed and is now taxiing to the gate.
For those passengers holding tickets for Flight 866 to Krakozhia, we expect departure to be on schedule.
Get back, please.
Gupta.
Gupta!
I am going home.
Get lost.
Your attention, please.
Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be delayed until further notice.
Do you have an appointment?
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on down there!
We're right behind you.
Viktor's leaving.
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know.
He's going home.
He's going for the front door, out to the city.
What?
Viktor.
Remember us.
From the Discovery Store, I want to give you this.
It's good luck.
A digital camera for cousin Katia.
I don't know where you're going, but these will keep your feet warm.
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.
Secure the door.
Sorry, Viktor.
Take him, Judge.
Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.
You see those doors?
Those are the entry doors to New York City.
To the United States of America.
Turn around.
It's snowing in the city and you're going to need that.
Good luck.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
No, no.
I'm going to miss you.
Try not to get stuck wherever you're going.
Arrest him!
Arrest him!
Goddammit!
Taxi!

I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
Oh!
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, okay?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
- Okay.
- Okay, what?
Okay.
Lunch... with you.
You'll have lunch with me?
Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...
I wait.
[beeping]
It's me.
You.
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
No.
Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
No?
No.
You little... farsighted.
I have to go.
I have to stay.
Story of my life.
Oh, me, too.
[Thurman] Your C.B.P. inspection's in three days.
The F.B.I. and Homeland Security will tour the airport at 9 a.m., spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
I believe they're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
Okay?
No country.
So, automatically he's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I'm asking that you put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
Damn it!
Country's detaining so many people, there's no goddamn room anywhere.
You try the F.B.I.?
Yes.
I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So, let's show them why this is the number one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger.
...to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
Import, export.
What do you import?
Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Um, yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, she makes me bring her back a bag.
Your mother-in-law?
Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How do you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his wedding ring?
And if he's divorced, who in their right mind still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offense to mother-in-laws, but...
Sir.
Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
It's gonna have to wait.
No, this won't wait.
When the 9:12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an M.P.L.
They tried to take the pills away, and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody, keep your weapons...
Yes, sir.
All right.
We're here to help!
Okay, okay.
We're here to help you.
All right.
Where's he from?
He's from Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
He'll be here in an hour.
We gotta find somebody to talk to this guy.
I have an idea.
Viktor?
Viktor.
Opa.
Oh!
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives across the border from you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
I help you?
Why?
I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down, and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
New York.
Okay, yes.
You say yes?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay!
Okay, okay, okay.
Mr. Milodragovich, we have somebody here to talk to you.
Stay out!
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[speaking Bulgarian]
[speaking Russian] [speaking Bulgarian]
So?
Okay.
Tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form.
He needs to have a medicinal purchase license.
Okay?
You understand me, Viktor?
[speaking Bulgarian]
[speaking Russian]
He say he bring... he bring the medicine for his father.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay, okay.
This why he go to Canada.
For medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the United States.
He needs the right form.
Okay, okay.
Eh...
[Bulgarian]
[Russian]
He did not know that he need this document.
No one say to him he need document.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who's treating his father and a doctor in Canada.
These medicines have to stay in the United States now that they're here.
[Bulgarian]
[Russian]
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
[speaking Russian]
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[speaking Bulgarian]
Send him down.
[Milodragovich shouts] [crying] All right, all right.
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.
Uh, goat.
What?
Goat, goat.
The medicine is for goat.
Goat?
Yes, yes.
Medicine is for goat.
[bleats] Goat.
He said that?
Yes.
He say... we not understand.
I not understand goat.
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
The medicine is not for his dying father?
No.
No.
Eh...
The...
Krakozhia, the name for "father"... sound like "goat."
I make mistake.
[laughing]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is, uh, for goat.
No, it's not.
Yes.
No, no, no.
Yes, yes.
You've been reading the immigration forms, the blue one.
Blue?
Yep.
Blue.
Blue?
Blue.
The blue form.
It says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's very good, Viktor.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was gonna help you.
I want you to ask him one last...
No.
Not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[speaking Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
Okay.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Come on, now.
Let's go.
Easy.
Take it easy.
Come on.
Goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat!
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
[sobbing]
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
Chestito.
Chestito, chestito.
No, no, no.
Please.
[speaking Russian]
Come on, now.
It's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell for another five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States of America.
Then you'll know why the people of Krakozhia wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply!
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire, to kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man said.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
Who was it that saved him?
Yeah, tell us who it was.
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
Doesn't look good, Frank.
I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules, ignore the numbers and concentrate on the people.
People.
Yeah, I know.
Compassion, Frank.
That's the foundation of this country.
I know, I know.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[sighs]
Hi.
Is that for me?
Yes.
Yes.
Is a Virgin Isle sailfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York, Viktor?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Eh...
Uh...
Promise.
A promise in the can?
Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the United States.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out of here.
No, no, no.
I can't do this.
You said you wanted us to help you.
I do.
What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
They're always ready for sex.
Why do you think they can't stop smiling?
Okay, I found something.
Shh!
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail, not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
Keep looking.
Warren, right?
Yes.
Yes.
Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
Jane?
Yeah.
Look at this.
Ooh.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
When she come back?
Uh, three weeks.
Oh!
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Gupta, you been ever married?
What did you say?
You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said okay.
This is common.
So I pay him.
But the next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day,
I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
You killed policeman?
No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home,
I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[woman over P.A.] United Airlines flight 2703 from Rome, Italy, is now arriving at gate C43.
Hey, wait!
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
Hey!
Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Amelia.
Viktor.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
You okay?
I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Oh.
Hugo Boss.
Uh, on sale 149.99.
That's a bargain.
Napoleon?
Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
You're asking me out for dinner?
Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
What time?
Dinnertime.
Where do you want to go?
I know place.
Do you have an appointment?
Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please, please.
Please, please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
Cannelloni, please.
Cannelloni.
Sorry.
Thank you.
For you, sir?
Uh...
Same.
That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
Tell me.
Okay.
Um, it's 1742, and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
But the town bakers... [beeping]
Sorry.
[beeping stops]
[clattering]
So, the bakers?
Ah.
Never mind.
It's a dumb story.
No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
I'm 39 years old.
No.
Yeah.
No.
That's the truth.
You are not.
Mm-hmm.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is alphabetical by city and my pager will always go off during dinner.
[beeping] [beeping stops]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
Just don't know what the hell for.
[rattling]
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
What?
I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
You live at the airport?
Yes.
Day and night.
Is home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
No.
Everybody.
For a flight, for a meeting...
No.
I don't wait for flight.
I don't wait for meeting.
Then what are you waiting for?
[beeping]
Is okay.
I understand.
I have an idea.
Come here.
What you do?
Ah.
You sure?
More than anything I'm sure of this, Viktor.
Ready?
[beeping]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
Thirteen days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But, um, what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you.
Thirteen days from now.
Hmm?
[water running] [clattering]
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[speaking Spanish] [continues in Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You're gonna get really fat with all the food I'm gonna give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
I have to work.
He will wait.
How was your flight?
Good.
Thanks.
Is something wrong?
You'll have to come with us, ma'am.
You got to be kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Dixon] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document... and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he... hides a can of Planters Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I mean...
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
Has he told you where he lives?
No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
He's a contractor?
Yeah.
That's what he said?
Mm-hmm.
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
It's okay, Viktor.
All men lie.
At least you're not very good at it.
I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
I...
Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Sit.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[grunts] [grunts]
[grunts]
Come on.
Ah, come...
Oh!
[speaking Bulgarian]
It no work.
It should shoot, uh, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
Fifty-seven of them altogether.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club New York.
Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He asks the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here all this time so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are... waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait."
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
The right wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [singing in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat."
- [bleats] - [all bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
Amelia, you here early.
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come, come.
See, the...
the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
You know my friend?
He works in Washington.
Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
Wha-
- Visa?
Yes.
From your friend?
Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
I go New York?
Yes.
I go New York!
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
I think you were confused.
No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny."
Destiny.
..rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
In the distance, a Krakozhian flag waved good-bye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power of the...
Hi, baby.
Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Dolores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The...
The war in my country... is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing.
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made C.B.P. Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, will you please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure that he does not miss his flight?
Good-bye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable."
I told you this is over.
I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job as field commissioner is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
Joe's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game, bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique, as it turns out, has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But as it turns out, he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
Today.
Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, Viktor, they're all gone.
Do you understand?
Yes, yes.
Okay.
Good.
Viktor, you don't have to do this.
You can fight these guys.
We'll help you.
Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
Please let me help you.
This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Good-bye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out those door, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
The war is over.
Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm...
Look at me.
Come on.
Look at me.
There's something you should know.
[woman over P.A.] Ladies and gentlemen, United Airlines flight 865 from Krakozhia has landed and is now taxiing to the gate.
For those passengers holding tickets for flight 866 to Krakozhia, we expect departure to be on schedule.
Gupta.
Gupta!
[sirens blaring]
I am going home!

Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk. I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right. I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply...
- ...unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski. I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- l am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out, I will allow you to enter the lnternational Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the lnternational Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.

You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.

[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?

I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.

Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?

At 1 2 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 1 2 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release. lt's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.

Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.

[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food. I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes. lt's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays. I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

I am not afraid from my home.
So?

- No?
OK.
- l'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- l'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[sobs] I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know,...
sometimes in the mornings, I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe,...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no. I am... I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English,...
Viktor Navorski.
- ln English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I...
I can't go out... with you.
God. I am so...
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.

Wet floor.

You got to be kidding.
You got to help me help you.

It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.

Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?

- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
[Cliff] OK.
[woman screams]
[shrieks]
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- [worker] lt's no one.
[worker] There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- [Viktor] I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
[jazz plays on personal stereo]
[Enrique] We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
[Gupta] OK.
Just bring it.
- [Enrique] Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- l see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- l did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- l'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- l'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
- [Enrique] We have a question for you.
- [Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
- [Viktor] This?
- [Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[all laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 80 1 to Narita
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 80 1 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- l don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah. I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1 200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs] I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick. I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[pager beeps]
- lt's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- l have to go.
- l have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The fbi and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$1 9 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.1 2.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the fbi?
- l tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- lt'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.1 2 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- l have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh... I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- l help you?
Why?
- l don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green. I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[speaks Bulgarian]
[speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know. I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[speaks Bulgarian] [woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat. lt medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- lt's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- lt doesn't look good, Frank.
- l was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up. lt's not over yet.
[sighs]
- ls that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No. I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- l do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No. I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
No, no, no. lt's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- l'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $1 49.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1 7 42 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind. lt's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
is histories. ls truth.
- l'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 1 8 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [pager vibrates] I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- l live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- l don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [pager beeps]
is OK. I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 1 3 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No. I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 1 3 days from now.
[camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him. I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me. lt will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- l have to work.
- He will wait.
[cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- ls something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles] I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia. I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.

And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.

And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You. I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
...the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".

It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.

Destiny.
...reijoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.

When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.

Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1 979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.

Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.

Mr. Navorski.

Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
[Dixon laughs]
- Thank you.

- Actually, I bought her yesterday.
Come on.
Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
- Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
[both laugh]
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?

I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.

Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr. Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
[speaks Bulgarian]
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
I love New York...
- I love it!
- New York
I love New York
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[snoring]
[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.

Food document, trash.

I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
[man speaks German] [speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [Thurman] To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- [Thurman] Just go a little left.

He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.

She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?

"It's a miracle."
"Korean conjoined twins separated today in Maine."
"Chances of survival 50-50."
50-50.
Next.
Let me ask you something, Mr. Navorski.
Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
[shrieks]
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
[country music plays]
- [Max] Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!
Put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down.
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.

Stay off my floor.
Stay away from my mop.

Hey.

[speaks Spanish]
Now, listen, Viktor.
You can ask her something that is very important.
- OK.
- Look...
- I wait.
- Enjoy your visit.
Next.
- Officer Torres.
- Mr. Navorski.

She won't take your chitting.
Next.
Officer Torres.
Have you been ever in the love?
Enough, Viktor.
Who is it?
Who's telling you to ask me these things?
It's a man of misery.
Misery?
- Mystery?
- No, no.
Misery.
Man of misery.
He's so sick.
He's so in love.
But what did she say?
But what did she say?
She did say, "Next!

And now she say, "Please.
Please come."

Wait.
[shrieks]
- I coming now.
- No, wait.
Viktor.
Viktor, just tell me more.
I coming.
I coming.
Please, please.
[beeping, clunk]
[Viktor] Beeper went off.
Started beeping.
So, I grab.
I come.
[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English...
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I...
I can't go out... with you.
God.
I am so...
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.
Wet floor.
Wet floor.

No, I...
Please, I...

You got to be kidding.
You got to help me help you.

Telephone?
You need?

Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.

- Good.
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
[Cliff] OK.
[woman screams]
[shrieks]
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- [worker] It's no one.
[worker] There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- [Viktor] I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
[jazz plays on personal stereo]
[Enrique] We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
[Gupta] OK.
Just bring it.
- [Enrique] Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
- [Enrique] We have a question for you.
- [Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
- [Viktor] This?
- [Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[all laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 80 1 to Narita
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 80 1 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[speaks Bulgarian]
[speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[speaks Bulgarian] [woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[sighs]
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.

Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian]
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
...the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [bleats] - [all bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
[all cheer]
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
...reijoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.

- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.

You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm... [sighs]

Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the U.S.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air, there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia!
Krakozhia.
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Let me...
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
- Krakozhia.
Yes.
Okay.
- Krakozhia.
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
Okay?
No more Krakozhia.
Okay?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently, you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the U.S. recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply...
- ...unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge,
Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
Okay.
Okay.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically, it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
"Talking Tina," "Nightmare at 30,000 Feet," "Zanti Misfits."
"Zanti Misfits" was Outer Limits, sir.
Oh, really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
Okay, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Walk with me.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the U.S. and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free to go anywhere you like within the confines of the International Transit Lounge.
- Okay?
- Okay
- Okay?
- Okay
Okay.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Judge.
Now, Mr. Navorski.
This is the International Transit Lounge.
You are free to wait here.
These are food vouchers.
You can use them in the Food Court.
Your Krakozhian money is no good here.
This is a 15-minute, prepaid calling card.
You may call home, if you like.
This, in case we need to contact you, is a pager.
You must keep this with you at all times.
Here is an ID badge for you to get into CBP.
Beyond those doors...
Mr. Navorski.
I'm going to need you to look at me.
Beyond those doors is American soil.
Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear that you are not to enter through those doors.
You are not to leave this building.
America is closed.
America closed.
What I do?
There's only one thing you can do here, Mr. Navorski.
Shop.
Ladies and gentlemen, passengers of flight 854... the international community tries to make inroads to a peaceful resolution.

You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, backgrounds on the Chinese and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr. Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Next.
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time, you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9:30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12:00 today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12:00.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
United Airlines, final boarding call...
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
Okay.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
Are you sure?
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
Okay.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
- You got it.
There we go.
- Ah!
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Come on.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- To the left of here.
- No.
He was just at the door.
- Just go a little left.
- All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
Shit.
- This belong you?
Please, please.
- Thank you.
Oh, shit.
See?
Wet floor.
That you.
I'm so late.
Buenos Aires.
I can't remember the gate.
Gate 24.
- You sure?
- Yes.
Thanks.
Wait.
For you.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Sensible heels.
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.
I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- Oh, so, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.
Excuse me, buddy.
What's going on?
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your order?
Keep the change.
Excuse me.
Okay, go.
Go.
Good boy.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your...
"Crisis.
Krakozhia."
Now that heavy fighting has subsided and both sides have dug in for the long winter ahead, it's clear that the future of Krakozhia may be in doubt for some time to come.
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia suffer the consequences.
"And food..."
Have caused food and energy shortages.
"...
In Krakozhia."
"The story of Broadway is the..."
"The cast"
"of comedy hit Friends,"
"which is set in New York."
Friends.
Friends.
Due to the heavy snowfall, all flights have been canceled...
"Wayne Newton is 61 today."
"It's a miracle."
"Korean conjoined twins separated today in Miami."
"Chances of survival 50-50."
50-50.
Next.
Let me ask you something, Mr. Navorski.
Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the U.S.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14.
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
- Then ship him to detention.
- He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
- Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!
Put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down.
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.
It's my job.
Stay off my floor.
Stay away from my mop.
- Food.
- If you touch it again, I kill you.
Hey.
I'm Enrique Cruz.
We need to talk.
- I want to make a deal with you.
- What deal?
I need information on CBP Officer Torres.
You feed me information about her, and I'll feed you.
- What do you want know?
- You see her every day.
I want to know what makes her knees weak.
What makes her blood boil and her body tingle.
She's a wild stallion, and you'll help me break her.

- Officer Torres is wild stallion?
- Her name is Dolores.
You help me to win her heart, and you'll never go hungry again.

Promise?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Thank you.
What mean, "wild stallion"?
Officer Torres.
My friend say you are stallion.

Stand behind the yellow line.
- It's beautiful horse.
- Who said that?
- My friend drive the food.

Now, listen, Viktor.
You gotta ask her something that is very important.
Okay.

You, no chit.

She's a nice girl.
She won't take your chitting.
Next.
Officer Torres.
Have you been ever in the love?
Enough, Viktor.
Who is it?
Who's telling you to ask me these things?
It's a man of misery.
Misery?
- Mystery?
- No, no.
Misery.
Man of misery.
He's so sick.
He's so in love.
But what did she say?
She did say, "next, next."
And now she say, "Please.
Please come."
That's...
Wait.
- I coming now.
- No, wait.
Viktor.
Viktor, just tell me more.
I coming.
I coming.
Please, please.
Beeper went off.
Started beeping.
So, I grab.
I come.
We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
Asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mmm-hmm.
Fear.
- From what?
- That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question.
If you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
Okay.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
- You're afraid of Krakozhia.
- Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
Okay.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, okay?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know, sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe, maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This man has you.
Why he need puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
You headed for home?
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
Oh, I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Ah.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English,
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
No, I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I can't go out with you.
God.
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.
Wet floor.
- No, I...
- You don't have to explain.
Nadia.
In New York restaurant, what cost is cantaloni?
I don't know.
Maybe 15 bucks.

Two people, 40.
Two people, 40 dollars.
Two people, 40 dollars.

I'm so sorry, sir.
The position has already been filled.
- Do you live nearby?
- Yes.
Gate 67.
Because we are very particular about punctual...
Did you say Gate 67?
Gate 67.
You got to be kidding.
You got to help me help you.
I don't see a Social Security number... mailing address, even a phone number.
Telephone?
You need?
I get.
I get.
I get phone.
I get phone.
451-1226.
All right.
When's the best time to reach you?
Now?
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Navorski.
Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Ah!
Cliff.
Hello.
- How's it going?
- Good.
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- It's no one.
There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- I go now.
- Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine, and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6:30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6:30, yes, boss.
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
Okay.
Just bring it.
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Oh, Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- Okay.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
I have two nines and two nines.
Four nines.
- Careful, careful.
- Watch out.
Wait.
We have a question for you, Viktor.
Yeah, we're just curious.
What is in the can?
- What?
This?
- Yeah, we saw the x-ray.
We know there's no nuts in there.
What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- Okay, guys.
Okay.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And they belong to?
- Cher.
- Cher?
- As in Cher?
- Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
Flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding...
"You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, okay.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
- Tell me about it.
- Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap and usually about men killing each other.
Like 1,200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this.
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, okay?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
Okay.
- Okay, what?
- Okay.
Lunch with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
- You work?
- No.
Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
No.
You're farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Oh!
Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
Okay?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
Well, what about a federal prison?
Well, what about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger... to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offense to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9:12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away, and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
Viktor.
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down, and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- Okay, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out.
So?
Okay, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, he needs to have a Medicinal Purchase License.
Okay?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the U.S. He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
- He's begging you.
- I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down.
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Oh, oh, oh, hey.
Uh...
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
Medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat."
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"
sound like "goat."
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
Okay.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle sailfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the U.S.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside, and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- Okay, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said okay.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying, and I'm paying him, and I'm paying him, and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome, Italy, is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out.
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- Okay.
It's 1742, and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
But the town bakers...
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city, and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
Then what are you waiting for?
Is okay.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
- You sure?
- More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one, and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of dry roasted peanuts in his bag?
- So?
- What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
- Has he told you why he's in New York?
- No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's okay, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So, what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
Come on.
Oh... it no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper, 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait."
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
The right wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat."
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia.
Amelia.
You here early.
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace.
Peace.
The war.
The war.
Please come.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny."
Destiny.
Rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Dolores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable."
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Okay.
Good.
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm...
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.
There's something you should know.
Ladies and gentlemen, United Airlines Flight 865 from Krakozhia has landed and is now taxiing to the gate.
For those passengers holding tickets for Flight 866 to Krakozhia, we expect departure to be on schedule.
Gupta.
Gupta.
I am going home.
Get lost.
Your attention, please.
Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be delayed until further notice.
Do you have an appointment?
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on down there.
We're right behind you.
Viktor's leaving.
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know.
He's going home.
He's going for the front door, out to the city.
What?
Oh, my...
Viktor.
Remember us.
From the Discovery Store, I want to give you this.
It's good luck.
A digital camera for Cousin Katia.
I don't know where you're going, but these will keep your feet warm.
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.
Secure the door.
Sorry, Viktor.
Take him, Judge.
Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.
You see those doors?
Those are the entry doors to New York City.
To the United States of America.
Turn around.
It's snowing in the city, and you're going to need that.
Good luck.
Oh, no.
I'm going to miss you.
Try not to get stuck wherever you're going.
Arrest him!
Arrest him!
God damn it!
Taxi.
Thank you.
Where you go?

Please take Van Wyck Expressway to Queensboro Bridge.
It's faster than BQE.

Viktor Navorski.
I'm Goran.

- When do you come to New York?
- Thursday.
You want us to block the south exit and have AP sweep every vehicle?
Sir?

Yeah.
Yes, I am.
Benny Golson, I am Viktor Navorski.
I am from Krakozhia.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, was great, great fan of your music.
Oh, a jazz fan.
Fantastic.
Would you sign your name, please?
Oh.
Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.
- Just a minute.
- I will wait.
Okay.
Taxi.

Mr Navorski.

Mr Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all travelling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
[Dixon laughs]
- Thank you.
- OK.
All right.
Thanks, Judge.
[Door closes]

You can use them in the Food Court.
Your Krakozhian money is no good here.

What I do?
There's only one thing you can do here, Mr Navorski.

Has a 120-volt generator, wet bar, gas range.
She looks amazing.
She's my pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
She's a beautiful boat and I hope you get her soon.
- You've earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.
- You have.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.
Come on.
Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
- Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
[Both laugh]
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
[Chuckles]
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
?
I love New York...
- I love it!
- ?
New York
?
I love New York
?
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[Snoring]
[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[Woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.

I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
[Man speaks German]
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[Whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[Camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [Thurman] To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- [Thurman] Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.
Thank you.
[Shrieks]
[Woman] Oh, God.

[Gupta] I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.
[Music plays]
Excuse me, buddy.
What's going on?
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.

Crisis in Krakozhia."
Now that heavy fighting has subsided and both sides have dug in for the long winter ahead, it's clear that the future of Krakozhia may be in doubt for some time to come.
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia suffer the consequences.

Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[Chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
[Shrieks]
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
[Country music plays]

It's a man of misery.
Misery?

So, I grab.
I come.
[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [Laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...

- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counselling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[Sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[Laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...

I hate it when they delay flights.

I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?

Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?

I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.

Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
- [Enrique] We have a question for you.
- [Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
- [Viktor] This?
- [Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[All laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.

[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favourites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumour has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[Pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase Licence.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[Whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[Chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the licence.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[Man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[Sighs]
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[Cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[Clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[Pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [Pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [Pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[Both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[Camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[Cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[Footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian]
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [Bleats] - [All bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
[All cheer]
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
[Tannoy] Your attention please.
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.
[Tannoy:
Repeats message in French]
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm... [sighs]
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.
[Sighs]
There's something you should know.
[Whistles]
[Tannoy] Ladies and gentlemen, United Airlines Flight 865 from Krakozhia has landed and is now taxiing to the gate.
For those passengers holding tickets for Flight 866 to Krakozhia, we expect departure to be on schedule.
[Officer] Get back, please.
Gupta.
Gupta!
[Siren]
I am going home.
Get lost.
[Tannoy] Your attention, please.
Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be delayed until further notice.
[Guns cock]
Do you have an appointment?
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on down there!
We're right behind you.
Viktor's leaving.
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know.
He's going home.
He's going for the front door, out to the city.
What?
Viktor.
Remember us.
From the Discovery Store, I want to give you this.
It's good luck.
A digital camera for cousin Katia.
I don't know where you're going, but these will keep your feet warm.
- Everybody in position?
- [Thurman] We're here.
Secure the door.
[All talk at once]
[Waylin] Sorry, Viktor.
Take him, Judge.
Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.
You see those doors?
Those are the entry doors to New York City.
To the United States of America.
Turn around.
It's snowing in the city and you're going to need that.
Good luck.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
No, no.
I'm going to miss you.
Try not to get stuck wherever you're going.

I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.

OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.

Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.

Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.

Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.

At 1 2 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.

Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.

Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
Damn.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Don't be hurt.

I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...

I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.

This is my problem.

Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.
- How's it going?
- Good.
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
OK.
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- It's no one.
There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
OK.
Just bring it.
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
I have two nines and two nines.
Four nines.
Thank you.
- Careful.
- Watch out.
- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.
What is in the can?
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.
We know there's no nuts in there.
What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
"You can't.
That is mine. "
"You can get so confused. "
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1 200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$1 9 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.1 2.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.1 2 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
Viktor.
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down!
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today. "
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.

Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $1 49.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1 7 42 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
But the town bakers...
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 1 8 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
Then what are you waiting for?
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 1 3 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
Come on.
Oh...
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.

So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
...the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.

- No, I confused about everything.

Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
...rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1 979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
Your attention please.
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm...
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.
There's something you should know.
Ladies and gentlemen, United Airlines Flight 865 from Krakozhia has landed and is now taxiing to the gate.
For those passengers holding tickets for Flight 866 to Krakozhia, we expect departure to be on schedule.
Get back, please.
Gupta.

I am going home.
Get lost.
Your attention, please.
Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be delayed until further notice.
Do you have an appointment?
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on down there!
We're right behind you.
Viktor's leaving.
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.

He's going home.
He's going for the front door, out to the city.

From the Discovery Store, I want to give you this.
It's good luck.

I don't know where you're going, but these will keep your feet warm.
- Everybody in position?

Secure the door.
Sorry, Viktor.
Take him, Judge.
Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.
You see those doors?
Those are the entry doors to New York City.

Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the U.S.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air, there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia!
Krakozhia.
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Let me...
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
- Krakozhia.
Yes.
Okay.
- Krakozhia.
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
Okay?
No more Krakozhia.
Okay?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently, you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the U.S. recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply...
- ...unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically, it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.

Okay, Mr. Navorski, come here.

Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the U.S. and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.

Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.

United Airlines, final boarding call...
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
Okay.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.

There he is.
Okay.

What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.

He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.

Excuse me.

He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.

A flight attendant.

She look like a Russian.

She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?

Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
Asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mmm-hmm.
Fear.
- From what?
- That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question.
If you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- (LAUGHS) Okay.
- FRANK:
Okay.
THURMAN:
Okay.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
Okay.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
- You're afraid of Krakozhia.
- Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.

Okay.

I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.

I start to think that maybe, maybe this could happen.

I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, okay.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
- Tell me about it.
- Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap and usually about men killing each other.
Like 1,200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this.
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
I can't believe it.

The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
Okay?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
Well, what about a federal prison?
Well, what about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger... to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?

This why he go to Canada.

He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.

I not understand "goat."
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"
sound like "goat."
I make mistake.
(CHUCKLES)
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
(SPEAKS BULGARIAN)
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
Okay.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine... (VIKTOR SPEAKS BULGARIAN)
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
GUPTA:
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
(SIGHS)
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle sailfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the U.S.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside, and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- Okay, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
MULROY:
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- VIKTOR:
Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said okay.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying, and I'm paying him, and I'm paying him, and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
WOMAN: (ON P.A.) United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome, Italy, is now arriving at Gate C43.
(CART BEEPS)
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out.
(VIKTOR GRUNTS)
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- AMELIA:
Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- Okay.
It's 1742, and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- (PAGER BEEPS)
Sorry.
(CLATTERING)
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city, and my pager goes off during dinner.
(PAGER BEEPS)
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- (PAGER VIBRATES)
I'm so sorry.
VIKTOR:
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- (PAGER BEEPS)
Is okay.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
- You sure?
- More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
(BOTH LAUGH)
VIKTOR:
So, when do you come back?
AMELIA: 13 days.
How about you?
VIKTOR:
I will be here.
AMELIA:
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
VIKTOR:
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
(CAMERA WHIRS)
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
(CHEERING)
(VIKTOR CHUCKLES)
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
FRANK:
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one, and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of dry roasted peanuts in his bag?
- So?
- What do you make of that?
(AMELIA CHUCKLES)
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
- Has he told you why he's in New York?
- No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's okay, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So, what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
(VIKTOR STRAINS)
VIKTOR:
Come on.
Oh... (SPEAKS BULGARIAN) it no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper, 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait."
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
The right wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... (ALL SING THE KRAKOZHIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM IN BULGARIAN)
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat."

- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
(ALL CHEER)
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny."
Destiny.
WOMAN: (ON TV) ...rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.

I missed you.
Come on.
TORRES:
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Dolores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable."
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Okay.
Good.
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.

Mr Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all travelling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.

- Actually, I bought her yesterday.
Come on.
Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
- Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
[Both laugh]
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
[Chuckles]
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
?
I love New York...
- I love it!
- ?
New York
?
I love New York
?
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[Snoring]
[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[Woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
[Man speaks German]
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[Whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[Camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [Thurman] To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- [Thurman] Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.
Thank you.

[Gupta] I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.
[Music plays]
Excuse me, buddy.
What's going on?
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.

Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[Chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
[Shrieks]
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.

[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [Laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.

- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?

Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.

You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counselling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[Sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[Laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...

I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.

[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favourites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumour has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[Pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase Licence.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[Whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[Chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the licence.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[Man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[Sighs]
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[Cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[Clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[Pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [Pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [Pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[Both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[Camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[Cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[Footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian]
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [Bleats] - [All bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
[All cheer]
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
[Tannoy] Your attention please.
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.
[Tannoy:
Repeats message in French]
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm... [sighs]
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.
[Sighs]
There's something you should know.
[Whistles]
[Tannoy] Ladies and gentlemen, United Airlines Flight 865 from Krakozhia has landed and is now taxiing to the gate.
For those passengers holding tickets for Flight 866 to Krakozhia, we expect departure to be on schedule.
[Officer] Get back, please.
Gupta.
Gupta!
[Siren]
I am going home.
Get lost.
[Tannoy] Your attention, please.
Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be delayed until further notice.
[Guns cock]
Do you have an appointment?
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on down there!
We're right behind you.
Viktor's leaving.
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know.
He's going home.
He's going for the front door, out to the city.
What?

Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
[Dixon laughs]
- Thank you.
- OK.

I'm going to need you to look at me.
Beyond those doors is American soil.
Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear that you are not to enter through those doors.
You are not to leave this building.
America is closed.

There's only one thing you can do here, Mr. Navorski.

Come on.
Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
- Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
[Both laugh]
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?

I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr. Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
# I love New York...
- I love it!
- # New York
# I love New York
# I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[Snoring]
[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[Woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.

I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
[Man speaks German]
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[Whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[Camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [Thurman] To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- [Thurman] Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.

What are you looking at?
Go back to work.

He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[Chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
[Shrieks]
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.

Started beeping.
So, I grab.
I come.
[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [Laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[Sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[Laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English...
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I...
I can't go out... with you.
God.
I am so...
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.
Wet floor.
Wet floor.
- [Viktor] I...
- [Amelia] You don't have to explain.
No, I...
Please, I...

I don't know.
Maybe 15 bucks.
- Dollars?

Two people, 40.
Two people, 40 dollars.
Two people, 40 dollars.

I'm so sorry, sir.
The position has already been filled.
- Do you live nearby?
- Yes.
Gate 67.
Because we are very particular about punctual...
Did you say Gate 67?
Gate 67.
[Laughs]
You got to be kidding.
You got to help me help you.
I don't see a Social Security number mailing address, even a phone number.
Telephone?
You need?
I get.
I get.
I get phone.

All right.
When's the best time to reach you?

[Phone rings]
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Navorski.
Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.
- How's it going?
- Good.
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
[Cliff] OK.
[Woman screams]
[Shrieks]
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- [Worker] It's no one.
[Worker] There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- [Viktor] I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
[Jazz plays on personal stereo]
[Enrique] We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
[Gupta] OK.
Just bring it.
- [Enrique] Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
- [Enrique] We have a question for you.
- [Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
- [Viktor] This?
- [Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[All laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or?
I wait.
[Pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[Whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[Chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[Man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[Sighs]
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[Cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[Clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[Pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [Pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [Pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[Both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[Camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[Cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.

Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.

He say he look at photograph for seven days.

After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [Bleats] - [All bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.

But you didn't understand.

- No, I confused about everything.

Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.

To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.

Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.

- You've earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.
- You have.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.
Come on.
Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
- Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
[both laugh]
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
[chuckles]
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr. Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
[speaks Bulgarian]
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
# I love New York...
- I love it!
- # New York
# I love New York
# I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[snoring] [frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
[man speaks German] [speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [thurman] To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- [thurman] Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.
Thank you.

The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
[shrieks]
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
[country music plays]

- Honey!
Put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down.

Next.
Officer Torres.
Have you been ever in the love?
Enough, Viktor.
Who is it?
Who's telling you to ask me these things?
It's a man of misery.
Misery?
- Mystery?
- No, no.
Misery.
Man of misery.
He's so sick.
He's so in love.
But what did she say?
She did say, "Next!

And now she say, "Please.

Viktor.
Viktor, just tell me more.
I coming.
I coming.
Please, please.
[beeping, clunk]
[Viktor] Beeper went off.
Started beeping.
So, I grab.
I come.
[frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English...
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I...
I can't go out... with you.
God.
I am so...
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.
Wet floor.
Wet floor.

No, I...
Please, I...

You got to be kidding.
You got to help me help you.

Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.

- Good.
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?

- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
[cliff] OK.
[woman screams]
[shrieks]
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- [worker] It's no one.
[worker] There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- [Viktor] I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
[jazz plays on personal stereo]
[Enrique] We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
[Gupta] OK.
Just bring it.
- [Enrique] Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
- [Enrique] We have a question for you.
- [Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
- [Viktor] This?
- [Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[all laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or?
I wait.
[Pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[speaks Bulgarian]
[speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[speaks Bulgarian] [woman] Send him down!
[milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[sighs]
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?

Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[Pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [Pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [Pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[camera whirs]
[bobby] What's he doing?
[karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian]
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [bleats] - [all bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.

It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.

Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.

You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.

But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.

Why don't you fight?

I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.

I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr. Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
I love New York...
- I love it!
- New York
I love New York
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
- This belong you?
- Thank you.
Oh, shit.
See?
Wet floor.
That you.
I'm so late.
Buenos Aires.
I can't remember the gate.
Gate 24.
- You sure?
- Yes.
Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Wait.
For you.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Sensible heels.
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.
I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.
Excuse me, buddy.
What's going on?
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your order?
Keep the change.
Excuse me.
OK, go.
Go.
Good boy.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your...
"Crisis.
Crisis in Krakozhia."
"Crisis.
Crisis in Krakozhia."
Now that heavy fighting has subsided and both sides have dug in for the long winter ahead, it's clear that the future of Krakozhia may be in doubt for some time to come.
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia suffer the consequences.
"And food... in..."

"...in Krakozhia."
"The story of Broadway is the..."

"Korean conjoined twins separated today in Maine."
"Chances of survival 50-50."
50-50.
Next.
Let me ask you something, Mr. Navorski.
Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
- Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!
Put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down.
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.

I coming.
Please, please.
Beeper went off.
Started beeping.
So, I grab.
I come.
We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English...
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I...
I can't go out... with you.
God.

I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.

It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.

Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
OK.
Who is this?

There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
OK.
Just bring it.

- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
I have two nines and two nines.
Four nines.
Thank you.
- Careful.
- Watch out.
- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.
What is in the can?
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.
We know there's no nuts in there.
What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
United Airlines flight number 80 1 to Narita
United Airlines flight number 80 1 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
"You can't.
That is mine."
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down!
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
Come on.
Oh...
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
...the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
...reijoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
Your attention please.
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm...
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.

Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.

Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
I love it!
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.

Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.

- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.

Here we go.
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.

He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.

Excuse me.
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.

He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.

We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
Damn.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
SouthAfricanAirlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.

You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.

Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.

Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.

Thank you.

- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.
What is in the can?
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.
We know there's no nuts in there.
What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.

I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?

So, will we share the panties?

- Come on.
- Wait a second.
UnitedAirlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
"You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or?
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
Viktor.
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down!
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
Therewasa20man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.

Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
UnitedAirlinesFlight2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
But the town bakers...
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
Then what are you waiting for?
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
Inmylineofwork , there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
Come on.
Oh...
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
Yourattentionplease.
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm...
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.
There's something you should know.

I don't know where you're going, but these will keep your feet warm.
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.
Secure the door.
Sorry, Viktor.
Take him, Judge.
Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.
You see those doors?
Those are the entry doors to New York City.
To the United States of America.
Turn around.
It's snowing in the city and you're going to need that.
Good luck.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

Try not to get stuck wherever you're going.

Yeah.
Yes, I am.
Benny Golson, I am Viktor Navorski.
I am from Krakozhia.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, was great, great fan of your music.
A jazz fan.
Fantastic.
Would you sign your name, please?
Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.
- Just a minute.

All right, Mr. Navorski, we'd like you to wait here, please.

[Thurman] What are you doing in the United States, Mr. Navorski?
[thick Bulgarian accent] Yellow taxicab, please.
Take me to Ramada Inn, 161 Lexington.
Staying at the Ramada Inn?
Keep the change.
Do you know anyone in New York?

161 Lexington.
OK, Mr. Navorski, I need to see your return ticket, please.
No, your return ticket.
Your...
- Oh...
Yes.
- Ah.
[woman screams]
This is just a standard procedure.
I'm going to need the passport also.
Oh...
OK.
- No, no.
- Thank you.
Mr. Navorski.
That.
Passport.
That.
Mr. Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
[Dixon laughs]
- Thank you.
- OK.
All right.
Thanks, Judge.

You must keep this with you at all times.
Here is an ID badge for you to get into CBP.
Beyond those doors...

I'm going to need you to look at me.
Beyond those doors is American soil.
Mr. Dixon wants me to make it clear that you are not to enter through those doors.
You are not to leave this building.
America is closed.
America closed.
What I do?
There's only one thing you can do here, Mr. Navorski.

- You've earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.
- You have.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.
Come on.
Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
- Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
[both laugh]
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
[chuckles]
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr. Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
[speaks Bulgarian]
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
I love New York...
- I love it!
- New York
I love New York
I love New York...
Light green.
Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[snoring]
[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
[man speaks German] [speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr. Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [Thurman] To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- [Thurman] Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.

The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

Excuse me, buddy.
What's going on?
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.

Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
[shrieks]
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
[country music plays]

So, I grab.

[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.

- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...

Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...

I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.

It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.
- How's it going?
- Good.
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
[Cliff] OK.
[woman screams]
[shrieks]
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- [worker] It's no one.
[worker] There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- [Viktor] I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
[jazz plays on personal stereo]
[Enrique] We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
[Gupta] OK.
Just bring it.
- [Enrique] Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
- [Enrique] We have a question for you.
- [Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
- [Viktor] This?
- [Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[all laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 80 1 to Narita
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 80 1 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- l don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah. I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1 200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs] I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick. I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[pager beeps]
- lt's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- l have to go.
- l have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The fbi and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$1 9 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.1 2.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the fbi?
- l tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- lt'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.1 2 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- l have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh... I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- l help you?
Why?
- l don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green. I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[speaks Bulgarian]
[speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know. I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[speaks Bulgarian] [woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat. lt medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- lt's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- lt doesn't look good, Frank.
- l was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up. lt's not over yet.
[sighs]
- ls that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No. I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- l do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.

Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No. I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
No, no, no. lt's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]

- Hello.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- l'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $1 49.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1 7 42 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind. lt's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
is histories. ls truth.
- l'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 1 8 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [pager vibrates] I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- l live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- l don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [pager beeps]
is OK. I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 1 3 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No. I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 1 3 days from now.
[camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him. I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me. lt will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- l have to work.
- He will wait.
[cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- ls something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles] I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia. I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- l did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- l...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free. I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian] lt no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here. I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1 958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You. I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
...the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [bleats] - [all bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.

It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- l go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
[all cheer]
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- l think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry. I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
...reijoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no. lt's not signed.

This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah. I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.

Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- l told you this is over.
- l go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1 979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- l'm sorry.
What did you say?
- l will go home.
Leave them alone. I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.

- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.

You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?

Now, E...
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
Do...
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
OK....
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
Ok...
Good, I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk, I've a bit of bad news.
Its seems your country has suspended all travelling privileges on passports that been issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
Anyway it seems while you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Now most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
There were a terribale fire....
They got it all on GHN, I think. anyway.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
So all the flights in and out of your country have been suspended indefinitly.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your passport or visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, even we could prepare your papers, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
So see...
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel or diplomatic visa.
You don't qualify for any of these things.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
Well, I got more bad news for you.
Mr Navorsky, Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Did you see that show over there?
Talking Tina, Nightmare of 9000 feet, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important. anyway...
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr Navorski, walk with me.
Here's my dilemma, Mr Navorski.
You no right to enter the United States and I've no legal right to detain you.
Its seems you have fallen through a small crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
So until we get this sorted out,
I have no choice but to allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge. alright?
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like within the confines the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
I'm sure that Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.

Congratulations!
Frank, I'm nominating you to take my place.

You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why the hell, doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?

- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.

No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr Navorski.
Catch and release Judge.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him very carefully and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.

Then he's somebody else's problem.
Sir, why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
And then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving this terminal.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like Victor Navorsky.

No food.

OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr Navorski, I have some very very good news for you.
What?
I've figured I figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
Right, You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people...
They never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
Well, That's the best part.
It doesn't really matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
OK?
So I'm going to ask you one question, Victor.
It's a simple question.
And if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [Laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
Victor.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible horrible..
And God only knows what could happen.
Right?
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
and trough on the jail.
- On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
- Yes all right.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, No, No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
Ok, I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
I'm talking about human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.

I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?

- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.

- Will you feel better if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.

So you are clean.

Let's play cards.

[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please please please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I got say, I am so sorry about what happened last time, you know, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I finally meet somebody keeps his hands in his packet, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap and usually about man killing each other.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favourites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yeah.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumour has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
Victor, I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I was ...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[Pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Ooh, Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport at 9 am, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
I believe they're paying him cash under the table Sir.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him, look at him, look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
So, Automativally he's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
So I only asking you for to put him in a federal detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no goddamn room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- Yes, I try the FBI, I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to business to Brazil, She make me sure to bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his wedding ring?
And if he's divorced, to a right mind, why still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- So It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- He's from Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to this guy.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Krakozhian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives cross the border from you.
He may not speak exactly your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out of jail.
- I help you?
Why?
- Because I don't want anybody to get hurt Victor.
This guy's very upset.
Just talk to him to calm him down, you do that and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes. yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
stay out!
Mr. Milodragovich We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!

[Speaks Krakozhian]
[Speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, he need to have a Medicinal Purchase Licence.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[Speaks Krakozhian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada. this why the Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter , It doesn't matter.
Plane landed in the United States.
He needs to have the right form.
[Speaks Krakozhian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the local hospital who is treating his father, and the docter in Canada.
These medicines have to stay in the United States now to care.
They have to stay here.
[Speaks Krakozhian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I can see that.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[Speaks Krakozhian]
[Woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa. whoa. whoa.

It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes, yes.

You misunderstood him?
- The medicine not for his dying father?
- No.

I make mistake.
[Chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You've been read the immigration form.
The blue one.
- Blue?
- Yeah.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the medicinal purchase licence.
You know it, then he can bring the drugs in.
That's very good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[Speaks Krakozhian]
Answer him, Mr Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Medicine For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Krakozhian]
[Man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think it's a game?
Han?
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for another five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States of America. and...
Then you'll know why the fight over of people of Krakozhia wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules, Know the numbers and concentrate on the people.
The people, Yeah, I know.
The people, compassion.
Frank That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[Sighs]
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.

Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?

- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the United State.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No. no. no.
I can't do this.
- Victor, You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- OK, What's her name?

So we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
You better be careful.

Why you think we can stop for a smile.

Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I just run away.
So you never go home?
Ahh, If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome, Italy is now arriving at Gate C43.
[Cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[Clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but... no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[Pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
So that's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [Pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- No no no, I don't wait for flight and I don't wait for meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [Pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What, what what you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Victor.
Ready?
[Both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
O Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[Camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
I promise you'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[Cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us, mom.
You're got been kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of plant's Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[Footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was the gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, New York, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here all this times so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Krakozhian]
All right, all right, all right, everybody.
Come on, Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".

But you didn't understand.

- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
At the distane of Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...

Yeah.

Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.

It's time for you to go home.

- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job as field commisioner is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
Joe's been here for about 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has turn out has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But it has turn out he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.

Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all travelling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.

We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
[Chuckles]
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
# I love New York...
- I love it!
- # New York
# I love New York
# I love New York...
Light green.
Mr Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[Snoring]
[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[Woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
[Man speaks German]
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[Whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[Camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [Thurman] To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- [Thurman] Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.
Thank you.
[Shrieks]
[Woman] Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
- This belong you?
- Thank you.
Oh, shit.
See?
Wet floor.
That you.
I'm so late.

- Yes.
Thanks.
[Tannoy] Ladies and gentlemen...
Wait.
For you.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Sensible heels.
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you.
[Gupta] I think he's CIA.
The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.
[Music plays]
Excuse me, buddy.
What's going on?
It's Navorski.
He's figured out the quarters.
[Coins jangle]
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your order?
Keep the change.
Excuse me.
OK, go.
Go.
Good boy.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Welcome to Burger King.
May I take your...

Crisis.
Crisis in Krakozhia.
Now that heavy fighting has subsided and both sides have dug in for the long winter ahead, it's clear that the future of Krakozhia may be in doubt for some time to come.
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia suffer the consequences.
And food... in have caused food and energy shortages.

Chances of survival 50-50.
50-50.
Next.
Let me ask you something, Mr Navorski.
Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[Chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
[Shrieks]
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
[Country music plays]
- [Max] Sorry, buddy.
- Honey!
Put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down.
You try to take my mop.
You try to take my floor.
It's my job.

She won't take your chitting.
Next.
Officer Torres.
Have you been ever in the love?
Enough, Viktor.
Who is it?
Who's telling you to ask me these things?
It's a man of misery.
Misery?
- Mystery?
- No, no.
Misery.
Man of misery.
He's so sick.
He's so in love.
But what did she say?
She did say, Next!
Next!
And now she say, Please.
Please come.

Viktor.
Viktor, just tell me more.

I coming.
Please, please.
[Beeping, clunk]
[Viktor] Beeper went off.
Started beeping.
So, I grab.
I come.
[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [Laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
[Amelia] A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
[Amelia sobs]
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counselling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[Sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[Laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's BH?
In English...
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I...
I can't go out... with you.
God.
I am so...
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.

Wet floor.
Wet floor.

No, I...

[Shrieks]
Who is this?
- Who are you?

[Worker] There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- [Viktor] I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
[Jazz plays on personal stereo]
[Enrique] We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
[Gupta] OK.
Just bring it.
- [Enrique] Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
- [Enrique] We have a question for you.
- [Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
- [Viktor] This?
- [Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[All laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] You can't.
That is mine.
You can get so confused.
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favourites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumour has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[Pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase Licence.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[Whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand goat.
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for father... sound like goat.
I make mistake.
[Chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the licence.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[Man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
Put the guns away, the man say.
Nobody will die today.
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor The Goat Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[Sighs]
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[Cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[Clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[Pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[Both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[Camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[Cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[Footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian]
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, Yes, yes.
We all wait.
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor The Goat.
- [Bleats] - [All bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
[All cheer]
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
Destiny.
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more unacceptable.
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
[Tannoy] Your attention please.

- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm... [sighs]

Mr Navorski.
That.
Passport.
That.
Mr Navorski?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all travelling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
OK.
OK.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- I am crack.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.
- Free?
- Free.
Free.
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
[Dixon laughs]
- Thank you.
- OK.
All right.
Thanks, Judge.

You are not to leave this building.
America is closed.
America closed.
What I do?
There's only one thing you can do here, Mr Navorski.

- Actually, I bought her yesterday.
Come on.
Congratulations!
I'm nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don't know what to say.
- Jesus.
Richard, is this real?
- It's real, Frank, it's real.
Don't pretend to be surprised.
You've been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven't been waiting for you to retire.
[Both laugh]
That's all right, Frank.
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You've waited a long time for this.
- I have.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I will.
I've been here for 17 years...
We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
[Chuckles]
I'm saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let's go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
Mr Thurman.
There's a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
Next!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
I need visa.
Where's your green form?
I can't do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Next!
Sir.
The light green form.
# I love New York...
- I love it!
- # New York
# I love New York
# I love New York...
Light green.
Mr Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
[Snoring]
[Frank] Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
[Woman] Next!
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I'll show him the door.
Hello.
Hello.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes. 9.30.
Food document, trash.

I hate the Tuesday.
Excuse me.
[Man speaks German]
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Airports are tricky places, Mr Navorski.
I'm about to tell you something.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It's a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o'clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.
Johnson, clear the doors.
All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.
All right.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that's not him.
There he is.
All right, Viktor.
Here we go.
[Whistle]
What's so complicated?
Exit, Viktor.
Come on.
In a few minutes, you'll be somebody else's problem.
He wants to make sure nobody's watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He's on his way.
Excuse me.
[Camera whirs]
You got it.
There we go.
He's got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
Is he praying?
No.
He's tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Get the cameras.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [Thurman] To the left of here.
- No.
He was at the door.
- [Thurman] Just go a little left.
- All right.
All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Go back to work.
Thank you.

The CIA put him here to spy on us.
You don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't speak English.
If he could learn to speak, this guy.
He can't speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she's CIA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
KGB.
She gave him heel of her shoes.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I'm warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.

Why do you wait here every day when there's nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
You have two stamp.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50-50.
[Chuckles]
Yes.
That's a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn't work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I've created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?

Thank you.
I'll take it from here.
I'm Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No carts, no quarters.
No quarters, no food.
It'll be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2.14
Then he's somebody else's problem.
Why don't we tag him in violation of section 2.14 now?
Then ship him to detention.
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won't lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.

[Frank] We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [Laughs] OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?

OK.

- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Damn.
- [Gupta laughs]
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.

That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Tannoy] South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.

Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.

I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counselling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
[Sobs]
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
[Laughs]
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...

Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...

6.30, yes...
Boss.
[Jazz plays on personal stereo]
[Enrique] We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
[Gupta] OK.
Just bring it.
- [Enrique] Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
[Viktor] I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor] Four nines.
Thank you.
- [Enrique] Careful.
- [Mulroy] Watch out.
- [Enrique] We have a question for you.
- [Mulroy] Yeah, we're just curious.
[Gupta] What is in the can?
- [Viktor] This?
- [Mulroy] We saw the x-ray.
[Gupta] We know there's no nuts in there.
[Viktor] What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
[All laugh]
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
[Tannoy] United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
[Viktor] "You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
[Amelia] Viktor?
[Amelia] Well, hi.
[Viktor] Please.
- [Amelia] How are you?
- [Viktor] Good.
[Amelia] Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favourites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumour has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
[Amelia laughs]
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
[Pager beeps]
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
[Thurman] Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
[Frank] We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
- [Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Speaks Russian]
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase Licence.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
[Woman] Send him down!
[Milodragovich sobs]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
[Whimpers]
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
[Chuckles]
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the licence.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Answer him, Mr Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
[Viktor speaks Bulgarian]
[Man] Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
[Gupta] There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
[Sighs]
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
[Tannoy] United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
[Cart beeps]
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
[Viktor grunts]
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- [Amelia] What time?
- [Viktor] Dinnertime.
- [Amelia] Where do you want to go?
- [Viktor] I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
[Clattering]
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
[Pager beeps]
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
- [pager vibrates]
I'm so sorry.
[Viktor] I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
- [pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
[Both laugh]
[Viktor] So, when do you come back?
[Amelia] 13 days.
How about you?
[Viktor] I will be here.
[Amelia] But what if your schedule changes?
[Amelia] Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
[Viktor] No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
[Camera whirs]
[Bobby] What's he doing?
[Karl] I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
[Enrique speaks Spanish]
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[Cheering]
[Viktor chuckles]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
[Frank] In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
[Amelia chuckles]
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
[Footsteps]
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
[Viktor strains]
[Viktor] Come on.
Oh... [speaks Bulgarian]
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
[Amelia] Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [Bleats] - [All bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha...
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
[All cheer]
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused...
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
... rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power...
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.

I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er...
Let me...
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er...
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
...Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
No, Mr. Navorski.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can't allow you to go home either.
You don't really have a home.
Technically it doesn't exist.
It's like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?

Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.

You have fallen through a crack in the system.

Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.

We're talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.

Mr. Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There's nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I'm sorry, but you've wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
- Yes.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
You put him there.
Why doesn't he walk out the doors?
Why doesn't he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn't think he'd actually do it.
I mean, he's in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
Yeah, it could be a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.

Do you understand?
It's a secret.

At 12 o'clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
Yes.
Late five minutes.

Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
No.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr. Navorski.
Catch and release.
It's simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You unhook him and place him back in the water.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Call them off.

All right.
Go.
Get out of there.
All right, there's the door.

We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
Damn.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
South African Airlines passenger Sharif Al-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know...
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe...
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh...
You headed for home?
Er...
No, no.
I am...
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English...
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm...
No, I...
I can't.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- No.
I...
I can't go out... with you.
God.
I am so...
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.
- I didn't want to eat alone.
Wet floor.
Wet floor.
- I...
- You don't have to explain.
No, I...
Please, I...
Wheelchair to gate A-five.
Nadia.
In New York restaurant, what cost is cantaloni?
I don't know.
Maybe 15 bucks.
- Dollars?

Two people, 40.
Two people, 40 dollars.
Two people, 40 dollars.

I'm so sorry, sir.
The position has already been filled.
- Do you live nearby?
- Yes.
Gate 67.
Because we are very particular about punctual...
Did you say Gate 67?
Gate 67.
You got to be kidding.
You got to help me help you.
I don't see a Social Security number mailing address, even a phone number.
Telephone?
You need?
I get.
I get.
I get phone.
I get...
I get phone.
451-1226.
All right.
When's the best time to reach you?
Now?
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Navorski.
Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
Who calls?
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.
- How's it going?
- Good.
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
OK.
Who is this?
- Who are you?
- It's no one.
There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours...
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes...
Boss.
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
OK.
Just bring it.
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But...
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
I have two nines and two nines.
Four nines.
Thank you.
- Careful.
- Watch out.
- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.
What is in the can?
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.
We know there's no nuts in there.
What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in...
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
"You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so...
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or?
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm...
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No offence to mother-in-laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons...
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
Viktor.
Oh...
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He...
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down!
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The...
Krakozhia...
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine...
Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For...
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Eat to bite.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat...
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
It's wet.
- Hey.
- Watch where you're going.
Watch out!
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99.
That's a bargain.
- Napoleon?
- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Sorry.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Cannelloni.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Same.
- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- But the town bakers...
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
- Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
- Then what are you waiting for?
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I...
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
Come on.
Oh...

Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.

My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
... the right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin...
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
May he never lose his country again.

Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newlywed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.

I'm Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We're looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk.
I've a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all traveling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That's it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They were attacked in the middle of the night.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
I'm sure your family's fine.
Mr. Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
- Right.
I don't think he gets it.
Er..
Let me..
OK.
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra-kozhia.
- Kra-kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
- OK.
Er..
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple..
- Big Apple.
Big Apple.
Big Apple represents the Liberty Rebels.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
Revolution.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa's no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can't process you new papers until the US recognizes your country's new diplomatic reclassification.
You don't qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non-immigration work travel.
You don't qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply..
unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.

Technically it doesn't exist.

Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
Really?
It's not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr. Navorski, come here.
Here's my dilemma, Mr. Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.

Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
I'm going to sign a release form that is going to make you a free man.

I come.
We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No.
No food.
I stuffed.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr. Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
What?
I've figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm-hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you'd get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It's the law.
You'd be released.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
- Uh-huh.
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm-hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That's the best part.
It doesn't matter what you're afraid of.
It's all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I'm going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
So, I answer one question.
Go to New York City.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- OK.
- OK.
All right.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
OK.
Let me try it again.
- Your country's at war.
- Yes.
War.
There are men in the streets with guns.
Political persecution.
- Yes.
It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you're afraid.
- From what?
- Krakozhia.
You're afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I'm a little afraid of this room.
I'm talking about bombs.
I'm talking about human dignity.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don't be afraid to tell me you're afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
- No?
OK.
- I'm afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- I'm afraid from Dracula.
- Thanks a lot.
I'm afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
Damn.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That's why I'm not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back-to-back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you're going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don't lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
South African Airlines passenger Sharif AI-Calala, please come to the main ticket counter.
You make a habit out of listening to other people's conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then..
- You know why men are such assholes?
- No.
Because they're all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Please.
Don't be hurt.
How can I not be?
He's married.
One man.
Two womens.
Crowded.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counseling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I'm rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn't so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye-bye.
You know..
sometimes in the mornings,
I just stare at him over room service.
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe..
maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This.. man.. has you.
Why he need.. puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Sensible heels.
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
Oh..
You headed for home?
Er..
No, no.
I am..
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What's "BH"?
In English..
Viktor Navorski.

- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it's late and you've probably got other plans, but if you'd like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
Erm..

Who calls?
It's Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Cliff.
Hello.

- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position's been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That'd be good.
- All right.
- Thank you.
OK.
Who is this?

- It's no one.
There's no one here for two weeks.
This isn't one of my guys.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry's crew.
You with Harry's crew?
Does Harry think he's running this job?
- I go now.
- Go?
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We're ten months away from 67.
He's got to be Harry's.
If he's not mine and he's not yours..
Harry's trying to make me look bad.
I've got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What's your name?
- Viktor Navorski.
Pull him off Harry's crew, put him on mine.
You start 6.30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6.30, yes..
Boss.
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
OK.
Just bring it.
- Hey, Viktor.
- Hello, all.
Look.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I'm not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn't a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A wire in his shirt.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I'm not going to lose my job.
- Fine.
- What if we x-rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
- OK.
So you are clean.
- Good.
Let's play cards.
I will have money.
But..
Friday.
Don't worry about it.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You'll be amazed at what people leave at airports.
Come.
I have two nines and two nines.
Four nines.
Thank you.
- Careful.
- Watch out.
- We have a question for you.
- Yeah, we're just curious.
What is in the can?
- This?
- We saw the x-ray.
We know there's no nuts in there.
What is in there?
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
- Yes.
You sure it's jazz in there?
It might be the blues.
- Or salsa.
- Maybe it's Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
- OK, guys.
OK.
For tonight's grand prize, we have..
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
There you go.
And.. they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
As in..
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
I checked it out.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher's panties.
- Ready?
- Hurry up.
So, will we share the panties?
- No, no, no.
- Not if I win.
- Come on.
- Wait a second.
United Airlines flight number 801 to Narita is now announcing final boarding.
"You can't.
That is mine."
"You can get so confused."
Viktor?
Well, hi.
Please.
- How are you?
- Good.
Man.
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30,000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn't, I don't know how to react.
- Let's just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don't know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
Napoleon?
Yeah.
I read a lot of history books.
They're long and cheap.
Like 1200 pages for $9.99.
You can't beat that.
- But Napoleon?
- Yeah.
He's one of my favorites.
- You know what saved Napoleon's life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
After he loses the Battle of Waterloo,
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He's very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn't die.
See?
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
- Yes.
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It's funny you should say that.
Rumor has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we're rewriting history right here.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
I'm so..
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I'm sick.
I don't have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, What?
- OK.
Lunch.. with you.
- You'll have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You're not running for a flight or..?
I wait.
- It's me.
- You.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I just got paged.
You work?
- No.
- Ah.
Three of you.
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I'm..
I have a serious problem.
I'm as bad as Napoleon.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You're not sick, Amelia.
No.
- No?
No.
You're a little.. farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Story of my life.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection's in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much does he make?
How much are they paying him?
They're paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that's more than I make?
That's New York City construction.
One of my own men came up to me the other day.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski's going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
OK?
No country.
He's a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2.12.
I want you to put him in a detention center and run a clearance on him.
That's all I want.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We're detaining so many people, there's no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBI?
- I tried everybody.
Nobody'll take him.
You want me to bring him back to the terminal?
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let's show them why this is the number-one airport in the United States.
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger..
to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That's a lot of walnuts.
Yeah.
My mother-in-law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother-in-law?
- Yeah.
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren't for his mother-in-law?
If he's married, where's his ring?
And if he's divorced, who still talks to their mother-in-law?
I'm sorry, but really.
No of fence to mother-in-laws, but..
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It'll have to wait.
- No.
This won't wait.
When the 9.12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they're for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
Everybody keep your weapons..
All right.
We're here to help you.
We're here to help you, sir.
All right.
Give me the knife.
- Where's he from?
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
Viktor.
Oh..
I need your help.
His name is Nlilodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
- I help you?
Why?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This guy's very upset.
Just calm him down and I'll let you back in the terminal.
No.
New York.
No red stamp.
Green.
I green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- Yes.
- OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Stay out!
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Somebody to talk to you.
Go ahead.
Stay out!
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase License.
OK?
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn't matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He needs to have the right form.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I'm saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He..
He's begging you.
I know.
I can see that he's begging.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I'm sorry.
Send him down!
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Let's go.
Whoa.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
Goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say..
We not understand.
I not understand "goat".
Why?
What are you saying?
You misunderstood him?
- It's not for his dying father?
- No.
No.
The..
Krakozhia..
The name for "father"..
Sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for.. goat.
- No, it's not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
- Yes.
Blue.
- Blue?
- Blue.
The blue form.
The one that says if it's an animal, he doesn't need the license.
Then he can bring the drugs in.
That's good, Viktor.
That's very good.
Why are you doing this?
Huh?
You don't know him.
You don't know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him..
No, not you.
I want you to ask him.
I want to hear him say it.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Please.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr. Nlilodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
The pills stay.
He goes.
That's it.
Goat.
Please.
For goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine..
Come on now, it's all over.
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you'll know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two-ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody Will die today."
Who?
- Who was it that saved him?
- Yeah, tell us.
Who was it?
Who was this man?
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn't look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That's the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up. it's not over yet.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what's in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
You will not set one foot in New York City.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Yes.
You don't like fish.
Do you ever feel like you're just living in an airport?
We don't have to do this, Viktor.
I can ship you out in a crate.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
What about my food cart?
He can hide inside and we'll drive out.
- No.
I can't do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What's her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Be careful.
Those flight attendants ain't like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They're always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Gupta, will you relax?
Just watch the door.
You go in jail.
Not me.
For..
You know what?
Forget it.
- Keep looking.
- Warren, right?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
- Yeah.
Way to go, Viktor.
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?

Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat..
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
I said OK.
This is common.
Sol pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I'm paying him and I'm paying him and I'm paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
- No.
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
What if United States catch you?
They deport you.
As long as I keep my floor clean, keep my head down, they have no reason to deport me.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Hey, wait.

He nearly killed me.

Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149.99
That's a bargain.

- Yes, yes.
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Amelia?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Food.
Tonight?
- You're asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Yeah.
Sure.
- What time?
- Dinnertime.
- Where do you want to go?
- I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.

Thank you.
I didn't know they had a patio up here.
It's very nice.
Good night.

So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.

- That's a great, great choice.
I'll be back.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
- OK.
It's 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
But the town bakers..
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It's a dumb story.
- No, please.
I'm sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I'll bet the Romanians themselves don't give a shit.
I care.
Is histories.
Is truth.
- I'm 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- That's the truth.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I'm 33, and most of the men I've dated think I'm 27, but no.
I'm 39.
So?
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I've been doing this over 20 years.
And now there's no more pretending.
This is it.
It's why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I've been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it's coming, Viktor.
That's why I can't break it off.
That's why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
Yeah.
I've been waiting my whole life.
Just don't know what the hell for.
I'm so sorry.
I live here.
- What?
- I live here, in terminal.
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
- Yes.
Day and night.
This home, like you.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting..
- I don't wait for flight or meeting.
Then what are you waiting for?
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I'm sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
13 days.
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
No.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Come on.
Tell me.
I will show you. 13 days from now.
What's he doing?
I can't ask him.
I'm supposed to tell him what he's doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You'll get really fat with all the food I'm going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You'll have to come with us.
You're kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody.
In my line of work, there are three things that matter.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he's here and where he's from?
No.
We're just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I'd make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he's planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he's in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
- No.
We just met at the airport.
All I know is that he's a building contractor, living out of a suitcase.
That's it.
- He's a contractor?
- Yeah.
That's what he said?
Amelia.
I'm just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That's something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
Sit.
It's OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you're not very good at it.
- I did not lie.
You told me you were delayed.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- I..
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he's out of my life.
I'm free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Please.
Sit.
Please.
That was gift.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Please.
Sit.
Don't get wet.
Come on.
Oh..
It no work.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You're living here, Viktor.
You're living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
Here.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn't in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
He say he look at photograph for seven days.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday..
Who are they?
Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins,
Art Blakey, Max Kaminsky.
57 of them all together.
After looking at photograph for seven days, my father has idea.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie's Sugar Bowl.
He ask the nuns to write English.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you've been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
And I say to you, "Yes, yes.
We all wait".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.
The right-wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin..
All right, everybody.
Let's raise your glasses.
Let's have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
You here early!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
The war, peace.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- You know my friend in Washington.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It's a pass, Viktor.
A one-day travel emergency visa with your name on it.
- Wha..
Visa?
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- I go New York?
- Yes.
I go New York!
Amelia, you come with.
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn't understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
I not confused..
Not this.
Not this.
I'm sorry.
I'm running late.
Amelia.
Why you go?
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
Rejoice in the streets as well as in their local taverns.
The Krakozhian flag waved goodbye from high atop the parliament buildings.
It is a clear sign of the power..
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
I missed you.
Come on.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
Oh, no.
It's not signed.
What?
This is a one-day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
The war in my country is over.
Yeah.
I know.
Congratulations.
It's strange, isn't it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
One tiny moment.
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It's time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr. Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don't make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He's been here for 20 years, but he's been running an after-hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy's going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
Yep.
And then there's this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That's a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he's a newly Wed.
But I'm going to have to let him go.
And then there's Gupta Rajan.
He's a janitor.
But he's wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I'll have to deport him.
I will go home.
- I'm sorry.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
Leave them alone.
I will go.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don't get on that plane, they're all gone.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
OK.
Good.
Your attention please.
Immediate boarding, gate B-20, for flight number 309 Air Canada to Ottawa.
I don't believe you.
- Viktor, you don't have to do this.
- You can fight these guys.
- We'll help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We're all your friends.
We're your family now.
Gupta.
Good bye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don't you fight?
- The war is over.
- Then go.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don't have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
You make me sick!
What's wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I'm..
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.
There's something you should know.
Ladies and gentlemen, United Airlines Flight 865 from Krakozhia has landed and is now taxiing to the gate.
For those passengers holding tickets for Flight 866 to Krakozhia, we expect departure to be on schedule.
Get back, please.
Gupta.
Gupta!
I am going home.
Get lost.
Your attention, please.
Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be delayed until further notice.
Do you have an appointment?
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on down there!
We're right behind you.
Viktor's leaving.
- Monica, Viktor's leaving.
- I know.
He's going home.
He's going for the front door, out to the city.
What?
Viktor.
Remember us.
From the Discovery Store, I want to give you this.
It's good luck.
A digital camera for cousin Katia.
I don't know where you're going, but these will keep your feet warm.
- Everybody in position?
- We're here.
Secure the door.
Sorry, Viktor.
Take him, Judge.
Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.
You see those doors?
Those are the entry doors to New York City.
To the United States of America.
Turn around.
It's snowing in the city and you're going to need that.
Good luck.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
No, no.
I'm going to miss you.
Try not to get stuck wherever you're going.
Arrest him!
Arrest him!
Goddammit!
Taxi!
Thank you.
Where you go?
161 Lexington.
Please take Van Wyck Expressway to Queensboro Bridge.
It's faster than BQE
- Where you from?
- Krakozhia.
Viktor Navorski.
I'm Goran.
Albania.
- When do you come to New York?
- Thursday.
You want us to block the south exit and have AP sweep every vehicle?
Sir?
5.30 from Tokyo just landed.
Got two planes on the tarmac.
Barcelona on approach.
The night is young and 1500 people are headed our way.
Everybody inside.
Everybody inside.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
- Are you checking in, sir?
- No, no.
I don't check in.
I want to go to this place, please.
The lobby lounge is around the corner.
They have happy hour specials and live music.
Do you like jazz?
The monitor's off.
The piano's OK.
A little more bass.
More bass from the monitor.
Let's do Killer Joe.
It worked all right last night.
- Yes?
- You are Benny Golson?
Yeah.
Yes, I am.
Benny Golson, I am Viktor Navorski.
I am from Krakozhia.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, was great, great fan of your music.
A jazz fan.
Fantastic.
Would you sign your name, please?
Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.
- Just a minute.
- I will wait.
OK.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Where you want to go?
I am going home.
subtext:
NoRMITA.326
Nice of you to come.
I welcome you.
You don't look very welcoming.
I am he who was entrusted to guard this place.
For the time being, you may call me Number 48.
Number 48?
It's been so long since I was able to go against someone so capable.
You have run out of luck by coming up against me.
Do not think ill of me, kid.
And you, don't think ill of me for being the kid that defeated you.
Nice.
You move well, for being so big.
That's more like it.
Who are you!
?
I should respond, when asked who I am, huh?
My name is Number 66.
Although, that's just what they call me at work.
Number 66?
Yes.
I do have my own, proper name as well, but if you heard it, you'd be so surprised you'd wet yourself.
I'll tell you when I finish you off.
His reflexes...!
Why, you...!
What!
?
Kid...!
He has the same kind of armored body as Al!
?
Man cannot obtain anything without first sacrificing something.
In order to obtain anything, something of equal value is required.
That is alchemy's Law of Equivalent Exchange.
At the time, we believed that to be the true way of the world.
I knew it.
Just as I thought, you're hollow.
Surprising.
You've done well to realize it.
I spar against someone like you all the time.
I could tell by the way you moved.
Oh, there's someone like me in the outside world, is there?
It bugs me to think that there's some idiot besides me who thought of bonding a soul to a suit of armor.
Fascinating.
Allow me to reintroduce myself.
My "Number 48" is the label I had as a condemned prisoner.
Officially, I'm supposed to have been executed two years ago.
A condemned prisoner?
Which means that, sure enough, there's a connection between the 5th Laboratory here and the prison next door.
When I had a flesh and blood body, I was called "The Slicer".
I was a mass murderer, who caused many public disturbances.
Nowadays, my skills have been called upon, and I am the immortal watchdog over this place.
No, you're not immortal.
What?
Your bloodseal!
The iron within the blood is attuned with the metal of your armor, and that is what keeps your soul bound to this world.
If that seal is broken, you will die.
It appears that after all this time, I've met someone with a backbone.
This should prove to be an interesting fight.
Your weak spot has been exposed.
If you're going to give up, now is the time.
I don't care!
I'm the type that seeks a little tension in battle, you see...
Now then we go!
What was that?
Just now there was something strange in my shoulder...
Since it's less heavy, it's strength has dropped as well, so make sure you don't do anything reckless.
I have to finish this quickly, or I'm in trouble!
Just like a monkey, aren't you?
Hey, what did you say!
?
It's been so long since I've had such responsive prey.
I'm so happy.
However, judging by your wound and your exhaustion, the end of this battle is in sight.
As you can see, my body knows no fatigue.
Give up.
Right now, my companion is disposing of your partner outside.
You can't rely on him to help you.
Hey, is this companion of yours strong?
Yes he is, although not to the same extent as myself.
What's so funny?
In that case, I don't need to worry.
I've been fighting with him a long time, but I've never beaten him.
Why, you...!
Hold still so you can get cut up!
You miserable behemoth!
I'm going to hurt you for all you're worth!
So you tell me...
Now!
I'm taking a shoulder roast!
Now you've gone and done it.
My head fell off.
Your body...!
Yeah.
Thanks to certain circumstances, I've wound up with this body.
You can't tell who I used to be like this, can you?
You can't tell me you've forgotten.
Thanks to me getting caught by you guys, I was made a condemned criminal, after all.
Number 66 was my label on death row.
When I still had a flesh and blood body, the name people called me by was the serial killer, Barry the Chopper!
Barry the Chopper?
Barry?
You mean, from back then!
?
That's right!
After being caught and executed, I've come back from the depths of hell to take revenge against you!
You don't say.
Don't "you don't say" me!
People do get surprised when an executed prisoner is still alive, you know!
And what's more, when a suit of armor that has lost its head still moves around, you should be more like "Gyaah!" or like "Waah!" or like "What's the deal with your body!
?" or like...
Gyaah!
What's the deal with your body!
?
That's awful.
You'll hurt my feelings, you know.
Are you a fellow executed prisoner, too?
I'm no criminal!
Even so, now that I know, this fight is all mine.
I know what your weakness is!
If I destroy the bloodseal within that armor someplace, you will die.
Brace yourself!
The same goes for you too, right?
Yeah, but you don't know where my bloodseal is, do you!
?
And you don't know where mine is, do you?
At this point, I'll just have to slice you up and find out where your bloodseal is!
What's with him?
Geez...
B Block and C Block have both turned up nothing.
He must still be in the area somewhere!
Find him, whatever it takes!
Yes, sir!
He's pretty bold, to be staging an attack on a military facility like this.
Still, why is Scar so preoccupied with coming after Edward?
So then, where are the Elric brothers?
Uh, yeah, well, you see... it's like this...
You're acting suspiciously!
Major Armstrong!
With the Major's authorization, could I have the forces here relocate?
What do you mean?
The Elric brothers are currently at the Central 5th Laboratory.
Tell me more.
What's wrong?
Your movements are growing poorer.
Are you through already, Pee-Wee?
Who are you calling too small to even see, who doesn't even make for a good target!
?
At least your spirits are high.
But I wonder how much longer that will last!
Not the automail again...!
You leave yourself open!
You hold me in too low a regard.
Did you think you could best me from a spear's distance?
Ridiculous!
You've done well to have fought this long.
However, you have reached your limits.
Resign yourself.
There is no way you can win now.
We'll see about that.
You're forgetting that I am not alone.
Now, Al!
When did you get in here!
?
What!
?
Not fair!
All's fair in battle.
What's wrong?
My bloodseal is not yet broken.
If your soul is in your head, then once I cut it off, your body is just a hunk of iron.
There's no reason to fight you any longer.
Never mind that, there's something that I wanted to ask you.
The Philosopher's Stone?
If you've come to investigate this place, there is little else you could be after.
In that case, we can cut to the chase.
Why don't you tell me everything you know about it?
I can't tell you.
What!
?
Hey hey, beaten dogs don't get to show me up.
I'll break your bloodseal!
I haven't lost yet.
That's... impossible...!
One set of armor isn't necessarily limited to one soul, you know.
The body has a bloodseal, too...?
Are you okay, my older brother?
Yeah, just barely, my younger brother.
Younger brother?
Did I forget to mention that the mass murderer, the Slicer, was a pair of mass murdering brothers!
An independent head and body, huh?
That reeks of foul play!
Who was it that said "All's fair in battle"?
How dare you injure my brother!
You're going to pay for that, Pipsqueak!
Don't call me Pipsqueak!
Don't you take me so lightly!
Whoa, I'm not giving you any time to transmute!
I'm losing too much blood...
I'm seriously starting to get lightheaded...
This is serious trouble.
Am I going to die here?
Damn it!
If I die here...
If I die here who's going to return Al back to normal!
?
How dare you do that to my brother!
I can do that, too!
I won't give you enough time to transmute!
I just remembered that nasty fellow...
What is this!
?
He didn't perform transmutation, just the decomposition technique?
Sorry about that.
I can't die just yet.
- Damn it!
Now you've gone and done it, you dirty brat!
- Gross...
Why, you...!
Damn it!
I deserve better than this!
Damn...
Brother...!
Much as it pains me, we've lost, Brother.
You're not about to tell me that there's actually three of you brothers, right?
- No, no.
- No, no.
Well done, kid.
This time, you truly have won.
Well then, this time, tell me everything you know.
I cannot say.
Now, destroy us, at once.
What?
Nothing remains for the defeated except death.
That is our rule.
I'm not about to kill anyone.
Hmph!
You're far too generous!
With our bodies like this, can you possibly call us "someone"?
I didn't tell you to kill us.
I told you to destroy us.
Come on!
If I were to concede that you aren't people...
I'd...
I'd have to concede that my brother,
Al, is not a person, either.
Brother...?
Damn it!
Can we call it a fight, already?
I'm concerned about Brother.
Brother?
That pipsqueak alchemist is your brother?
Brother gets angry if you mention his height.
Ah, I see...
What?
So it was your brother that gave you that armored form!
That's right.
He risked his life to transmute me.
That's rich!
What's so funny!
?
Oh, how rude, how rude.
Brotherly love is so beautiful...
Even if it is false affection.
False...?
That's right!
False love!
That's not so!
My brother loves me for real!
What a perfectly naive fellow you are.
Suppose you were an imitation.
What would you do then?
Suppose your personality and memories were implanted in you as it suited your brother.
What would you do then?
T-that just isn't so!
I am, without question, a person, whose name is Alfonse Elric!
As a spirit - something indefinite, which cannot be seen with the eye.
How are you to prove that?
Your brother, and the people around you, could all be deceiving you.
That's... that's not...
My brother is a person, and you guys are people too.
I don't want... to kill you...
Brother?
Amusing...
Quite amusing.
For as long as I can remember, me and my brother have made our lives by stealing, breaking, killing, and being looked down upon as fiends and brutes.
Now that we have abandoned our bodies, it's like a miracle, to think that, for the first time, we are being treated as people.
It's so amusing!
I'm a person!
I'm Alphonse Elric!
Do you have any proof that you ever really existed?
Where is your body?
Well, it's...
It can't be...
For all of it to be false... that couldn't possibly be...
Listen, Al...
There's something I've been meaning to say to you for a long time but I've been too scared and I haven't been able to say it.
What is it?
What was Brother trying to tell me?
What was it that he was too scared to too scared to tell me?
Brother...!
Fullmetal Alchemist!
Episode 21: "Red Glow"
If there is a color to people's lives that's probably the color it would be.
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything... and the one son who had no choice... but to keep them all together.
It's Arrested Development.
Michael Bluth was at home working on a plan to save the company.
How's this for a business model?
We make the company look like it's in the black... by starting construction on the phase two development.
I know what you're thinking, we're not in the black.
How're we gonna build 30 houses without any money?
We don't.
We build one- then we have a huge ribbon-cutting ceremony while raising funds for the others.
Michael's father always unveiled his construction projects... with a highly publicized ribbon-cutting ceremony.
He even did so for the prison he built... and, somewhat ironically, would later occupy.
The only difference is this time I get to cut the ribbon.
What do you think?
There's a cream with real diamonds in it.
I can actually smear diamonds on my face, and it's only $400 a tub.
That's like, what, like a million diamonds for $400?
- Mm.
- A million- diamonds.
- Okay.
- Is she on you about that diamond cream?
My husband's jealous because since we decided to have an open marriage...
I've been doing a little better than he has.
It is not a competition, Lindsay.
We are doing this to save our marriage.
But I should be telling you that I have been meeting my fair share of groupies.
Or should I say "Bluepies"?
Tobias had recently auditioned as an understudy... for the silent performance art trio, the Blue Man Group.
And this is "Kids" from Bye, Bye, Birdie.
He had yet to hear back from them.
You guys really think you have the guts to go through with this "seeing other people" thing?
In fact, neither Lindsay nor Tobias did have the guts to go through with it.
- I already have.
- I have too.
Can I buy you a drink?
No.
- Lindsay, because she'd lost her self-confidence.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Where's she going?
And Tobias, because he was busy keeping an eye on Lindsay.
Who are you gonna bring to this ribbon-cutting dance?
It's not a dance, and you don't need a date.
Although, George Michael...
I'd love for you to come with me when I cut the ribbon at the new house.
Oh, wow.
Hey, can I bring Ann?
Who?
Ann.
You know, she's- she's the girl I'm kinda hanging out with.
- I haven't met Ann.
- Yes, you have.
- Michael had met Ann.
- You let her in.
See, that's her right over there.
- Oh, Ann.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.
I know Ann.
Hey, you!
She's got a little hard-boiled egg going there.
Oh, it's so cute.
She sometimes takes a little pack of mayonnaise... and she'll squirt it in her mouth, and then she'll take an egg... and kind of- mmm.
She calls it a mayonn-egg.
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel so good.
You know, I kind of wanna buy her a diamond.
- Her?
- Ann.
I know I can't afford it, but Aunt Lindsay was telling me about this diamond cream.
George Michael, um, I'm sure that Egg is a very nice person.
I just don't want you spending-
- It's Ann.
Her na- - all your money getting her all glittered up for Easter.
You know?
More importantly, I want us to do this together.
Kinda like a father-son sort of thing, you know?
And since Pop-Pop is no longer president, we get to do it.
- I thought Gob was president.
- Yeah, and I don't have any problem with that.
In fact, since Michael's father escaped from prison... his brother Gob had been made president, albeit in name only.
Which is why Michael was surprised when he got to work the next day.
- You're still in my office.
- Gosh, Michael, I am kind of the president.
And I have no problem with that.
But it is just a title, remember?
Just doing this to appease the stockholders, while they scrutinize me for Dad's crimes.
Hey, Dad may have illegally built some homes in Iraq, which is kinda not cool.
I know, but that's why I've got a business model... that I think is going to restore the image of our company.
We're going to build a second model home.
That's great.
Can I announce it to the board?
Gee, it is my business model.
If you had a business model, then by all means, go in there and do your little dance.
Tell you what we're gonna do.
Rock, paper, scissors for it.
- No, no, I'm not interested in doing-
- One, two, three.
- Paper covers rock.
- It is a rock though.
It should beat everything.
There's not a lot of logic to it.
It's like on a boat with "Women and children first."
Why should they-which, before I forget, I'm buying a company boat.
Sorry?
That morning, Gob had gone to a boat show, where he saw something he wanted.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- What a beauty.
- Thank you.
- I meant you.
- Well.
Gob flirted with her for a while, and finally asked for her number.
- Let's get some digits.
- I'm sorry.
I don't give it out without a firm offer.
Oh, I'll make you a firm offer.
Unfortunately, she wasn't flirting.
And here again, please.
- The Seaward.
- You're not getting a boat.
- One, two, three.
- No, not gonna do it.
- Paper covers rock.
- Fine.
But rock sinks boat.
- Michael?
- Mom, I'm right in the middle of something.
- Get rid of the Seaward.
- I'll leave when I'm good and ready.
It's about your Uncle Oscar.
I want him to move in with you.
You're not kicking him out already, are you?
Michael's uncle had recently moved into Lucille's apartment... where they quickly rekindled a long-dormant romance.
- It was a secret she hoped to keep-
- Oscar, we'll be heard.
- and he didn't.
- That's what makes it so hot.
Mother?
Mother!
- I heard zoo noises.
- It's nothing.
Go back to bed.
So, everybody's still up, huh?
It's not fair to Buster.
He's a nervous wreck right now.
He's going into the army, for God's sake.
You volunteered him.
I knew you were going to throw that in my face.
Don't worry about it, okay?
They're never gonna take him anyway.
At that moment, Buster was taking his physical at the recruitment center.
I don't have a hole in my heart.
I've never opened my eyes underwater.
My- Reproductive organ... is shaped like- a lobster tail... but without its shell, hmm?
Oh, I guess I have the panic attacks under control.
Oh, and I'm legally blind at night.
But Buster had miscalculated the army's current need for personnel.
Okay, then, let's get you fitted for a uniform.
What?
What?
Hey, why don't you volunteer Oscar?
That would solve both of your problems.
He'd never cut his hair.
That hair.
Listen, Oscar's your problem.
I'm taking care of everything else in this family... including starting construction on a second model home.
We're having a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
We can't have a ribbon-cutting without your father, and he's God knows where.
George Sr. Was in Mexico... with his escape accomplice and ex-secretary, Kitty.
I keep eating so many eggs.
It must be my unconscious desire to have a baby.
Oh, my God.
Can you even imagine how cute the combination of the two of us would be?
I mean, we're all out of "prophylacticos" anyway.
Somebody used the last two on his feet to walk across the bathroom floor.
But he was growing tired of their confined intimacy.
- I've made a huge mistake.
- Hey, it's me.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
Listen, I gotta make this quick.
You're the only one who can save the family, but you gotta keep the company strong... because I'm gonna need some of that money later.
I will, Dad.
It's funny, after all these years of...
- you making fun of me for the magic shows and-
- Gob!
Oh, for God's
- I called to talk to Michael, you horse's-
- Gob was hurt.
- Bye, Pop.
Hey, whoa, whoa, was that Dad?
Yeah, I had to, uh, jump off.
You just had Dad on the phone?
Where was he?
No way to tell, really.
Portugal.
- Down South America way.
- Well, did he wanna talk to me?
No, he wanted to talk to the president.
- I have no problem with that.
- Michael was also hurt.
And George Sr. Was brutally hurt... when he was mistaken for his twin brother Oscar.
Marijuana?
No, no.
That's my brother.
"Brothero.
Brothero."
That night, Lindsay headed to the club... to try again to meet someone.
Soon, having struck out again, she spotted a man who looked interesting.
He had the lean look, effortless hair... and dressed-down manner of a movie star.
- Buy me a drink?
- I think the bar's closing.
I know a place.
It was at that point that Lindsay had a startling revelation.
Uh, uh, uh, you get out.
Get out.
Get out.
Out, out, out!
- No homeless in here!
- Homeless?
You're homeless?
You're gross.
Oh, God.
They're taking me in the army.
They didn't think there was enough wrong with me.
Well, did they check everything?
Yes.
They even touched my Charlie Browns.
You lied to me.
- You said I wasn't fit to serve.
- Okay, hold on.
Let's calm down, people.
Um, I think I know a little bit about avoiding combat duty.
Now which pinkie do you use less?
Are you nuts?
Do you know what I went through to have this boy?
Oh, I know where the boy came from.
Wait.
Why were you in the pantry?
And Lucille realized it was time to end... whatever it was she had with Oscar.
So, I believe it's a good plan.
The next day, Michael was ready to wow the board with his new business model.
As I told my brother, the president... if we start construction on a second model home... we can be cutting this ribbon within two months.
I said, "That's why you're no longer president."
Two weeks.
Let's do it in two weeks.
Hey!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Can we stop the music?
I'm not as optimistic that we can get that done.
Gob, I think we both agree that we would do things your way... if you had a business model.
Do you have a business model, Gob?
I am so happy that you asked me that, Michael... because I just happen to have a business model right here.
Solid as a rock
Meet Starla, the new Bluth Company business model... for our phase two campaign.
Solid as a rock.
We'll see you at the ribbon-cutting in two weeks... if my brother doesn't screw it up first.
- Hey!
Gob had committed Michael to building a model home in two weeks.
We can't build a house in two weeks.
Also, I'm not sure how "Solid as a Rock"... helps people forget the fact that we built houses in Iraq.
- I love that.
- But you probably know best because you're president.
We don't have to build a real house, Michael.
Like you said, it's all for appearances anyway.
We throw up a couple of walls.
- We build a fake one.
- What are you talking about?
Nothing on the inside.
I'll never get a crew to build it.
They'd lose their licenses.
Then you build it yourself, damn it!
Hey, there she is, my little business model.
Sorry about that "build it yourself' crap.
I might take her to the ribbon-cutting.
- You end up finding a date yet?
- No.
As Michael grew frustrated by his relationship with Gob...
Lucille tried to end hers with Oscar.
- I want you out of the house.
- Oh, I want you everywhere.
Oscar, no.
I can't have this in my life anymore.
I'm a married woman.
Lucille, you wanna leave?
I won't chase after you.
But before you do, ask yourself, "Where's your husband?"
Because I am here.
I am real.
I am flesh and blood.
And hair.
Oh, God, that hair.
What will people say?
They'll say, "Those people are in love."
That night, the evening news report said something very different.
Lucille Bluth, caught on tape breathing life into a homeless man.
The surprising home video at 10:00.
And Michael prepared to build a house.
Two weeks?
But what if my date's not available?
I'm trying to get a last-minute crew together.
Your inability to get a man interested...
- is not at the top of my list.
- Oh, I've got a man interested, Michael.
- What's wrong with him?
- There's nothing wrong with him.
He is homeless.
Well, I didn't know he was homeless at the time.
- It was humiliating.
- Is this about Gangy's homeless guy?
- Gangy's homeless guy?
- Yeah, it's all over the news.
Gangy gave C.P.R. To a homeless guy on the beach.
Lindsay felt respect for her mother... and decided that perhaps she could overcome her pride and help someone too.
I've got someone for your crew, Michael.
My boyfriend, the homeless guy.
I wonder if he even has an apartment or-
- Hello.
- Did you see the news?
Your Uncle Oscar forced himself on me at the beach today...
- and I didn't have my horn.
- Of course.
It was Uncle Oscar.
Mom, you're not having an affair with him, are you?
You're building a house?
I want you to give it to him.
- It's not a real house.
- Perfect.
He's not a real man.
And George Sr. Made his case to the Mexican police.
My God, I was beaten up here.
I'm telling you.
I'm George.
I'm not Oscar.
I'm George.
- The Cornballer.
- Ssí.
The Cornballer.
George Sr. Had marketed a device called the Cornballer in Mexico... after the severe burns it caused led to it being banned in the U.S.
- Why, did you have one?
- Ssí.
Lindsay, meanwhile, was having trouble finding her homeless man.
- He looked like a movie star.
- The man looked like a movie star because he was a movie star.
His name was Tom Jane, and he was making two movies for a major studio.
One was a gritty personal project about a junkie's life... which he got to do in exchange for making... a rigidly, formulaic popcorn movie.
- He was living on the streets, researching his role.
- Hey, homeless guy.
- Hey.
- I'm not proud of the way...
I was so grossed out when I found out you were gross before.
You really thought I was gross, huh?
Well, at first, I thought you were kind of hot, but I hadn't looked closely enough.
Listen, I have a construction job for you.
And if you clean yourself up, who knows?
You might actually get a date out of this.
- Okay.
- See ya.
Okay, we've all made some sacrifices to be here, but we all want the same thing.
- I wanna live here.
- I wanna buy Ann some diamond dust.
I'm just hoping to get mildly injured, so I can get out of the army.
Bottom line is we've got two weeks to build a house.
It doesn't have to be good.
It just has to look good.
I just want my kids back.
And so, the guys went to work.
Things didn't go smoothly at first.
Buster looked for ways to hurt himself.
But soon the project came together- when Gob stopped by.
Now we're building a house.
- Yeah, I'm pretty proud-
- So, what do you think?
Did I do this or what?
Seems like your brother did it.
My brother does what I tell him to do.
I'm the president.
Where's your "P"?
What?
Oh, no, not again.
I got it.
Hey, sorry for the "my brother does what I tell him to do" crap... but I want this to be perfect for when I cut the ribbon tomorrow.
You're cutting the ribbon?
I kinda thought that since I built it...
- I might go ahead and give it a-
- Yeah, okay.
Can you imagine how that would look to the board?
The construction worker cutting the ribbon.
No, no, that's a job for the president.
Michael had a problem with that.
- Gob had taken away something Michael always wanted.
- You got the "P."
Now it was Michael's turn to take something from Gob
- Starla.
And later, Michael set about his plan.
Gob, do you have Starla's phone number?
I got a few business things I'd like to go over with the business model.
Guess who was just over her?
Don't, I'll tell you- me.
- Hmm?
- L- the business model.
Actually, theyjust made out.
Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms.
Imagine that.
I finally nailed somebody that you weren't after.
That's it.
I've worked too hard and too long for you to keep getting all the credit.
I built that company, that house, and I'm gonna be cutting the ribbon... whether we're all pretending that you're president or not.
Yeah, sure.
I just wanted-
- You just wanted what?
- I just wanted you to be impressed with me.
Dad never was.
Never said a nice thing about me.
He called you the other day.
He didn't even wanna talk to me.
Of course he did!
He never wants to talk to me.
He never has.
- Cut the ribbon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
How about that?
- Michael.
I have no problem with it.
- All right?
Take it easy.
Come on.
- Thank you.
The next day, the Bluth family prepared to unveil phase two.
Have you seen your Uncle Gob around?
No.
And I can't find that diamond dust that Aunt Lindsay bought for me.
Oh, well, your Aunt Lindsay has probably taken it.
She's just a taker.
This is your chance, huh?
With the big ribbon-cutters after all these years?
Well, actually, I figured, give Gob a chance, you know?
The guy doesn't get a whole lot of attention in this family.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the Bluth Company, Gob Bluth.
My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done.
But I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done"... for an answer.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you phase two of the Bluth Company.
A house truly solid as a rock.
But as it turns out...
Michael was right to not be optimistic it could be done.
And Buster saw the chance to get injured enough... to keep him out of the army.
But instead...
- got a glimpse inside.
- I can't look at that.
Unfortunately, Tobias had to.
I got the wrong homeless man.
I am sorry.
I was looking for Lindsay.
You lied to me.
You both lied to me.
I'm goin'to war.
- Buster, you can't!
- Yes, I can.
I don't agree with your dirty doings here... but I will defend with my life your right to do it.
You planned this all along, didn't you, Michael?
- No, I didn't.
I had no crew.
I had no time.
- You set me up.
Gob charged at Michael with the scissors... but Michael, as he always did, picked rock-
- You wanted to make me look foolish!
- Put down the scissors.
- Put 'em down.
- Foolish with scissors!
Which beat scissors.
Unfortunately, the whole incident was covered by the paper.
Nobody looks good in this.
- Especially that little dude.
- That's Ann.
- Who's-
- It doesn't matter.
Listen.
You know I didn't set you up, okay?
I think the only reason you and I always fight... is that since we were little kids, Dad's always played us off each other.
Dad always said that was your fault.
Anyway, what we oughta do is make a decision right now... not to let Dad get in the middle of our relationship anymore.
- He's not even in town, and we're fighting.
- We're grown men.
- Yeah, let's just move on.
- Look at me.
I'm the president of a company now.
Oh, that's Dad's line.
I bet he saw the paper.
Listen, if you want my respect, you won't answer that, okay?
It's just gonna cause more problems.
Hello?
They hung up.
They hung up on me.
Hiya, guys.
I couldn't get the money.
I don't know what happened.
- I'm impressed you hung up.
- Did I hang up?
- I meant to hit speaker.
- Oh.
- You gotta hit the line first.
- I'm hitting both at the same time.
- These are the lines.
There's a line here.
- But she said-
- It's line and then-
- Hey.
I don't wanna wait until Dad's dead for us to get along.
But it was too late... as George Sr. Would be declared dead... within the hour.
- From now on, we support each other.
- We start with a clean slate.
- Yeah.
- We almost did it though, didn't we?
We almost pulled it off.
- No, it wasn't even close.
- Yeah, a lot of people got hurt.
- This was very, very bad.
- Not great.
Not great.
On the next Arrested Development.
Lindsay finds out the true identity ofher homeless man.
Look.
You're a really nice chick, but I'm not homeless.
I'm Tom Jane.
And even though Lindsay doesn't know who that is... hearing that he isn't homeless is good enough for her.
- Buy me a drink?
- You're really sweet, but, no.
I'm Tom Jane.
And Lindsay, crushed and alone... for the first time misses her husband.
Tobias.
Lindsay, I'm-
Is that George Michael's diamond cream?
Oh, yes, well, I ran out of blue, and I couldn't find anything else.
I think my nipples are bleeding though.
I don't know if you're supposed to use quite this much.
- That guy's a jerk.
- No, I am.
No, no, I am.
Because I think I need to go to the hospital right away... and see if I can't get some of this diamond dust vacuumed from out of my lungs.
This way.
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.
It's Arrested Development.
Michael Bluth was at home working on a plan to save the company.
How's this for a business model?
We make the company look like it's in the black by starting construction on the Phase Two development.
I know what you're thinking-- we're not in the black.
How are we going to build 30 houses without any money?
We don't.
We build one.
Then we have a huge ribbon-cutting ceremony while we're raising the funds for the others.
Michael's father always unveiled his construction projects with a highly-publicized ribbon-cutting ceremony.
He even did so for the prison he built and, somewhat ironically, would later occupy.
The only difference is, this time
I get to cut the ribbon.
What do you think?
There's a cream with real diamonds in it.
I can actually smear diamonds on my face!
And it's only $400 a tub!
That's, like, what, like, a million diamonds for $400?
- A million ( bleep ) diamonds!
- Okay.
Is she on you about that diamond cream?
My husband's jealous because, since we decided to have an open marriage,
I've been doing a little better than he has.
It is not a competition, Lindsay.
We are doing this to save our marriage.
But I should be telling you that I have been meeting my fair share of groupies.
Or should I say "blue-pies"?
Tobias had recently auditioned as an understudy for the silent performance-art trio, the "Blue Man Group."
And this is "Kids," from Bye Bye Birdie.
He had yet to hear back from them.
You guys think you have the guts to go through this seeing other people thing ?
In fact, neither Lindsay nor Tobias did have the guts to go through with it.
- I already have.
- I have, too.
Can I buy you a drink?
No.
Lindsay, because she'd lost her self-confidence.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Where's she going?
And Tobias because he was busy keeping an eye on Lindsay.
Who are you going to bring to this ribbon-cutting dance?
It's not a dance, and you don't need a date.
Although...
George Michael,
I'd love for you to come with me when I cut the ribbon at the new house.
Oh, wow.
Hey, can I bring Ann?
- Who?
- Ann.
You know, she's...
She's the girl I'm kind of hanging out with.
- I haven't met Ann.
- Yes, you have.
Michael had met Ann.
You let her in.
See, that's ...
That's her right over there.
Oh, Ann.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
I know Ann.
Hey, you!
She's got a little hard-boiled egg going there?
Oh, it's so cute.
She sometimes takes a little pack of mayonnaise, and she'll squirt it in her mouth all over, and then she'll take an egg and kind of...
Mmmm!
She calls it a "mayonegg."
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel so good.
You know, I kind of want to buy her a diamond.
- Her?
- Ann.
I know I can't afford it, but Aunt Lindsay was telling me about this diamond cream...
George Michael, I'm sure that Egg is a very nice person.
I just don't want you spending all your money getting her all glittered up for Easter, you know?
More importantly, I want us to do this together-- kind of like a father-son sort of thing, you know?
And since Pop is no longer president, we get to do it.
But I thought Gob was president now.
Yeah, and I don't have any problem with that.
In fact, since Michael's father escaped from prison, his brother Gob had been made president, albeit, in name only... which is why Michael was surprised when he got to work the next day.
Ah, you're still in my office.
Gosh, Michael, I am kind of the president.
And I have no problem with that, but it is just a title, remember?
I'm just doing this to appease the stockholders while they scrutinize me for Dad's crimes.
Hey, look, Dad may have illegally built some homes in Iraq, which is kind of not cool...
But that's why I've got a business model that I think is going to restore the image of our company.
We're going to build a second model home.
That's great.
- Can I announce it to the board?
- Gee, it is my business model.
I mean, if you had a business model, then by all means, you go in there and do...
Tell you what we're going to do.
Rock-paper-scissors for it.
- No, no, I'm not...
- One, two, three...
Paper covers rock.
Ah, it is a rock, though.
Should beat everything.
There's not a lot of logic to it.
It's kind of like on a boat with women and children first.
Before I forget, I'm buying a company boat.
S orry?
That morning, Gob had gone to a boat show where he saw something he wanted.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- What a beauty.
- Thank you.
- I meant you.
- Well...
Gob flirted with her for awhile, and finally asked for her number.
Let's get some digits.
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't give it out without a firm offer.
Oh, I'll make you a firm offer.
- Unfortunately, she wasn't flirting.
- And here again, please.
- The Seaward.
- You're not getting a boat.
- One, two, three...
- Not gonna do it.
- Paper covers rock.
- Fine, but rock sinks boat.
Michael?
Mom, I-I'm right in the middle of something.
- Get rid of the Seaward.
- I'll leave when I'm good and ready.
It's about your Uncle Oscar.
I want him to move in with you.
You're not kicking him out already, are you?
Michael's uncle had recently moved into Lucille's apartment where they quickly rekindled a long-dormant romance.
It was a secret she hoped to keep...
Oscar, we'll be heard.
...and he didn't.
That's what makes it so hot.
Mother?
Mother, I heard zoo noises.
It's nothing; go back to bed.
So... everybody's still up, huh?
It's not fair to Buster.
He's a nervous wreck right now.
He's going into the Army, for God's sake.
You volunteered him.
I knew you were going to throw that in my face.
Don't worry about it.
They're never going to take him.
At that moment, Buster was taking his physical at the recruitment center.
...hole in my heart.
I've never opened my eyes underwater.
My, um... genital area is shaped like a...
lobster tail, but without its shell.
Uh, oh, I guess I have the panic attacks under control.
Oh, and I'm legally blind at night.
But Buster had miscalculated the Army's current need for personnel.
Okay, then, let's get you fitted for a uniform.
What?
Hey, why don't you volunteer Oscar?
That would solve both your problems.
He'd never cut his hair.
That hair...
Listen, Oscar's your problem.
I'm taking care of everything else in this family, including starting construction on a second model home.
We're having a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
Michael, we can't have a ribbon cutting without your father, and he's God knows where.
George Sr. was in Mexico with his escape accomplice and ex-secretary, Kitty...
Eggs.
It must be my unconscious desire to have a baby.
Oh, my God, can you even imagine how cute the combination of the two of us would be?
I mean, we're all out of "prophylacticos," anyway.
Somebody used the last two on his feet to walk across the bathroom floor.
...but he was growing tired of their confined intimacy.
I've made a huge mistake.
- Hey, it's me.
- Dad?
Listen, I got to make this quick.
You're the only one who can save the family.
But you got to keep the company strong, because I'm going to need some of that money later.
I will, Dad.
It's funny, after all these years of you making fun of me for the magic shows, and...
Gob?
Oh, for God's...!
I called to talk to Michael, you horse's...
Gracias para usar al Tijuana Bell.
- Gob was hurt.
- Bye, Pop.
Hey, whoa-whoa.
Was that Dad?
Yeah.
I had to, uh, jump off.
You just had Dad on the phone?
Where was he?
No way to tell, really.
Portugal, down South America way...
Well, did he want to talk to me?
No.
He wanted to talk to the president.
I have no problem with that.
Michael was also hurt.
And George Sr. was brutally hurt when he was mistaken for his twin brother, Oscar.
Por la venta la marijuana!
Marijuana?
No, no, that's my brother. "Brothero.
Brothero."
That night, Lindsay headed to the club to try again to meet someone.
Soon, having struck out again, she spotted a man who looked interesting.
He had the lean look, effortless hair and dressed down manner of a movie star.
Buy me a drink?
- I think the bars are closing.
- I know a place.
It was at that point that Lindsay had a startling revelation.
Uh, uh, uh, get out, get out, get out!
Out, out, out, out!
No homeless in here.
"Homeless"?
Oh, you're homeless?
You're gross.
Oh, God.
They're taking me in the Army.
They didn't think there was enough wrong with me.
Well, did they check everything?
Yes!
They even touched my Charlie Browns.
You lied to me.
You said I wasn't fit to serve!
All right, let's calm down, people.
Um, I think I know a little bit about avoiding combat duty.
Now, which pinky do you use less?
Are you nuts?
!
Do you know what I went through to have this boy?
Oh, I know where the boy came from.
Wait.
Why were you in the pantry?
And Lucille realized it was time to end whatever it was she had with Oscar.
The next day, Michael was ready to wow the board with his new business model.
As I told my brother, the president, if we start construction on a second model home, we can be cutting this ribbon within two months.
And I said, "That's why you're no longer president.
"Two weeks!
Let's do it in two weeks!"
Hey!
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Could we stop the music?
I'm not as optimistic that we can get that done.
Gob, I think we both agreed that we would do things your way if you had a business model.
Do you have a business model?
I am so happy that you asked me that, Michael, because I just happen to have a business model right here.
Meet Starla, the new Bluth Company business model for our Phase Two campaign!
"Bluth Homes-
- Solid as a Rock."
We'll see you at the ribbon-cutting in two weeks!
If my brother doesn't screw it up first.
Hey!
Gob had just committed Michael to building a model home in two weeks.
We can't build a house in two weeks.
Also, I'm not so sure how "solid as a rock"
helps people forget the fact that we built houses in Iraq.
- I love that.
- But you probably know best, because...
We don't have to build a real house, Michael.
Like you said, it's all for appearances anyway.
We throw up a couple of walls...
We build a fake one.
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing on the inside.
I'll never get a crew to build it.
They'd lose their licenses.
Then you build it yourself, damn it!
Hey, there she is.
My little business model.
Sorry about that "build it yourself" crap.
I was thinking I might take her to the ribbon cutting.
You end up finding a date yet?
No.
As Michael grew frustrated by his relationship with Gob,
Lucille tried to end hers with Oscar.
I want you out of the house.
- Oh, I want you everywhere.
- Oscar, no.
I can't have this in my life anymore.
I'm a married woman.
Lucille, you want to leave, I won't chase after you.
But before you do, ask yourself-- where's your husband?
Because I am here.
I'm real,
I am flesh and blood and hair.
Oh, God, that hair.
What will people say?
They'll say those people... are in love.
In fact, that night the evening news report said something very different.
Lucille Bluth, caught on tape breathing life into a homeless man.
The surprising home video at 10:00.
And Michael prepared to build a house.
Two weeks?
But what if my dates aren't available?
I'm trying to get a last minute crew together, Lindsay.
Your inability to get a man interested is not at the top of my list.
Oh, I've got a man interested, Michael.
What's wrong with him?
There's nothing wrong with him.
He is homeless.
Well, I didn't know he was homeless at the time.
It's humiliating.
Is this about Gangee's homeless guy?
Gangee's homeless guy?
Yeah, it's all over the news.
Gangee gave CPR to a homeless guy on the beach.
Lindsay felt respect for her mother, and decided that perhaps she could overcome her pride and help someone, too.
I've got someone for your crew, Michael.
My boyfriend.
The homeless guy.
I wonder if he even has an apartment or anything.
Hello.
Did you see the news?
Your Uncle Oscar forced himself on me at the beach today, and I didn't have my horn.
Of course.
It was Uncle Oscar.
Mom, you're not having an affair with him, are you?
You're building a house.
I want you to give it to him.
- It's not a real house.
- Perfect, he's not a real man.
And George Sr. made his case to the Mexican police.
I've been beaten up here.
I tell you, I'm George, I'm not Oscar, I'm George!
The cornballer.
Si, the cornballer.
George Sr. had marketed a device called the Cornballer in Mexico after the severe burns it caused led to it being banned in the U.S.
- Why, did you have one?
- Si.
Lindsay meanwhile, was having trouble finding her homeless man.
In fact, the man looked like a movie star because he was a movie star.
His name was Tom Jane, and he was making two movies for a major studio.
One was a gritty personal project about a junkie's life, which he only got to do in exchange for making a rigidly formulaic popcorn movie.
He was living on the streets researching his role.
- Hey, homeless guy.
- Hey.
I'm not proud of the way
I was so grossed out when I found out you were gross before.
You really thought I was gross, huh?
Well, at first I thought you were kind of hot, but...
I hadn't looked closely enough.
Listen, I have a construction job for you.
And if you clean yourself up, who knows, you might actually get a date out of this.
Okay.
See ya.
Okay, we've all made some sacrifices to be here, but we all want the same thing.
I want to live here.
I want to buy Ann some diamond dust.
I'm just hoping to get mildly injured so I can get out of the army.
Bottom line is, we've got two weeks to build a house.
Doesn't have to be good, just has to look good.
I just want my kids back.
And so the guys went to work.
Things didn't go smoothly at first.
Buster looked for ways to hurt himself.
But soon, the project came together when Gob stopped by.
Now we're building a house.
Yeah, I'm pretty proud.
So, what do you think?
Did I do this, or what?
Seems like your brother did it.
My brother does what I tell him to do.
I'm the president.
Where's your "P"?
Huh?
Oh, not again.
I got it.
Hey, sorry about that "My brother does what I tell him to do" crap, but I want this to be perfect for when I cut the ribbon tomorrow.
You're cutting the ribbon?
I kind of thought that, since I built it, I might go ahead and...
Yeah, okay.
Can you imagine how that'd look to the board?
The construction worker cutting the ribbon?
No, no, that's a job for the president.
Michael had a problem with that.
Gob had taken away something Michael always wanted,
We got the "P"!
and now it was Michael's turn to take something from Gob...
Starla.
And later, Michael set about his plan to woo Starla.
Gob, do you have Starla's phone number?
I got a few business things I'd like to go over with the business model.
Guess who was just over her?
Don't.
I'll tell you.
Me.
- Hmm?
- I ( bleep ) the business model.
Actually, they just made out.
Yeah.
She had all kinds of orgasms.
Imagine that.
I finally nailed somebody you weren't after.
That's it.
I've worked too hard and too long for you to keep getting all the credit, all right?
I built that company.
I built that house.
And I'm going to be cutting the ribbon whether we're all pretending that you're president or not.
Yeah, sure, I just wanted...
You just wanted what?
I just wanted you to be impressed with me.
Dad never was.
Never said a nice thing about me.
He called you the other day.
He didn't even want to talk to me.
Of course he did.
Never wants to talk to me.
Never has.
- Cut the ribbon.
- Really?
- Yeah, how'bout that?
- Michael...
I have no problem with it.
All right?
Take it easy.
- Thank you, partner.
- Come on.
The next day, the Bluth family prepared to unveil Phase Two.
Have you seen your Uncle Gob around?
No, and I can't find that diamond dust that Aunt Lindsay bought for me.
Oh, well, your Aunt Lindsay has probably taken it.
This is your chance, huh, with the big ribbon-cutters?
After all these years...
Well, actually, I figured give Gob a chance.
You know, the guy doesn't get a whole lot of attention in this family.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the Bluth Company, Gawb Bluth.
My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you Phase Two of the Bluth Company:
a house truly solid as a rock.
But as it turns out,
Michael was right to not be optimistic it could be done.
And Buster saw the chance to get injured enough to keep out of the Army.
But instead got a glimpse inside.
I can't look at that.
Unfortunately, Tobias had to.
I got the wrong homeless man.
I am sorry.
I was looking for Lindsay.
You lied to me.
You both lied to me!
- I'm going to war.
- Buster, you can't!
Yes, I can.
I don't agree with your dirty doings here, but I will defend with my life your right to do it.
You planned this all out, didn't you, Michael?
No, I didn't.
I had no crew.
I had no time.
You set me up.
Gob charged at Michael with the scissors, but Michael, as he always did, picked rock which beat scissors.
Unfortunately, the whole incident was covered by the paper.
- Nobody looks good in this.
- Especially that little dude.
That's Ann.
- Who?
- It doesn't matter.
Listen.
You know I didn't set you up, okay?
I really think the only reason you and I always fight is that since we were little kids, Dad's always played us off each other.
Dad always said that was your fault.
Anyway, what we ought to do is make a decision right now not to let Dad get in the middle of our relationship anymore.
I mean, he's not even in town, and we're fighting about it.
- We're grown men.
- Yeah, let's just move on.
I mean, look at me.
I'm the president of a company now.
Oh, that's Dad's line.
I bet he saw the paper.
Listen, if you want my respect, you won't answer that, okay?
It's just going to cause more problems.
Hello?
They hung up.
They hung up on me.
Hi, you guys.
Well, I couldn't get that money.
I'm impressed you hung up on him.
Did I hang up on him?
I meant to hit speaker.
Oh, well, you got to hit the line first...
No, I understand-- both of them at the same time.
- These are the lines...
- But she said...
- Look, could we...?
- There's a line right here, Gob, hey...
I don't want to wait until Dad's dead for us to get along.
But it was too late, as George Sr. would be declared dead within the hour.
From now on, we support each other.
- We start with a clean slate.
- Yeah.
We almost did it, though, didn't we?
We almost pulled it off.
No, it wasn't even close.
Yeah, a lot of people got hurt.
- This was very, very bad.
- I agree.
I agree.
On the next Arrested Develompent:
Lindsay finds out the true identity of her homeless man.
Look, uh, you're a really nice chick, but, um,
I'm not homeless.
I'm Tom Jane.
And even though Lindsay doesn't know who that is, hearing that he isn't homeless is good enough for her.
- Buy me a drink?
- Oh, you're really sweet, but no.
I'm Tom Jane.
And Lindsay, crushed and alone, for the first time misses her husband.
Tobias...
Lindsay, um...
Is that George Michael's diamond cream?
Oh, yes, well, I-I ran out of blue, and I couldn't find anything else.
I think my nipples are bleeding, though I don't know if you're supposed to use quite this much, but I...
- That guy's a jerk.
- No, I am.
No... no...
I am, because I think I need to go to the hospital right away and see if I can't get some of this diamond dust vacuumed from out of my lungs.
This way.
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything... and the one son who had no choice... but to keep them all together.
It's Arrested Development.
[Man Narrating] Michael Bluth was at home working on a plan to save the company.
How's this for a business model?
We make the company look like it's in the black... by starting construction on the phase two development.
I know what you're thinking, we're not in the black.
How're we gonna build 30 houses without any money?
We don't.
We build one- then we have a huge ribbon-cutting ceremony while raising funds for the others.
[Narrator] Michael's father always unveiled his construction projects... with a highly publicized ribbon-cutting ceremony.
He even did so for the prison he built... and, somewhat ironically, would later occupy.
The only difference is this time I get to cut the ribbon.
What do you think?
There's a cream with real diamonds in it.
I can actually smear diamonds on my face, and it's only $400 a tub.
That's like, what, like a million diamonds for $400?
- Mm.
- A million- [Bleeps] diamonds.
- Okay.
- Is she on you about that diamond cream?
My husband's jealous because since we decided to have an open marriage...
I've been doing a little better than he has.
It is not a competition, Lindsay.
We are doing this to save our marriage.
But I should be telling you that I have been meeting my fair share of groupies.
Or should I say "Bluepies"?
[Narrator] Tobias had recently auditioned as an understudy... for the silent performance art trio, the Blue Man Group.
- And this is "Kids" from Bye, Bye, Birdie.
- [Piano]
[Narrator] He had yet to hear back from them.
You guys really think you have the guts to go through with this "seeing other people" thing?
[Narrator] In fact, neither Lindsay nor Tobias did have the guts to go through with it.
- I already have.
- I have too.
Can I buy you a drink?
- No.
- [Narrator] Lindsay, because she'd lost her self-confidence.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Where's she going?
[Narrator] And Tobias, because he was busy keeping an eye on Lindsay.
Who are you gonna bring to this ribbon-cutting dance?
It's not a dance, and you don't need a date.
Although, George Michael...
I'd love for you to come with me when I cut the ribbon at the new house.
Oh, wow.
Hey, can I bring Ann?
Who?
Ann.
You know, she's- she's the girl I'm kinda hanging out with.
- I haven't met Ann.
- Yes, you have.
- [Narrator] Michael had met Ann.
- You let her in.
See, that's her right over there.
- Oh, Ann.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.
I know Ann.
Hey, you!
She's got a little hard-boiled egg going there.
Oh, it's so cute.
She sometimes takes a little pack of mayonnaise... and she'll squirt it in her mouth, and then she'll take an egg... and kind of- mmm.
She calls it a mayonn-egg.
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel so good.
You know, I kind of wanna buy her a diamond.
- Her?
- Ann.
I know I can't afford it, but Aunt Lindsay was telling me about this diamond cream.
George Michael, um, I'm sure that Egg is a very nice person.
I just don't want you spending-
- It's Ann.
Her na- - all your money getting her all glittered up for Easter.
You know?
More importantly, I want us to do this together.
Kinda like a father-son sort of thing, you know?
And since Pop-Pop is no longer president, we get to do it.
- I thought Gob was president.
- Yeah, and I don't have any problem with that.
[Narrator] In fact, since Michael's father escaped from prison... his brother Gob had been made president, albeit in name only.
Which is why Michael was surprised when he got to work the next day.
- You're still in my office.
- Gosh, Michael, I am kind of the president.
And I have no problem with that.
But it is just a title, remember?
Just doing this to appease the stockholders, while they scrutinize me for Dad's crimes.
Hey, Dad may have illegally built some homes in Iraq, which is kinda not cool.
I know, but that's why I've got a business model... that I think is going to restore the image of our company.
We're going to build a second model home.
That's great.
Can I announce it to the board?
Gee, it is my business model.
If you had a business model, then by all means, go in there and do your little dance.
Tell you what we're gonna do.
Rock, paper, scissors for it.
- No, no, I'm not interested in doing-
- One, two, three.
- Paper covers rock.
- It is a rock though.
It should beat everything.
There's not a lot of logic to it.
It's like on a boat with "Women and children first."
Why should they-which, before I forget, I'm buying a company boat.
Sorry?
[Narrator] That morning, Gob had gone to a boat show, where he saw something he wanted.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- What a beauty.
- Thank you.
- I meant you.
- Well.
[Narrator] Gob flirted with her for a while, and finally asked for her number.
- Let's get some digits.
- I'm sorry.
I don't give it out without a firm offer.
Oh, I'll make you a firm offer.
[Narrator] Unfortunately, she wasn't flirting.
And here again, please.
- The Seaward.
- You're not getting a boat.
- One, two, three.
- No, not gonna do it.
- Paper covers rock.
- Fine.
But rock sinks boat.
- Michael?
- Mom, I'm right in the middle of something.
- Get rid of the Seaward.
- I'll leave when I'm good and ready.
It's about your Uncle Oscar.
I want him to move in with you.
You're not kicking him out already, are you?
[Narrator] Michael's uncle had recently moved into Lucille's apartment... where they quickly rekindled a long-dormant romance.
- It was a secret she hoped to keep-
- Oscar, we'll be heard.
- and he didn't.
- That's what makes it so hot.
[Buster] Mother?
Mother!
- I heard zoo noises.
- It's nothing.
Go back to bed.
So, everybody's still up, huh?
[Whimpering]
It's not fair to Buster.
He's a nervous wreck right now.
He's going into the army, for God's sake.
You volunteered him.
I knew you were going to throw that in my face.
Don't worry about it, okay?
They're never gonna take him anyway.
[Narrator] At that moment, Buster was taking his physical at the recruitment center.
I don't have a hole in my heart.
I've never opened my eyes underwater.
My- [Whispers] Reproductive organ... is shaped like- [Whispers] a lobster tail... but without its shell, hmm?
Oh, I guess I have the panic attacks under control.
Oh, and I'm legally blind at night.
[Narrator] But Buster had miscalculated the army's current need for personnel.
Okay, then, let's get you fitted for a uniform.
What?
What?
Hey, why don't you volunteer Oscar?
That would solve both of your problems.
He'd never cut his hair.
[Inhales] That hair.
Listen, Oscar's your problem.
I'm taking care of everything else in this family... including starting construction on a second model home.
We're having a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
We can't have a ribbon-cutting without your father, and he's God knows where.
[Narrator] George Sr. Was in Mexico... with his escape accomplice and ex-secretary, Kitty.
I keep eating so many eggs.
It must be my unconscious desire to have a baby.
Oh, my God.
Can you even imagine how cute the combination of the two of us would be?
I mean, we're all out of "prophylacticos" anyway.
Somebody used the last two on his feet to walk across the bathroom floor.
[Narrator] But he was growing tired of their confined intimacy.
- I've made a huge mistake.
- Hey, it's me.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
Listen, I gotta make this quick.
You're the only one who can save the family, but you gotta keep the company strong... because I'm gonna need some of that money later.
I will, Dad.
It's funny, after all these years of...
- you making fun of me for the magic shows and-
- Gob!
Oh, for God's
- I called to talk to Michael, you horse's [Mexican] - [Female Operator Speaking Spanish]
- [Narrator] Gob was hurt.
- Bye, Pop.
Hey, whoa, whoa, was that Dad?
Yeah, I had to, uh, jump off.
You just had Dad on the phone?
Where was he?
No way to tell, really.
Portugal.
- Down South America way.
- Well, did he wanna talk to me?
No, he wanted to talk to the president.
- I have no problem with that.
- [Narrator] Michael was also hurt.
And George Sr. Was brutally hurt... when he was mistaken for his twin brother Oscar.
- [In Spanish]
- Marijuana?
No, no.
That's my brother.
"Brothero.
Brothero."
[Narrator] That night, Lindsay headed to the club... to try again to meet someone.
Soon, having struck out again, she spotted a man who looked interesting.
He had the lean look, effortless hair... and dressed-down manner of a movie star.
- Buy me a drink?
- I think the bar's closing.
I know a place.
[Narrator] It was at that point that Lindsay had a startling revelation.
[Man] Uh, uh, uh, you get out.
Get out.
Get out.
Out, out, out!
- No homeless in here!
- Homeless?
You're homeless?
You're gross.
Oh, God.
[SlowJazz]
They're taking me in the army.
They didn't think there was enough wrong with me.
- [Stops]
- Well, did they check everything?
Yes.
They even touched my Charlie Browns.
You lied to me.
- You said I wasn't fit to serve.
- Okay, hold on.
Let's calm down, people.
Um, I think I know a little bit about avoiding combat duty.
Now which pinkie do you use less?
Are you nuts?
Do you know what I went through to have this boy?
Oh, I know where the boy came from.
Wait.
Why were you in the pantry?
And Lucille realized it was time to end... whatever it was she had with Oscar.
So, I believe it's a good plan.
The next day, Michael was ready to wow the board with his new business model.
As I told my brother, the president... if we start construction on a second model home... we can be cutting this ribbon within two months.
I said, "That's why you're no longer president."
Two weeks.
Let's do it in two weeks.
Hey!
[Stagy]
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Can we stop the music?
- [Stops]
- I'm not as optimistic that we can get that done.
Gob, I think we both agree that we would do things your way... if you had a business model.
Do you have a business model, Gob?
I am so happy that you asked me that, Michael... because I just happen to have a business model right here.
[Resumes] Solid as a rock
Meet Starla, the new Bluth Company business model... for our phase two campaign.
Bluth Homes:
Solid as a rock.
We'll see you at the ribbon-cutting in two weeks... if my brother doesn't screw it up first.
- Hey!
[Narrator] Gob had committed Michael to building a model home in two weeks.
We can't build a house in two weeks.
Also, I'm not sure how "Solid as a Rock"... helps people forget the fact that we built houses in Iraq.
- I love that.
- But you probably know best because you're president.
We don't have to build a real house, Michael.
Like you said, it's all for appearances anyway.
We throw up a couple of walls.
- We build a fake one.
- What are you talking about?
Nothing on the inside.
I'll never get a crew to build it.
They'd lose their licenses.
Then you build it yourself, damn it!
Hey, there she is, my little business model.
Sorry about that "build it yourself' crap.
I might take her to the ribbon-cutting.
- You end up finding a date yet?
- No.
[Narrator] As Michael grew frustrated by his relationship with Gob...
Lucille tried to end hers with Oscar.
- I want you out of the house.
- Oh, I want you everywhere.
Oscar, no.
I can't have this in my life anymore.
I'm a married woman.
Lucille, you wanna leave?
I won't chase after you.
But before you do, ask yourself, "Where's your husband?"
Because I am here.
I am real.
I am flesh and blood.
And hair.
Oh, God, that hair.
[Sighs]
What will people say?
They'll say, "Those people are in love."
[Hat Crunches]
[Narrator] That night, the evening news report said something very different.
[Man] Lucille Bluth, caught on tape breathing life into a homeless man.
The surprising home video at 10:00.
[Narrator] And Michael prepared to build a house.
Two weeks?
But what if my date's not available?
I'm trying to get a last-minute crew together.
Your inability to get a man interested...
- is not at the top of my list.
- Oh, I've got a man interested, Michael.
- What's wrong with him?
- There's nothing wrong with him.
He is homeless.
Well, I didn't know he was homeless at the time.
- It was humiliating.
- Is this about Gangy's homeless guy?
- Gangy's homeless guy?
- Yeah, it's all over the news.
Gangy gave C.P.R. To a homeless guy on the beach.
[Narrator] Lindsay felt respect for her mother... and decided that perhaps she could overcome her pride and help someone too.
I've got someone for your crew, Michael.
My boyfriend, the homeless guy.
- I wonder if he even has an apartment or- - [Phone Ringing]
- Hello.
- [Lucille On Phone] Did you see the news?
Your Uncle Oscar forced himself on me at the beach today...
- and I didn't have my horn.
- Of course.
It was Uncle Oscar.
Mom, you're not having an affair with him, are you?
You're building a house?
I want you to give it to him.
- It's not a real house.
- Perfect.
He's not a real man.
[Narrator] And George Sr. Made his case to the Mexican police.
My God, I was beaten up here.
I'm telling you.
I'm George.
I'm not Oscar.
I'm George.
- The Cornballer.
- Ssí.
The Cornballer.
[Narrator] George Sr. Had marketed a device called the Cornballer in Mexico... after the severe burns it caused led to it being banned in the U.S.
- Why, did you have one?
- Ssí.
[Narrator] Lindsay, meanwhile, was having trouble finding her homeless man.
- He looked like a movie star.
- The man looked like a movie star because he was a movie star.
His name was Tom Jane, and he was making two movies for a major studio.
One was a gritty personal project about a junkie's life... which he got to do in exchange for making... a rigidly, formulaic popcorn movie.

I was so grossed out when I found out you were gross before.
You really thought I was gross, huh?
Well, at first, I thought you were kind of hot, but I hadn't looked closely enough.
Listen, I have a construction job for you.
And if you clean yourself up, who knows?
You might actually get a date out of this.
- Okay.
- See ya.
Okay, we've all made some sacrifices to be here, but we all want the same thing.
- I wanna live here.
- I wanna buy Ann some diamond dust.
I'm just hoping to get mildly injured, so I can get out of the army.
Bottom line is we've got two weeks to build a house.
It doesn't have to be good.
It just has to look good.
I just want my kids back.
[Narrator] And so, the guys went to work.
- [Grunting] - [Chattering]
[Narrator] Things didn't go smoothly at first.
Buster looked for ways to hurt himself.
But soon the project came together- when Gob stopped by.
Now we're building a house.
- Yeah, I'm pretty proud-
- So, what do you think?
Did I do this or what?
Seems like your brother did it.
My brother does what I tell him to do.
I'm the president.
Where's your "P"?
What?
Oh, no, not again.
- I got it.
- [Groans]
Hey, sorry for the "my brother does what I tell him to do" crap... but I want this to be perfect for when I cut the ribbon tomorrow.
You're cutting the ribbon?
I kinda thought that since I built it...
- I might go ahead and give it a-
- Yeah, okay.
Can you imagine how that would look to the board?
The construction worker cutting the ribbon.
No, no, that's a job for the president.
[Narrator] Michael had a problem with that.
- Gob had taken away something Michael always wanted.
- You got the "P."
Now it was Michael's turn to take something from Gob
- Starla.
And later, Michael set about his plan.
Gob, do you have Starla's phone number?
I got a few business things I'd like to go over with the business model.
Guess who was just over her?
Don't, I'll tell you- me.
- Hmm?
- L- [Bleeps] the business model.
[Narrator] Actually, theyjust made out.
Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms.
Imagine that.
I finally nailed somebody that you weren't after.
That's it.
I've worked too hard and too long for you to keep getting all the credit.
I built that company, that house, and I'm gonna be cutting the ribbon... whether we're all pretending that you're president or not.
Yeah, sure.
I just wanted-
- You just wanted what?
- I just wanted you to be impressed with me.
Dad never was.
Never said a nice thing about me.
He called you the other day.
He didn't even wanna talk to me.
Of course he did!
He never wants to talk to me.
He never has.
- Cut the ribbon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
How about that?
- Michael.
I have no problem with it.
- All right?
Take it easy.
Come on.
- Thank you.
[Narrator] The next day, the Bluth family prepared to unveil phase two.
- [Rock]
- Have you seen your Uncle Gob around?
No.
And I can't find that diamond dust that Aunt Lindsay bought for me.
Oh, well, your Aunt Lindsay has probably taken it.
She's just a taker.
This is your chance, huh?
With the big ribbon-cutters after all these years?
Well, actually, I figured, give Gob a chance, you know?
The guy doesn't get a whole lot of attention in this family.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the Bluth Company, Gob Bluth.
My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done.
But I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done"... for an answer.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you phase two of the Bluth Company.
- A house truly solid as a rock.
- [Music]
- [House Creaking] - [Narrator] But as it turns out...
Michael was right to not be optimistic it could be done.
[Women Screaming]
[Narrator] And Buster saw the chance to get injured enough... to keep him out of the army.
- [Whimpers, Screams]
- But instead...
- got a glimpse inside.
- [Buster] I can't look at that.
[Narrator] Unfortunately, Tobias had to.
I got the wrong homeless man.
I am sorry.
I was looking for Lindsay.
You lied to me.
You both lied to me.
I'm goin'to war.
- Buster, you can't!
- Yes, I can.
I don't agree with your dirty doings here... but I will defend with my life your right to do it.
You planned this all along, didn't you, Michael?
- No, I didn't.
I had no crew.
I had no time.
- You set me up.
[Narrator] Gob charged at Michael with the scissors... but Michael, as he always did, picked rock-
- You wanted to make me look foolish!
- Put down the scissors.
- Put 'em down.
- Foolish with scissors!
[Narrator] Which beat scissors.
Unfortunately, the whole incident was covered by the paper.
Nobody looks good in this.
- Especially that little dude.
- That's Ann.
- Who's-
- It doesn't matter.
Listen.
You know I didn't set you up, okay?
I think the only reason you and I always fight... is that since we were little kids, Dad's always played us off each other.
Dad always said that was your fault.
Anyway, what we oughta do is make a decision right now... not to let Dad get in the middle of our relationship anymore.
- He's not even in town, and we're fighting.
- We're grown men.
- Yeah, let's just move on.
- Look at me.
I'm the president of a company now.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Oh, that's Dad's line.
I bet he saw the paper.
Listen, if you want my respect, you won't answer that, okay?
It's just gonna cause more problems.
[Rings, Disconnects]
Hello?
They hung up.
They hung up on me.
Hiya, guys.
I couldn't get the money.
I don't know what happened.
- I'm impressed you hung up.
- Did I hang up?
- I meant to hit speaker.
- Oh.
- You gotta hit the line first.
- I'm hitting both at the same time.
- These are the lines.
There's a line here.
- But she said-
- It's line and then-
- Hey.
I don't wanna wait until Dad's dead for us to get along.
[Narrator] But it was too late... as George Sr. Would be declared dead... within the hour.
- From now on, we support each other.
- We start with a clean slate.
- Yeah.
- We almost did it though, didn't we?
We almost pulled it off.
- No, it wasn't even close.
- Yeah, a lot of people got hurt.
- This was very, very bad.
- Not great.
Not great.
[Narrator] On the next Arrested Development.
Lindsay finds out the true identity ofher homeless man.
Look.
You're a really nice chick, but I'm not homeless.
I'm Tom Jane.
And even though Lindsay doesn't know who that is... hearing that he isn't homeless is good enough for her.
- Buy me a drink?
- You're really sweet, but, no.
I'm Tom Jane.
[Narrator] And Lindsay, crushed and alone... for the first time misses her husband.
- Tobias.
- [Man Singing]
Lindsay, I'm-
Is that George Michael's diamond cream?
Oh, yes, well, I ran out of blue, and I couldn't find anything else.
I think my nipples are bleeding though.
I don't know if you're supposed to use quite this much.
[Continues]
- That guy's a jerk.
- No, I am.
No, no, I am.
Because I think I need to go to the hospital right away... and see if I can't get some of this diamond dust vacuumed from out of my lungs.
This way.
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything... and the one son who had no choice... but to keep them all together.
It's Arrested Development.
Michael Bluth was at home working on a plan to save the company.
How's this for a business model?
We make the company look like it's in the black... by starting construction on the phase two development.
I know what you're thinking, we're not in the black.
How're we gonna build 30 houses without any money?
We don't.
We build one- then we have a huge ribbon-cutting ceremony while raising funds for the others.
Michael's father always unveiled his construction projects... with a highly publicized ribbon-cutting ceremony.
He even did so for the prison he built... and, somewhat ironically, would later occupy.
The only difference is this time I get to cut the ribbon.
What do you think?
There's a cream with real diamonds in it.
I can actually smear diamonds on my face, and it's only $400 a tub.
That's like, what, like a million diamonds for $400?
- Mm.
- A million- diamonds.
- Okay.
- Is she on you about that diamond cream?
My husband's jealous because since we decided to have an open marriage...
I've been doing a little better than he has.
It is not a competition, Lindsay.
We are doing this to save our marriage.
But I should be telling you that I have been meeting my fair share of groupies.
Or should I say "Bluepies"?
Tobias had recently auditioned as an understudy... for the silent performance art trio, the Blue Man Group.
And this is "Kids" from Bye, Bye, Birdie.
He had yet to hear back from them.
You guys really think you have the guts to go through with this "seeing other people" thing?
In fact, neither Lindsay nor Tobias did have the guts to go through with it.
- I already have.
- I have too.
Can I buy you a drink?
No.
- Lindsay, because she'd lost her self-confidence.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Where's she going?
And Tobias, because he was busy keeping an eye on Lindsay.
Who are you gonna bring to this ribbon-cutting dance?
It's not a dance, and you don't need a date.
Although, George Michael...
I'd love for you to come with me when I cut the ribbon at the new house.
Oh, wow.
Hey, can I bring Ann?
Who?
Ann.
You know, she's- she's the girl I'm kinda hanging out with.
- I haven't met Ann.
- Yes, you have.
- Michael had met Ann.
- You let her in.
See, that's her right over there.
- Oh, Ann.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.
I know Ann.
Hey, you!
She's got a little hard-boiled egg going there.
Oh, it's so cute.
She sometimes takes a little pack of mayonnaise... and she'll squirt it in her mouth, and then she'll take an egg... and kind of- mmm.
She calls it a mayonn-egg.
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel so good.
You know, I kind of wanna buy her a diamond.
- Her?
- Ann.
I know I can't afford it, but Aunt Lindsay was telling me about this diamond cream.
George Michael, um, I'm sure that Egg is a very nice person.
I just don't want you spending-
- It's Ann.
Her na- - all your money getting her all glittered up for Easter.
You know?
More importantly, I want us to do this together.
Kinda like a father-son sort of thing, you know?
And since Pop-Pop is no longer president, we get to do it.
- I thought Gob was president.
- Yeah, and I don't have any problem with that.
In fact, since Michael's father escaped from prison... his brother Gob had been made president, albeit in name only.
Which is why Michael was surprised when he got to work the next day.
- You're still in my office.
- Gosh, Michael, I am kind of the president.
And I have no problem with that.
But it is just a title, remember?
Just doing this to appease the stockholders, while they scrutinize me for Dad's crimes.
Hey, Dad may have illegally built some homes in Iraq, which is kinda not cool.
I know, but that's why I've got a business model... that I think is going to restore the image of our company.
We're going to build a second model home.
That's great.
Can I announce it to the board?
Gee, it is my business model.
If you had a business model, then by all means, go in there and do your little dance.
Tell you what we're gonna do.
Rock, paper, scissors for it.
- No, no, I'm not interested in doing-
- One, two, three.
- Paper covers rock.
- It is a rock though.
It should beat everything.
There's not a lot of logic to it.
It's like on a boat with "Women and children first."
Why should they-which, before I forget, I'm buying a company boat.
Sorry?
That morning, Gob had gone to a boat show, where he saw something he wanted.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- What a beauty.
- Thank you.
- I meant you.
- Well.
Gob flirted with her for a while, and finally asked for her number.
- Let's get some digits.
- I'm sorry.
I don't give it out without a firm offer.
Oh, I'll make you a firm offer.
Unfortunately, she wasn't flirting.
And here again, please.
- The Seaward.
- You're not getting a boat.
- One, two, three.
- No, not gonna do it.
- Paper covers rock.
- Fine.
But rock sinks boat.
- Michael?
- Mom, I'm right in the middle of something.
- Get rid of the Seaward.
- I'll leave when I'm good and ready.
It's about your Uncle Oscar.
I want him to move in with you.
You're not kicking him out already, are you?
Michael's uncle had recently moved into Lucille's apartment... where they quickly rekindled a long-dormant romance.
- It was a secret she hoped to keep-
- Oscar, we'll be heard.
- and he didn't.
- That's what makes it so hot.
Mother?
Mother!
- I heard zoo noises.
- It's nothing.
Go back to bed.
So, everybody's still up, huh?
It's not fair to Buster.
He's a nervous wreck right now.
He's going into the army, for God's sake.
You volunteered him.
I knew you were going to throw that in my face.
Don't worry about it, okay?
They're never gonna take him anyway.
At that moment, Buster was taking his physical at the recruitment center.
I don't have a hole in my heart.
I've never opened my eyes underwater.
My- Reproductive organ... is shaped like- a lobster tail... but without its shell, hmm?
Oh, I guess I have the panic attacks under control.
Oh, and I'm legally blind at night.
But Buster had miscalculated the army's current need for personnel.
Okay, then, let's get you fitted for a uniform.
What?
What?
Hey, why don't you volunteer Oscar?
That would solve both of your problems.
He'd never cut his hair.
That hair.
Listen, Oscar's your problem.
I'm taking care of everything else in this family... including starting construction on a second model home.
We're having a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
We can't have a ribbon-cutting without your father, and he's God knows where.
George Sr. Was in Mexico... with his escape accomplice and ex-secretary, Kitty.
I keep eating so many eggs.
It must be my unconscious desire to have a baby.
Oh, my God.
Can you even imagine how cute the combination of the two of us would be?
I mean, we're all out of "prophylacticos" anyway.
Somebody used the last two on his feet to walk across the bathroom floor.
But he was growing tired of their confined intimacy.
- I've made a huge mistake.
- Hey, it's me.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
Listen, I gotta make this quick.
You're the only one who can save the family, but you gotta keep the company strong... because I'm gonna need some of that money later.
I will, Dad.
It's funny, after all these years of...
- you making fun of me for the magic shows and-
- Gob!
Oh, for God's
- I called to talk to Michael, you horse's-
- Gob was hurt.
- Bye, Pop.
Hey, whoa, whoa, was that Dad?
Yeah, I had to, uh, jump off.
You just had Dad on the phone?
Where was he?
No way to tell, really.
Portugal.
- Down South America way.
- Well, did he wanna talk to me?
No, he wanted to talk to the president.
- I have no problem with that.
- Michael was also hurt.
And George Sr. Was brutally hurt... when he was mistaken for his twin brother Oscar.
Marijuana?
No, no.
That's my brother.
"Brothero.
Brothero."
That night, Lindsay headed to the club... to try again to meet someone.
Soon, having struck out again, she spotted a man who looked interesting.
He had the lean look, effortless hair... and dressed-down manner of a movie star.
- Buy me a drink?
- I think the bar's closing.
I know a place.
It was at that point that Lindsay had a startling revelation.
Uh, uh, uh, you get out.
Get out.
Get out.
Out, out, out!
- No homeless in here!
- Homeless?
You're homeless?
You're gross.
Oh, God.
They're taking me in the army.
They didn't think there was enough wrong with me.
Well, did they check everything?
Yes.
They even touched my Charlie Browns.
You lied to me.
- You said I wasn't fit to serve.
- Okay, hold on.
Let's calm down, people.
Um, I think I know a little bit about avoiding combat duty.
Now which pinkie do you use less?
Are you nuts?
Do you know what I went through to have this boy?
Oh, I know where the boy came from.
Wait.
Why were you in the pantry?
And Lucille realized it was time to end... whatever it was she had with Oscar.
So, I believe it's a good plan.
The next day, Michael was ready to wow the board with his new business model.
As I told my brother, the president... if we start construction on a second model home... we can be cutting this ribbon within two months.
I said, "That's why you're no longer president."
Two weeks.
Let's do it in two weeks.
Hey!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Can we stop the music?
I'm not as optimistic that we can get that done.
Gob, I think we both agree that we would do things your way... if you had a business model.
Do you have a business model, Gob?
I am so happy that you asked me that, Michael... because I just happen to have a business model right here.
Solid as a rock
Meet Starla, the new Bluth Company business model... for our phase two campaign.
Solid as a rock.
We'll see you at the ribbon-cutting in two weeks... if my brother doesn't screw it up first.
- Hey!
Gob had committed Michael to building a model home in two weeks.
We can't build a house in two weeks.
Also, I'm not sure how "Solid as a Rock"... helps people forget the fact that we built houses in Iraq.
- I love that.
- But you probably know best because you're president.
We don't have to build a real house, Michael.
Like you said, it's all for appearances anyway.
We throw up a couple of walls.
- We build a fake one.
- What are you talking about?
Nothing on the inside.
I'll never get a crew to build it.
They'd lose their licenses.
Then you build it yourself, damn it!
Hey, there she is, my little business model.
Sorry about that "build it yourself' crap.
I might take her to the ribbon-cutting.
- You end up finding a date yet?
- No.
As Michael grew frustrated by his relationship with Gob...
Lucille tried to end hers with Oscar.
- I want you out of the house.
- Oh, I want you everywhere.
Oscar, no.
I can't have this in my life anymore.
I'm a married woman.
Lucille, you wanna leave?
I won't chase after you.
But before you do, ask yourself, "Where's your husband?"
Because I am here.
I am real.
I am flesh and blood.
And hair.
Oh, God, that hair.
What will people say?
They'll say, "Those people are in love."
That night, the evening news report said something very different.
Lucille Bluth, caught on tape breathing life into a homeless man.
The surprising home video at 10:00.
And Michael prepared to build a house.
Two weeks?
But what if my date's not available?
I'm trying to get a last-minute crew together.
Your inability to get a man interested...
- is not at the top of my list.
- Oh, I've got a man interested, Michael.
- What's wrong with him?
- There's nothing wrong with him.
He is homeless.
Well, I didn't know he was homeless at the time.
- It was humiliating.
- Is this about Gangy's homeless guy?
- Gangy's homeless guy?
- Yeah, it's all over the news.
Gangy gave C.P.R. To a homeless guy on the beach.
Lindsay felt respect for her mother... and decided that perhaps she could overcome her pride and help someone too.
I've got someone for your crew, Michael.
My boyfriend, the homeless guy.
I wonder if he even has an apartment or-
- Hello.
- Did you see the news?
Your Uncle Oscar forced himself on me at the beach today...
- and I didn't have my horn.
- Of course.
It was Uncle Oscar.
Mom, you're not having an affair with him, are you?
You're building a house?
I want you to give it to him.
- It's not a real house.
- Perfect.
He's not a real man.
And George Sr. Made his case to the Mexican police.
My God, I was beaten up here.
I'm telling you.
I'm George.
I'm not Oscar.
I'm George.
- The Cornballer.
- Ssí.
The Cornballer.
George Sr. Had marketed a device called the Cornballer in Mexico... after the severe burns it caused led to it being banned in the U.S.
- Why, did you have one?
- Ssí.
Lindsay, meanwhile, was having trouble finding her homeless man.
- He looked like a movie star.
- The man looked like a movie star because he was a movie star.
His name was Tom Jane, and he was making two movies for a major studio.
One was a gritty personal project about a junkie's life... which he got to do in exchange for making... a rigidly, formulaic popcorn movie.
- He was living on the streets, researching his role.
- Hey, homeless guy.
- Hey.
- I'm not proud of the way...
I was so grossed out when I found out you were gross before.
You really thought I was gross, huh?
Well, at first, I thought you were kind of hot, but I hadn't looked closely enough.
Listen, I have a construction job for you.
And if you clean yourself up, who knows?
You might actually get a date out of this.
- Okay.
- See ya.
Okay, we've all made some sacrifices to be here, but we all want the same thing.
- I wanna live here.
- I wanna buy Ann some diamond dust.
I'm just hoping to get mildly injured, so I can get out of the army.
Bottom line is we've got two weeks to build a house.
It doesn't have to be good.
It just has to look good.
I just want my kids back.
And so, the guys went to work.
Things didn't go smoothly at first.
Buster looked for ways to hurt himself.
But soon the project came together- when Gob stopped by.
Now we're building a house.
- Yeah, I'm pretty proud-
- So, what do you think?
Did I do this or what?
Seems like your brother did it.
My brother does what I tell him to do.
I'm the president.
Where's your "P"?
What?
Oh, no, not again.
I got it.
Hey, sorry for the "my brother does what I tell him to do" crap... but I want this to be perfect for when I cut the ribbon tomorrow.
You're cutting the ribbon?
I kinda thought that since I built it...
- I might go ahead and give it a-
- Yeah, okay.
Can you imagine how that would look to the board?
The construction worker cutting the ribbon.
No, no, that's a job for the president.
Michael had a problem with that.
- Gob had taken away something Michael always wanted.
- You got the "P."
Now it was Michael's turn to take something from Gob
- Starla.
And later, Michael set about his plan.
Gob, do you have Starla's phone number?
I got a few business things I'd like to go over with the business model.
Guess who was just over her?
Don't, I'll tell you- me.
- Hmm?
- L- the business model.
Actually, theyjust made out.
Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms.
Imagine that.
I finally nailed somebody that you weren't after.
That's it.
I've worked too hard and too long for you to keep getting all the credit.
I built that company, that house, and I'm gonna be cutting the ribbon... whether we're all pretending that you're president or not.
Yeah, sure.
I just wanted-
- You just wanted what?
- I just wanted you to be impressed with me.
Dad never was.
Never said a nice thing about me.
He called you the other day.
He didn't even wanna talk to me.
Of course he did!
He never wants to talk to me.
He never has.
- Cut the ribbon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
How about that?
- Michael.
I have no problem with it.
- All right?
Take it easy.
Come on.
- Thank you.
The next day, the Bluth family prepared to unveil phase two.
Have you seen your Uncle Gob around?
No.
And I can't find that diamond dust that Aunt Lindsay bought for me.
Oh, well, your Aunt Lindsay has probably taken it.
She's just a taker.

Unfortunately, Tobias had to.
I got the wrong homeless man.

You lied to me.
You both lied to me.
I'm goin'to war.
- Buster, you can't!
- Yes, I can.
I don't agree with your dirty doings here... but I will defend with my life your right to do it.
You planned this all along, didn't you, Michael?
- No, I didn't.
I had no crew.
I had no time.
- You set me up.
Gob charged at Michael with the scissors... but Michael, as he always did, picked rock-
- You wanted to make me look foolish!
- Put down the scissors.
- Put 'em down.
- Foolish with scissors!
Which beat scissors.

I'm the president of a company now.
Oh, that's Dad's line.
I bet he saw the paper.
Listen, if you want my respect, you won't answer that, okay?
It's just gonna cause more problems.
Hello?
They hung up.
They hung up on me.
Hiya, guys.
I couldn't get the money.
I don't know what happened.
- I'm impressed you hung up.
- Did I hang up?

The only difference is this time I get to cut the ribbon.
What do you think?
There's a cream with real diamonds in it.
I can actually smear diamonds on my face, and it's only $400 a tub.
That's like, what, like a million diamonds for $400?
- Mm.
- A million- diamonds.
- Okay.
- Is she on you about that diamond cream?
My husband's jealous because since we decided to have an open marriage...
I've been doing a little better than he has.
It is not a competition, Lindsay.
We are doing this to save our marriage.
But I should be telling you that I have been meeting my fair share of groupies.
Or should I say "Bluepies"?
Tobias had recently auditioned as an understudy... for the silent performance art trio, the Blue Man Group.
And this is "Kids" from Bye, Bye, Birdie.
He had yet to hear back from them.
You guys really think you have the guts to go through with this "seeing other people" thing?
In fact, neither Lindsay nor Tobias did have the guts to go through with it.
- I already have.
- I have too.
Can I buy you a drink?
No.
- Lindsay, because she'd lost her self-confidence.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Where's she going?
And Tobias, because he was busy keeping an eye on Lindsay.
Who are you gonna bring to this ribbon-cutting dance?
It's not a dance, and you don't need a date.
Although, George Michael...
I'd love for you to come with me when I cut the ribbon at the new house.
Oh, wow.
Hey, can I bring Ann?
Who?
Ann.
You know, she's- she's the girl I'm kinda hanging out with.
- I haven't met Ann.
- Yes, you have.
- Michael had met Ann.
- You let her in.
See, that's her right over there.
- Oh, Ann.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.
I know Ann.
Hey, you!
She's got a little hard-boiled egg going there.
Oh, it's so cute.
She sometimes takes a little pack of mayonnaise... and she'll squirt it in her mouth, and then she'll take an egg... and kind of- mmm.
She calls it a mayonn-egg.
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel so good.
You know, I kind of wanna buy her a diamond.
- Her?
- Ann.
I know I can't afford it, but Aunt Lindsay was telling me about this diamond cream.
George Michael, um, I'm sure that Egg is a very nice person.
I just don't want you spending-
- It's Ann.
Her na- - all your money getting her all glittered up for Easter.
You know?
More importantly, I want us to do this together.
Kinda like a father-son sort of thing, you know?
And since Pop-Pop is no longer president, we get to do it.
- I thought Gob was president.
- Yeah, and I don't have any problem with that.
In fact, since Michael's father escaped from prison... his brother Gob had been made president, albeit in name only.
Which is why Michael was surprised when he got to work the next day.
- You're still in my office.
- Gosh, Michael, I am kind of the president.
And I have no problem with that.
But it is just a title, remember?
Just doing this to appease the stockholders, while they scrutinize me for Dad's crimes.
Hey, Dad may have illegally built some homes in Iraq, which is kinda not cool.
I know, but that's why I've got a business model... that I think is going to restore the image of our company.
We're going to build a second model home.
That's great.
Can I announce it to the board?
Gee, it is my business model.
If you had a business model, then by all means, go in there and do your little dance.
Tell you what we're gonna do.
Rock, paper, scissors for it.
- No, no, I'm not interested in doing-
- One, two, three.
- Paper covers rock.
- It is a rock though.
It should beat everything.
There's not a lot of logic to it.
It's like on a boat with "Women and children first. "
Why should they-which, before I forget, I'm buying a company boat.
Sorry?
That morning, Gob had gone to a boat show, where he saw something he wanted.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- What a beauty.
- Thank you.
- I meant you.
- Well.
Gob flirted with her for a while, and finally asked for her number.
- Let's get some digits.
- I'm sorry.
I don't give it out without a firm offer.
Oh, I'll make you a firm offer.
Unfortunately, she wasn't flirting.
And here again, please.
- The Seaward.
- You're not getting a boat.
- One, two, three.
- No, not gonna do it.
- Paper covers rock.
- Fine.
But rock sinks boat.
- Michael?
- Mom, I'm right in the middle of something.
- Get rid of the Seaward.
- I'll leave when I'm good and ready.
It's about your Uncle Oscar.
I want him to move in with you.
You're not kicking him out already, are you?
Michael's uncle had recently moved into Lucille's apartment... where they quickly rekindled a long-dormant romance.
- It was a secret she hoped to keep-
- Oscar, we'll be heard.
- and he didn't.
- That's what makes it so hot.
Mother?
Mother!
- I heard zoo noises.
- It's nothing.
Go back to bed.
So, everybody's still up, huh?
It's not fair to Buster.
He's a nervous wreck right now.
He's going into the army, for God's sake.
You volunteered him.
I knew you were going to throw that in my face.
Don't worry about it, okay?
They're never gonna take him anyway.
At that moment, Buster was taking his physical at the recruitment center.
I don't have a hole in my heart.
I've never opened my eyes underwater.
My- Reproductive organ... is shaped like- a lobster tail... but without its shell, hmm?
Oh, I guess I have the panic attacks under control.
Oh, and I'm legally blind at night.
But Buster had miscalculated the army's current need for personnel.
Okay, then, let's get you fitted for a uniform.
What?
What?
Hey, why don't you volunteer Oscar?
That would solve both of your problems.
He'd never cut his hair.
That hair.
Listen, Oscar's your problem.
I'm taking care of everything else in this family... including starting construction on a second model home.
We're having a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
We can't have a ribbon-cutting without your father, and he's God knows where.
George Sr. Was in Mexico... with his escape accomplice and ex-secretary, Kitty.
I keep eating so many eggs.
It must be my unconscious desire to have a baby.
Oh, my God.
Can you even imagine how cute the combination of the two of us would be?
I mean, we're all out of "prophylacticos" anyway.
Somebody used the last two on his feet to walk across the bathroom floor.
But he was growing tired of their confined intimacy.
- I've made a huge mistake.
- Hey, it's me.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
Listen, I gotta make this quick.
You're the only one who can save the family, but you gotta keep the company strong... because I'm gonna need some of that money later.
I will, Dad.
It's funny, after all these years of...
- you making fun of me for the magic shows and-
- Gob!
Oh, for God's
- I called to talk to Michael, you horse's-
- Gob was hurt.
- Bye, Pop.
Hey, whoa, whoa, was that Dad?
Yeah, I had to, uh, jump off.
You just had Dad on the phone?
Where was he?
No way to tell, really.
Portugal.
- Down South America way.
- Well, did he wanna talk to me?
No, he wanted to talk to the president.
- I have no problem with that.
- Michael was also hurt.
And George Sr. Was brutally hurt... when he was mistaken for his twin brother Oscar.
Marijuana?
No, no.
That's my brother.
"Brothero.
Brothero. "
That night, Lindsay headed to the club... to try again to meet someone.
Soon, having struck out again, she spotted a man who looked interesting.
He had the lean look, effortless hair... and dressed-down manner of a movie star.
- Buy me a drink?
- I think the bar's closing.
I know a place.
It was at that point that Lindsay had a startling revelation.
Uh, uh, uh, you get out.
Get out.
Get out.
Out, out, out!
- No homeless in here!
- Homeless?
You're homeless?
You're gross.
Oh, God.
They're taking me in the army.
They didn't think there was enough wrong with me.
Well, did they check everything?
Yes.
They even touched my Charlie Browns.
You lied to me.
- You said I wasn't fit to serve.
- Okay, hold on.
Let's calm down, people.
Um, I think I know a little bit about avoiding combat duty.
Now which pinkie do you use less?
Are you nuts?
Do you know what I went through to have this boy?
Oh, I know where the boy came from.
Wait.
Why were you in the pantry?
And Lucille realized it was time to end... whatever it was she had with Oscar.
So, I believe it's a good plan.
The next day, Michael was ready to wow the board with his new business model.
As I told my brother, the president... if we start construction on a second model home... we can be cutting this ribbon within two months.
I said, "That's why you're no longer president. "
Two weeks.
Let's do it in two weeks.
Hey!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Can we stop the music?
I'm not as optimistic that we can get that done.
Gob, I think we both agree that we would do things your way... if you had a business model.
Do you have a business model, Gob?
I am so happy that you asked me that, Michael... because I just happen to have a business model right here.
Solid as a rock
Meet Starla, the new Bluth Company business model... for our phase two campaign.
Solid as a rock.
We'll see you at the ribbon-cutting in two weeks... if my brother doesn't screw it up first.
- Hey!
Gob had committed Michael to building a model home in two weeks.
We can't build a house in two weeks.
Also, I'm not sure how "Solid as a Rock"... helps people forget the fact that we built houses in Iraq.
- I love that.
- But you probably know best because you're president.
We don't have to build a real house, Michael.
Like you said, it's all for appearances anyway.
We throw up a couple of walls.
- We build a fake one.
- What are you talking about?
Nothing on the inside.
I'll never get a crew to build it.
They'd lose their licenses.
Then you build it yourself, damn it!
Hey, there she is, my little business model.
Sorry about that "build it yourself' crap.
I might take her to the ribbon-cutting.
- You end up finding a date yet?
- No.
As Michael grew frustrated by his relationship with Gob...
Lucille tried to end hers with Oscar.
- I want you out of the house.
- Oh, I want you everywhere.
Oscar, no.
I can't have this in my life anymore.
I'm a married woman.
Lucille, you wanna leave?
I won't chase after you.
But before you do, ask yourself, "Where's your husband?"
Because I am here.
I am real.
I am flesh and blood.
And hair.
Oh, God, that hair.
What will people say?
They'll say, "Those people are in love. "
That night, the evening news report said something very different.
Lucille Bluth, caught on tape breathing life into a homeless man.
The surprising home video at 10:00.
And Michael prepared to build a house.
Two weeks?
But what if my date's not available?
I'm trying to get a last-minute crew together.
Your inability to get a man interested...
- is not at the top of my list.
- Oh, I've got a man interested, Michael.
- What's wrong with him?
- There's nothing wrong with him.
He is homeless.
Well, I didn't know he was homeless at the time.
- It was humiliating.
- Is this about Gangy's homeless guy?
- Gangy's homeless guy?
- Yeah, it's all over the news.
Gangy gave C.P.R. To a homeless guy on the beach.
Lindsay felt respect for her mother... and decided that perhaps she could overcome her pride and help someone too.
I've got someone for your crew, Michael.
My boyfriend, the homeless guy.
I wonder if he even has an apartment or-
- Hello.
- Did you see the news?
Your Uncle Oscar forced himself on me at the beach today...
- and I didn't have my horn.
- Of course.
It was Uncle Oscar.
Mom, you're not having an affair with him, are you?
You're building a house?
I want you to give it to him.
- It's not a real house.
- Perfect.
He's not a real man.
And George Sr. Made his case to the Mexican police.
My God, I was beaten up here.
I'm telling you.
I'm George.
I'm not Oscar.
I'm George.
- The Cornballer.
- Ssí.
The Cornballer.
George Sr. Had marketed a device called the Cornballer in Mexico... after the severe burns it caused led to it being banned in the U.S.
- Why, did you have one?
- Ssí.
Lindsay, meanwhile, was having trouble finding her homeless man.
- He looked like a movie star.
- The man looked like a movie star because he was a movie star.
His name was Tom Jane, and he was making two movies for a major studio.
One was a gritty personal project about a junkie's life... which he got to do in exchange for making... a rigidly, formulaic popcorn movie.
- He was living on the streets, researching his role.
- Hey, homeless guy.
- Hey.
- I'm not proud of the way...
I was so grossed out when I found out you were gross before.
You really thought I was gross, huh?
Well, at first, I thought you were kind of hot, but I hadn't looked closely enough.
Listen, I have a construction job for you.
And if you clean yourself up, who knows?
You might actually get a date out of this.
- Okay.
- See ya.
Okay, we've all made some sacrifices to be here, but we all want the same thing.
- I wanna live here.
- I wanna buy Ann some diamond dust.
I'm just hoping to get mildly injured, so I can get out of the army.
Bottom line is we've got two weeks to build a house.
It doesn't have to be good.
It just has to look good.
I just want my kids back.
And so, the guys went to work.
Things didn't go smoothly at first.
Buster looked for ways to hurt himself.
But soon the project came together- when Gob stopped by.
Now we're building a house.
- Yeah, I'm pretty proud-
- So, what do you think?
Did I do this or what?
Seems like your brother did it.
My brother does what I tell him to do.
I'm the president.
Where's your "P"?
What?
Oh, no, not again.
I got it.
Hey, sorry for the "my brother does what I tell him to do" crap... but I want this to be perfect for when I cut the ribbon tomorrow.
You're cutting the ribbon?
I kinda thought that since I built it...
- I might go ahead and give it a-
- Yeah, okay.
Can you imagine how that would look to the board?
The construction worker cutting the ribbon.
No, no, that's a job for the president.
Michael had a problem with that.
- Gob had taken away something Michael always wanted.
- You got the "P."
Now it was Michael's turn to take something from Gob
- Starla.
And later, Michael set about his plan.
Gob, do you have Starla's phone number?
I got a few business things I'd like to go over with the business model.
Guess who was just over her?
Don't, I'll tell you- me.
- Hmm?
- L- the business model.
Actually, theyjust made out.
Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms.
Imagine that.
I finally nailed somebody that you weren't after.
That's it.
I've worked too hard and too long for you to keep getting all the credit.
I built that company, that house, and I'm gonna be cutting the ribbon... whether we're all pretending that you're president or not.
Yeah, sure.
I just wanted-
- You just wanted what?
- I just wanted you to be impressed with me.
Dad never was.
Never said a nice thing about me.
He called you the other day.
He didn't even wanna talk to me.
Of course he did!
He never wants to talk to me.
He never has.
- Cut the ribbon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
How about that?
- Michael.
I have no problem with it.
- All right?
Take it easy.
Come on.
- Thank you.
The next day, the Bluth family prepared to unveil phase two.
Have you seen your Uncle Gob around?
No.
And I can't find that diamond dust that Aunt Lindsay bought for me.
Oh, well, your Aunt Lindsay has probably taken it.
She's just a taker.
This is your chance, huh?
With the big ribbon-cutters after all these years?
Well, actually, I figured, give Gob a chance, you know?
The guy doesn't get a whole lot of attention in this family.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the Bluth Company, Gob Bluth.
My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done.
But I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done"... for an answer.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you phase two of the Bluth Company.
A house truly solid as a rock.
But as it turns out...
Michael was right to not be optimistic it could be done.
And Buster saw the chance to get injured enough... to keep him out of the army.
But instead...
- got a glimpse inside.
- I can't look at that.
Unfortunately, Tobias had to.
I got the wrong homeless man.
I am sorry.
I was looking for Lindsay.
You lied to me.
You both lied to me.
I'm goin'to war.
- Buster, you can't!
- Yes, I can.
I don't agree with your dirty doings here... but I will defend with my life your right to do it.
You planned this all along, didn't you, Michael?
- No, I didn't.
I had no crew.
I had no time.
- You set me up.
Gob charged at Michael with the scissors... but Michael, as he always did, picked rock-
- You wanted to make me look foolish!
- Put down the scissors.
- Put 'em down.
- Foolish with scissors!
Which beat scissors.
Unfortunately, the whole incident was covered by the paper.
Nobody looks good in this.
- Especially that little dude.
- That's Ann.
- Who's-
- It doesn't matter.
Listen.
You know I didn't set you up, okay?
I think the only reason you and I always fight... is that since we were little kids, Dad's always played us off each other.
Dad always said that was your fault.
Anyway, what we oughta do is make a decision right now... not to let Dad get in the middle of our relationship anymore.
- He's not even in town, and we're fighting.
- We're grown men.
- Yeah, let's just move on.
- Look at me.
I'm the president of a company now.
Oh, that's Dad's line.
I bet he saw the paper.
Listen, if you want my respect, you won't answer that, okay?
It's just gonna cause more problems.
Hello?
They hung up.
They hung up on me.
Hiya, guys.
I couldn't get the money.
I don't know what happened.
- I'm impressed you hung up.
- Did I hang up?
- I meant to hit speaker.
- Oh.
- You gotta hit the line first.
- I'm hitting both at the same time.
- These are the lines.
There's a line here.
- But she said-
- It's line and then-
- Hey.
I don't wanna wait until Dad's dead for us to get along.
But it was too late... as George Sr. Would be declared dead... within the hour.
- From now on, we support each other.
- We start with a clean slate.
- Yeah.
- We almost did it though, didn't we?
We almost pulled it off.
- No, it wasn't even close.
- Yeah, a lot of people got hurt.
- This was very, very bad.
- Not great.
Not great.
On the next Arrested Development.
Lindsay finds out the true identity ofher homeless man.
Look.
You're a really nice chick, but I'm not homeless.
I'm Tom Jane.
And even though Lindsay doesn't know who that is... hearing that he isn't homeless is good enough for her.
- Buy me a drink?
- You're really sweet, but, no.
I'm Tom Jane.
And Lindsay, crushed and alone... for the first time misses her husband.
Tobias.
Lindsay, I'm-
Is that George Michael's diamond cream?
Oh, yes, well, I ran out of blue, and I couldn't find anything else.
I think my nipples are bleeding though.
I don't know if you're supposed to use quite this much.
- That guy's a jerk.
- No, I am.
No, no, I am.
Because I think I need to go to the hospital right away... and see if I can't get some of this diamond dust vacuumed from out of my lungs.
This way.
Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything... and the one son who had no choice... but to keep them all together.
It's Arrested Development.
[Man Narrating] Michael Bluth was at home working on a plan to save the company.
How's this for a business model?
We make the company look like it's in the black... by starting construction on the phase two development.
I know what you're thinking, we're not in the black.
How're we gonna build 30 houses without any money?
We don't.
We build one- then we have a huge ribbon-cutting ceremony while raising funds for the others.
[Narrator] Michael's father always unveiled his construction projects... with a highly publicized ribbon-cutting ceremony.
He even did so for the prison he built... and, somewhat ironically, would later occupy.
The only difference is this time I get to cut the ribbon.
What do you think?
There's a cream with real diamonds in it.
I can actually smear diamonds on my face, and it's only $400 a tub.
That's like, what, like a million diamonds for $400?
- Mm.
- A million- [Bleeps] diamonds.
- Okay.
- Is she on you about that diamond cream?
My husband's jealous because since we decided to have an open marriage...
I've been doing a little better than he has.
It is not a competition, Lindsay.
We are doing this to save our marriage.
But I should be telling you that I have been meeting my fair share of groupies.
Or should I say "Bluepies"?
[Narrator] Tobias had recently auditioned as an understudy... for the silent performance art trio, the Blue Man Group.
- And this is "Kids" from Bye, Bye, Birdie.
- [Piano]
[Narrator] He had yet to hear back from them.
You guys really think you have the guts to go through with this "seeing other people" thing?
[Narrator] In fact, neither Lindsay nor Tobias did have the guts to go through with it.
- I already have.
- I have too.
Can I buy you a drink?
- No.
- [Narrator] Lindsay, because she'd lost her self-confidence.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Where's she going?
[Narrator] And Tobias, because he was busy keeping an eye on Lindsay.
Who are you gonna bring to this ribbon-cutting dance?
It's not a dance, and you don't need a date.
Although, George Michael...
I'd love for you to come with me when I cut the ribbon at the new house.
Oh, wow.
Hey, can I bring Ann?
Who?
Ann.
You know, she's- she's the girl I'm kinda hanging out with.
- I haven't met Ann.
- Yes, you have.
- [Narrator] Michael had met Ann.
- You let her in.
See, that's her right over there.
- Oh, Ann.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.
I know Ann.
Hey, you!
She's got a little hard-boiled egg going there.
Oh, it's so cute.
She sometimes takes a little pack of mayonnaise... and she'll squirt it in her mouth, and then she'll take an egg... and kind of- mmm.
She calls it a mayonn-egg.
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel so good.
You know, I kind of wanna buy her a diamond.
- Her?
- Ann.
I know I can't afford it, but Aunt Lindsay was telling me about this diamond cream.
George Michael, um, I'm sure that Egg is a very nice person.
I just don't want you spending-
- It's Ann.
Her na- - all your money getting her all glittered up for Easter.
You know?
More importantly, I want us to do this together.
Kinda like a father-son sort of thing, you know?
And since Pop-Pop is no longer president, we get to do it.
- I thought Gob was president.
- Yeah, and I don't have any problem with that.
[Narrator] In fact, since Michael's father escaped from prison... his brother Gob had been made president, albeit in name only.
Which is why Michael was surprised when he got to work the next day.
- You're still in my office.
- Gosh, Michael, I am kind of the president.
And I have no problem with that.
But it is just a title, remember?
Just doing this to appease the stockholders, while they scrutinize me for Dad's crimes.
Hey, Dad may have illegally built some homes in Iraq, which is kinda not cool.
I know, but that's why I've got a business model... that I think is going to restore the image of our company.
We're going to build a second model home.
That's great.
Can I announce it to the board?
Gee, it is my business model.
If you had a business model, then by all means, go in there and do your little dance.
Tell you what we're gonna do.
Rock, paper, scissors for it.
- No, no, I'm not interested in doing-
- One, two, three.
- Paper covers rock.
- It is a rock though.
It should beat everything.
There's not a lot of logic to it.
It's like on a boat with "Women and children first."
Why should they-which, before I forget, I'm buying a company boat.
Sorry?
[Narrator] That morning, Gob had gone to a boat show, where he saw something he wanted.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- What a beauty.
- Thank you.
- I meant you.
- Well.
[Narrator] Gob flirted with her for a while, and finally asked for her number.
- Let's get some digits.
- I'm sorry.
I don't give it out without a firm offer.
Oh, I'll make you a firm offer.
[Narrator] Unfortunately, she wasn't flirting.
And here again, please.
- The Seaward.
- You're not getting a boat.
- One, two, three.
- No, not gonna do it.
- Paper covers rock.
- Fine.
But rock sinks boat.
- Michael?
- Mom, I'm right in the middle of something.
- Get rid of the Seaward.
- I'll leave when I'm good and ready.
It's about your Uncle Oscar.
I want him to move in with you.
You're not kicking him out already, are you?
[Narrator] Michael's uncle had recently moved into Lucille's apartment... where they quickly rekindled a long-dormant romance.
- It was a secret she hoped to keep-
- Oscar, we'll be heard.
- and he didn't.
- That's what makes it so hot.
[Buster] Mother?
Mother!
- I heard zoo noises.
- It's nothing.
Go back to bed.
So, everybody's still up, huh?
[Whimpering]
It's not fair to Buster.
He's a nervous wreck right now.
He's going into the army, for God's sake.
You volunteered him.
I knew you were going to throw that in my face.
Don't worry about it, okay?
They're never gonna take him anyway.
[Narrator] At that moment, Buster was taking his physical at the recruitment center.
I don't have a hole in my heart.
I've never opened my eyes underwater.
My- [Whispers] Reproductive organ... is shaped like- [Whispers] a lobster tail... but without its shell, hmm?
Oh, I guess I have the panic attacks under control.
Oh, and I'm legally blind at night.
[Narrator] But Buster had miscalculated the army's current need for personnel.
Okay, then, let's get you fitted for a uniform.
What?
What?
Hey, why don't you volunteer Oscar?
That would solve both of your problems.
He'd never cut his hair.
[Inhales] That hair.
Listen, Oscar's your problem.
I'm taking care of everything else in this family... including starting construction on a second model home.
We're having a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
We can't have a ribbon-cutting without your father, and he's God knows where.
[Narrator] George Sr. Was in Mexico... with his escape accomplice and ex-secretary, Kitty.
I keep eating so many eggs.
It must be my unconscious desire to have a baby.
Oh, my God.
Can you even imagine how cute the combination of the two of us would be?
I mean, we're all out of "prophylacticos" anyway.
Somebody used the last two on his feet to walk across the bathroom floor.
[Narrator] But he was growing tired of their confined intimacy.
- I've made a huge mistake.
- Hey, it's me.
- Dad?
- Yeah.
Listen, I gotta make this quick.
You're the only one who can save the family, but you gotta keep the company strong... because I'm gonna need some of that money later.
I will, Dad.
It's funny, after all these years of...
- you making fun of me for the magic shows and-
- Gob!
Oh, for God's
- I called to talk to Michael, you horse's [Mexican] - [Female Operator Speaking Spanish]
- [Narrator] Gob was hurt.
- Bye, Pop.
Hey, whoa, whoa, was that Dad?
Yeah, I had to, uh, jump off.
You just had Dad on the phone?
Where was he?
No way to tell, really.
Portugal.
- Down South America way.
- Well, did he wanna talk to me?
No, he wanted to talk to the president.
- I have no problem with that.
- [Narrator] Michael was also hurt.
And George Sr. Was brutally hurt... when he was mistaken for his twin brother Oscar.
- [In Spanish]
- Marijuana?
No, no.
That's my brother.
"Brothero.
Brothero."
[Narrator] That night, Lindsay headed to the club... to try again to meet someone.
Soon, having struck out again, she spotted a man who looked interesting.
He had the lean look, effortless hair... and dressed-down manner of a movie star.
- Buy me a drink?
- I think the bar's closing.
I know a place.
[Narrator] It was at that point that Lindsay had a startling revelation.
[Man] Uh, uh, uh, you get out.
Get out.
Get out.
Out, out, out!
- No homeless in here!
- Homeless?
You're homeless?
You're gross.
Oh, God.
[SlowJazz]
They're taking me in the army.
They didn't think there was enough wrong with me.
- [Stops]
- Well, did they check everything?
Yes.
They even touched my Charlie Browns.
You lied to me.
- You said I wasn't fit to serve.
- Okay, hold on.
Let's calm down, people.
Um, I think I know a little bit about avoiding combat duty.
Now which pinkie do you use less?
Are you nuts?
Do you know what I went through to have this boy?
Oh, I know where the boy came from.
Wait.
Why were you in the pantry?
And Lucille realized it was time to end... whatever it was she had with Oscar.
So, I believe it's a good plan.
The next day, Michael was ready to wow the board with his new business model.
As I told my brother, the president... if we start construction on a second model home... we can be cutting this ribbon within two months.
I said, "That's why you're no longer president."
Two weeks.
Let's do it in two weeks.
Hey!
[Stagy]
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Can we stop the music?
- [Stops]
- I'm not as optimistic that we can get that done.
Gob, I think we both agree that we would do things your way... if you had a business model.
Do you have a business model, Gob?
I am so happy that you asked me that, Michael... because I just happen to have a business model right here.
[Resumes] Solid as a rock
Meet Starla, the new Bluth Company business model... for our phase two campaign.
Bluth Homes:
Solid as a rock.
We'll see you at the ribbon-cutting in two weeks... if my brother doesn't screw it up first.
- Hey!
[Narrator] Gob had committed Michael to building a model home in two weeks.
We can't build a house in two weeks.
Also, I'm not sure how "Solid as a Rock"... helps people forget the fact that we built houses in Iraq.
- I love that.
- But you probably know best because you're president.
We don't have to build a real house, Michael.
Like you said, it's all for appearances anyway.
We throw up a couple of walls.
- We build a fake one.
- What are you talking about?
Nothing on the inside.
I'll never get a crew to build it.
They'd lose their licenses.
Then you build it yourself, damn it!
Hey, there she is, my little business model.
Sorry about that "build it yourself' crap.
I might take her to the ribbon-cutting.
- You end up finding a date yet?
- No.
[Narrator] As Michael grew frustrated by his relationship with Gob...
Lucille tried to end hers with Oscar.
- I want you out of the house.
- Oh, I want you everywhere.
Oscar, no.
I can't have this in my life anymore.
I'm a married woman.
Lucille, you wanna leave?
I won't chase after you.
But before you do, ask yourself, "Where's your husband?"
Because I am here.
I am real.
I am flesh and blood.
And hair.
Oh, God, that hair.
[Sighs]
What will people say?
They'll say, "Those people are in love."
[Hat Crunches]
[Narrator] That night, the evening news report said something very different.
[Man] Lucille Bluth, caught on tape breathing life into a homeless man.
The surprising home video at 10:00.
[Narrator] And Michael prepared to build a house.
Two weeks?
But what if my date's not available?
I'm trying to get a last-minute crew together.
Your inability to get a man interested...
- is not at the top of my list.
- Oh, I've got a man interested, Michael.
- What's wrong with him?
- There's nothing wrong with him.
He is homeless.
Well, I didn't know he was homeless at the time.
- It was humiliating.
- Is this about Gangy's homeless guy?
- Gangy's homeless guy?
- Yeah, it's all over the news.
Gangy gave C.P.R. To a homeless guy on the beach.
[Narrator] Lindsay felt respect for her mother... and decided that perhaps she could overcome her pride and help someone too.
I've got someone for your crew, Michael.
My boyfriend, the homeless guy.
- I wonder if he even has an apartment or- - [Phone Ringing]
- Hello.
- [Lucille On Phone] Did you see the news?
Your Uncle Oscar forced himself on me at the beach today...
- and I didn't have my horn.
- Of course.
It was Uncle Oscar.
Mom, you're not having an affair with him, are you?
You're building a house?
I want you to give it to him.
- It's not a real house.
- Perfect.
He's not a real man.
[Narrator] And George Sr. Made his case to the Mexican police.
My God, I was beaten up here.
I'm telling you.
I'm George.
I'm not Oscar.
I'm George.
- The Cornballer.
- Ssí.
The Cornballer.
[Narrator] George Sr. Had marketed a device called the Cornballer in Mexico... after the severe burns it caused led to it being banned in the U.S.
- Why, did you have one?
- Ssí.
[Narrator] Lindsay, meanwhile, was having trouble finding her homeless man.
- He looked like a movie star.
- The man looked like a movie star because he was a movie star.
His name was Tom Jane, and he was making two movies for a major studio.
One was a gritty personal project about a junkie's life... which he got to do in exchange for making... a rigidly, formulaic popcorn movie.
- He was living on the streets, researching his role.
- Hey, homeless guy.
- Hey.
- I'm not proud of the way...
I was so grossed out when I found out you were gross before.
You really thought I was gross, huh?
Well, at first, I thought you were kind of hot, but I hadn't looked closely enough.
Listen, I have a construction job for you.
And if you clean yourself up, who knows?
You might actually get a date out of this.
- Okay.
- See ya.
Okay, we've all made some sacrifices to be here, but we all want the same thing.
- I wanna live here.
- I wanna buy Ann some diamond dust.
I'm just hoping to get mildly injured, so I can get out of the army.
Bottom line is we've got two weeks to build a house.
It doesn't have to be good.
It just has to look good.
I just want my kids back.
[Narrator] And so, the guys went to work.
- [Grunting] - [Chattering]
[Narrator] Things didn't go smoothly at first.
Buster looked for ways to hurt himself.
But soon the project came together- when Gob stopped by.
Now we're building a house.
- Yeah, I'm pretty proud-
- So, what do you think?
Did I do this or what?
Seems like your brother did it.
My brother does what I tell him to do.
I'm the president.
Where's your "P"?
What?
Oh, no, not again.
- I got it.
- [Groans]
Hey, sorry for the "my brother does what I tell him to do" crap... but I want this to be perfect for when I cut the ribbon tomorrow.
You're cutting the ribbon?
I kinda thought that since I built it...
- I might go ahead and give it a-
- Yeah, okay.
Can you imagine how that would look to the board?
The construction worker cutting the ribbon.
No, no, that's a job for the president.
[Narrator] Michael had a problem with that.
- Gob had taken away something Michael always wanted.
- You got the "P."
Now it was Michael's turn to take something from Gob
- Starla.
And later, Michael set about his plan.
Gob, do you have Starla's phone number?
I got a few business things I'd like to go over with the business model.
Guess who was just over her?
Don't, I'll tell you- me.
- Hmm?
- L- [Bleeps] the business model.
[Narrator] Actually, theyjust made out.
Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms.
Imagine that.
I finally nailed somebody that you weren't after.
That's it.
I've worked too hard and too long for you to keep getting all the credit.
I built that company, that house, and I'm gonna be cutting the ribbon... whether we're all pretending that you're president or not.
Yeah, sure.
I just wanted-
- You just wanted what?
- I just wanted you to be impressed with me.
Dad never was.
Never said a nice thing about me.
He called you the other day.
He didn't even wanna talk to me.
Of course he did!
He never wants to talk to me.
He never has.
- Cut the ribbon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
How about that?
- Michael.
I have no problem with it.
- All right?
Take it easy.
Come on.
- Thank you.
[Narrator] The next day, the Bluth family prepared to unveil phase two.
- [Rock]
- Have you seen your Uncle Gob around?
No.
And I can't find that diamond dust that Aunt Lindsay bought for me.
Oh, well, your Aunt Lindsay has probably taken it.
She's just a taker.
This is your chance, huh?
With the big ribbon-cutters after all these years?
Well, actually, I figured, give Gob a chance, you know?
The guy doesn't get a whole lot of attention in this family.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the Bluth Company, Gob Bluth.
My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done.
But I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done"... for an answer.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you phase two of the Bluth Company.
- A house truly solid as a rock.
- [Music]
- [House Creaking] - [Narrator] But as it turns out...
Michael was right to not be optimistic it could be done.
[Women Screaming]
[Narrator] And Buster saw the chance to get injured enough... to keep him out of the army.
- [Whimpers, Screams]
- But instead...
- got a glimpse inside.
- [Buster] I can't look at that.
[Narrator] Unfortunately, Tobias had to.
I got the wrong homeless man.
I am sorry.
I was looking for Lindsay.
You lied to me.
You both lied to me.
I'm goin'to war.
- Buster, you can't!
- Yes, I can.
I don't agree with your dirty doings here... but I will defend with my life your right to do it.
You planned this all along, didn't you, Michael?
- No, I didn't.
I had no crew.
I had no time.
- You set me up.
[Narrator] Gob charged at Michael with the scissors... but Michael, as he always did, picked rock-
- You wanted to make me look foolish!
- Put down the scissors.
- Put 'em down.
- Foolish with scissors!
[Narrator] Which beat scissors.
Unfortunately, the whole incident was covered by the paper.
Nobody looks good in this.
- Especially that little dude.
- That's Ann.
- Who's-
- It doesn't matter.
Listen.
You know I didn't set you up, okay?
I think the only reason you and I always fight... is that since we were little kids, Dad's always played us off each other.
Dad always said that was your fault.
Anyway, what we oughta do is make a decision right now... not to let Dad get in the middle of our relationship anymore.
- He's not even in town, and we're fighting.
- We're grown men.
- Yeah, let's just move on.
- Look at me.
I'm the president of a company now.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Oh, that's Dad's line.
I bet he saw the paper.
Listen, if you want my respect, you won't answer that, okay?
It's just gonna cause more problems.
[Rings, Disconnects]
Hello?
They hung up.
They hung up on me.
Hiya, guys.
I couldn't get the money.
I don't know what happened.
- I'm impressed you hung up.
- Did I hang up?
- I meant to hit speaker.
- Oh.
- You gotta hit the line first.
- I'm hitting both at the same time.
- These are the lines.
There's a line here.
- But she said-
- It's line and then-
- Hey.
I don't wanna wait until Dad's dead for us to get along.
[Narrator] But it was too late... as George Sr. Would be declared dead... within the hour.
- From now on, we support each other.
- We start with a clean slate.
- Yeah.
- We almost did it though, didn't we?
We almost pulled it off.
- No, it wasn't even close.
- Yeah, a lot of people got hurt.
- This was very, very bad.
- Not great.
Not great.
[Narrator] On the next Arrested Development.
Lindsay finds out the true identity ofher homeless man.
Look.
You're a really nice chick, but I'm not homeless.
I'm Tom Jane.
And even though Lindsay doesn't know who that is... hearing that he isn't homeless is good enough for her.
- Buy me a drink?
- You're really sweet, but, no.
I'm Tom Jane.
[Narrator] And Lindsay, crushed and alone... for the first time misses her husband.
- Tobias.
- [Man Singing]
Lindsay, I'm-
Is that George Michael's diamond cream?
Oh, yes, well, I ran out of blue, and I couldn't find anything else.
I think my nipples are bleeding though.
I don't know if you're supposed to use quite this much.
[Continues]
- That guy's a jerk.
- No, I am.
No, no, I am.
Because I think I need to go to the hospital right away... and see if I can't get some of this diamond dust vacuumed from out of my lungs.
This way.
It is all right.
Kibakichi.
Why did you come here?
A long time ago... humans and monsters named Yokai... and nature lived in perfect harmony... without interfering in each others' lives.
But as time went by... humans forgot their fears.
In the fourth year of Hoi 1707... the new government assembled a team to exterminate the Yokai.
The weakened Yokai escaped deep into the mountains... to avoid contact with the human world.
Some Yokai turned themselves into men, women or the elderly... to hide within the human world.
No one returns home from this town.
Ever.
Ever.
Why did you come here?
Did Onizo send you?
Onizo.
Sake.
Yes, sir.
Please, go ahead.
Is that all you are going to have?
You sure are cheap!
I am going to buy you one.
Sake tastes better when we drink it together.
Oome have a drink with us.
Drink with us, all right?
Where did you come from?
There are so many beautiful women in this town.
May I take you to them?
Brother, are you a gambler?
Please, do not get upset.
Do you want me to take you to the casino?
If you need money I will take what is on your waist in exchange.
Listen to my brother, and don't be so shy.
Anyway, if you carry that with you, you won't get in the casino.
You just bring back some money when you come out of there.
If you do that, I will give you back your sword.
Or perhaps you don't have any... confidence?
Kikio.
You were abandoned by humans.
And you have nowhere else to go.
Put it on the table.
The dice goes in the cup.
- It is set.
- Please bet now.
Two and six, even.
I won again!
Everyone, we are now going to change our dealer.
Thank you.
And now, our proud Akane will shake our dice.
For those who haven't had any luck, perhaps your luck will change now.
So, please, do your best.
Brother!
Keys.
I will shake this cup to the best of my ability.
So please be kind to me.
Oup!
Are you ready?
You are ready.
I will shake the cup.
Oup is down.
Please bet now.
Bet now.
If it's odd, I'm done.
Open it, show!
Three and six, odd.
You are beautiful.
Kikio really is a good girl.
She is really beautiful.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Pass!
What is the matter?
There is a man who is quite interesting.
How interesting?
He is not very good at the small game.
But when it comes to betting big... he never loses.
He is not cheating, so he really is a true gambler.
Are you ready?
You are ready.
One and six odd, I will shake again.
Boss!
Yamayi-sama is waiting for you.
I am sorry.
But we ask that you wait a bit longer for us to fulfill our promise.
Again?
You promised me that this time was for sure.
Didn't you?
We found the ideal place.
But there are some people in the clan who dislike me.
If I take any action now, they'll become suspicious... and our plan will be destroyed.
I, Onizo... put my life at risk for your promise, Yamayi-san.
Even though our power has weakened... if all of the family puts their lives at risk...
Onizo-san, please do not try to threaten me.
I will fulfill my promise very soon.
Please agree with Yamayi-san.
If we succeed... the day you and your people can live peacefully will come.
Yamayi-sama's plan of reform is so perfect... that even ordinary Yokai will not understand it.
But we must do it.
The custom of discriminating against one's appearance... must change as soon as possible.
Kikio!
Excuse yourself.
The important thing is... to respect and understand each other's needs.
Like ourselves, who are different creatures and cultures... but can become friends.
That is right.
Onizo-san, who lives with Kikio, will understand this, won't you?
Kikio has no place to go.
That is all.
Son of a bitch!
How am I supposed to gamble with a woman dealer?
!
Let me gamble with a male dealer!
I understand you.
Let's go to another room.
Go, you idiot!
Excuse me.
I have something to tell you.
Please.
It is so tiring entertaining Onizo, isn't it?
Yes.
But we do not have a choice right now.
We need their help, for now.
Since Onizo helped us with that dirty job... we've gotten rid of a lot of so-called trash.
Well...
I think Kikio knows too much about what is going on.
When the time comes we can get rid of her.
I don't think Onizo is going to let her go.
I am sorry to bother you.
If you want to say something, do it quickly.
Don't be... in such a rush.
I've been watching you gamble.
You are quite... skillful.
I like that.
What is your... name?
Kibakichi.
From Inugame village.
Kibakichi-san... of Inugame village.
My family takes care of this town.
I am Boss Onizo... of the Onizo family.
You can ask Achichi... about the murder details.
This way, please.
Brother... is it true that in Akami swamp you killed Kapa?
We do not know what to do with those Kapa.
Because of them... people have stopped coming to this town.
We have got a job to do here.
And we do not want anyone bothering us... including Kapa.
Brother!
Will you help us?
Please!
What kind of help are you talking about?
I will tell you about that later.
You should stay here for a while... and watch us with your own eyes and then decide.
If you do not like what you see, you can leave without any trouble.
We have been looking for a good gambler... and our boss trusts a man who has good luck.
A gambler must return his obligation.
Even if he is in town for only one night.
Thanks for saying that.
We appreciate it.
She is Boss Onizo's woman.
How about me?
Old woman, just think about your age.
What are you saying?
Don't you know that women are at their best at my age?
That is enough.
Go away.
I will introduce a beautiful woman to him.
- No, no!
- Yes!
Yes, I will.
I will do it.
Why are you drinking early in the morning?
Go back to work!
Work, work, get to work!
Work!
Good, good!
One more, one more.
I am lost!
We have not had a customer like you for a long time.
Everyone is very happy to have you.
Are we too much for you?
No, you are not.
I have been alone for a long time.
And I have forgotten how to associate with people.
We are all old friends.
Some were chased away from their homes... and others arrived without reason.
Everyone likes and trusts Boss Onizo.
We are just like a family.
Do you find that funny?
It does not sound like the Yakuza, does it?
Our lord is not feeling well.
So he said to let Yamayi-sama... handle everything related to the festival.
Everyone taking care of our lord must be very concerned about him.
There's no other choice.
We must take care of the clan ourselves.
We are depending on you.
Of course.
You can count on me.
Just let me handle everything.
Thanks for waiting.
Oup!
I will shake the cup.
Please.
Two and six, even.
Five and four, odd.
One and six, odd.
One and two, odd.
Shit I be serious, I want a male dealer!
Four and one, odd.
Two and four, even.
Four and three, odd.
Two and four, even.
Two and four, even.
One and six, odd.
The game is over, Boss Oshiozo.
What do you think you are doing?
How could you bring that into the Onizo family casino?
I hope you know what you are doing.
Let's make a deal.
Oome in.
Please take whomever you like.
Onizo is some guy!
Okay, okay.
- What a handsome man you are!
- Let me have a drink first.
You are cute, aren't you?
How about another?
I'll have many more!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Kibakichi-san.
We Yokai do not like humans.
But we must survive.
We are trying so hard.
Kibakichi-san... why do you still want to help them?
We are Yokai.
What is wrong with that?
What is going on?
I am sure...
Kibakichi-san sees what we are.
And he also has a grudge against the humans.
Let's go.
Very soon our dream will come true.
- Your dream?
- That's right.
I n the near future...
Yamayi Osuke-sama will become head of the Momoi clan.
He will create a place where we can live peacefully.
The humans will not honor their promise to the Yokai.
That is we must all get along.
We should not give them an excuse... because of some feud among ourselves.
That is right.
If will unite and show the humans how strong we are... they will be scared of us.
And they cannot break their promises so easily!
Kibakichi-san.
Please help us.
It is for the Yokai survival.
Kibakichi-san.
You were also chased away from your home and came here!
Isn't that right?
If they chase us away from here... we have nowhere else to go!
I thought... we could share our dream... with you.
Are you not going to interfere?
Because I do not care about... your dream.
Anju.
You are alive, Anju.
Do not call my name so easily.
Betrayer!
Kibakichi, have you forgotten what you have done?
Kibakichi...
Our people were living peacefully...
In a village located deep In the mountains... without any contact from the outside world.
Kibakichi.
It was all your fault because you trusted the humans.
They are selfish monsters who only care about themselves.
They came to our home and killed all of our family.
If only you did not trust them I
If only you did not trust them!
If I don't kill you I cannot apologize to our dead family.
Brother!
What's going on?
Who was that?
Should I let my men handle it?
No, it's all right.
It isn't any of your concern.
Only one life to live.
I might as well give my life to you.
Wonderful!
How powerful they are!
It was made in England... and its quality has been improved.
With this on our side... the reformation of Yamayi-san will be realized.
That's right!
We need a great leader like Yamayi-sama... for this country.
Let's blow up these coward government officials... with that machine gun!
You may be rushing a bit.
Maybe I am.
We must first take leadership of our clan.
The power of having this ability is quite wonderful.
You are right.
And this power...
will never betray us.
We do not need people who at any time might betray us.
That is right.
We must get rid of them as soon as possible.
The Yokai's powers are weakening.
They weren't any help at all, were they?
No.
But we still can use them.
How?
I think they will make a very good target... while we practice with the machine gun.
I see.
We can get rid of a nuisance... and practice shooting... at the same time!
That's just what we would expect from the brightest man in the country.
I respect you with all my heart.
However... we must be cautious.
They are very suspicious and we will never know... when they will betray us.
Deliver this to them.
Yes, sir.
Have a drink, Kibakichi-san.
Achichi-san.
Do you really believe... the Yokai will be given the holy land?
Yes.
Do not believe the humans.
I am sure they will betray you.
I want to trust them one more time.
I do not believe... that all humans are bad people.
What are you praying for?
For everyone's happiness.
I believe there is a place... where we can live in peace.
I am sure it must be somewhere.
It is time, I must ask you.
Yokai?
That is right.
With these, I let customer go home with money, once in a while.
About two out of every ten people.
And the winner brings more... people to the casino?
I played a real game with you, Kibakichi-san.
I did not cheat.
Didn't I say... that I was looking for a man with good luck?
I thought it was strange.
Besides Hachigoro, Akane is a good dealer.
But every once in a while she loses concentration.
That's all right.
The casino's... purpose is not to make money.
You were taking away the lives of the gamblers.
Weren't you?
You've traveled around the country.
So you should know that casinos have not been legalized.
Do you know why?
Even if there was a law... no one would obey it.
So, as to the Yakuza... and those who threaten others...
I will get rid of them!
Don't you think this kind of job is quite suitable for Yokai?
It is foolish.
The humans are just using you.
And we also use the humans to make our dreams come true!
That's good enough.
Do you really think... your dream will come true?
Life... is just like a spot on a dice.
We won't know... until we shake it.
You have come this far... so, go ahead and try... until you get your number on the dice.
Thank you.
Are you all right?
Anju...
Are you happy here?
Humans abandoned me.
And I had no place to go.
No one waited for me.
But Onizo found me.
And he raised me.
Yamayi Osuke.
I appoint you leader of the clan with a 6,000 goku fortune.
Because of Yamayi-sama... the Momoi clan have quickly reduced... the amount of men who commit crimes against us.
Also our lord was very happy... to receive good words from the government.
But... we still have enemies to eliminate.
Once you have accomplished your mission...
I, Wutani... will make sure to report this to our lord.
It's getting chilly out here.
I do not want you to catch a cold.
Oome on, let's go inside.
You've always caught a cold so easily... even since you were very young.
We didn't know what to do... since we never knew how to take care of a human child.
Kikio, you are a good girl.
You have grown up to be such a beautiful, beautiful girl.
Yes.
Taruchen!
Taruchen!
- Let's get out of here!
- Taruchen!
- Hurry!
Hurry!
- Taruchen!
Taruchen!
Achiro!
Sister!
Sister!
Sister...
We are leaving.
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
You, insect...
This way.
Listen.
Don't you come out.
Do you understand?
You'll be okay.
I found them!
They're here!
You...
You...
You...
How could you destroy Boss Onizo's dream?
How could you destroy Boss Onizo's dream?
How beautiful... to be still alive.
You, monster!
Help the women and children inside.
Grandma!
- Don't worry about me.
- Grandma!
Get out of here, Kikio.
If you survive... some day you will find... happiness.
Kikio, are you all right?
Is Kibakichi still alive?
It is not safe out there.
They surrounded us.
Get inside!
Get inside!
Oshino!
Boss, this way!
Kikio!
I am...
I am staying here.
Yamayi.
I was trying to use your power... to win the leadership of my clan.
We do not need... the Yokai's power any longer.
We have another power now.
To tell you the truth, I was afraid of you.
That's why I thought I'd have you on our side.
But now... we have nothing to be afraid of.
Our contract will not exist if we destroy the evidence.
I stand to gain nothing from you now.
So, I must destroy you.
Am I right?
We did everything you told us to do.
That is correct.
And now you have to show your loyalty to me once again.
Onizo... will you please kill Kikio?
Oshino was my daughter.
You told me that you wanted a place... where the Yokai could live peacefully.
It was a good idea.
But if humans live with you in your area... that's not very good.
If humans and Yokai mix together... there will be trouble in the future, just like we have now.
We know how much you adore Kikio.
So if you kill her... you will prove your Loyalty to Yamayi-sama.
If you kill Kikio...
I will let the others go.
It is not too bad a deal.
What is the matter, Onizo?
It is... for our dream.
There is no choice.
This is going to be... quite a show.
Kikio.
It is all right.
As long as I can go to Paradise... it is all right.
What Paradise?
The Yokai go to Hell.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Move!
Yes, the tough one.
Get out of my way!
Get out of the way!
Forgive me.
I have decided to become Yamayi-sama's man.
Take this!
You, monster.
The Yokai's appearance Is very different than yours.
Kiklo...
I will never let anyone ruin your beauty.
Your prayer... has been answered.
I'm sure... that Onizo went to Paradise.
I'm sure of it.
Where are you going?
Wherever you go, the Yokai will be chased by humans.
This Is our fate.
Do not mix with them, just live quietly... until your time comes.
I am going to find a place... where I can live with this child.
You will find it.
There must be somewhere.
A place of our own.
And for you as well, Kibakichi-san.

Kibakichi, why did you come here?
Music by KAWAI Kenji
Directed by HARAGUCHI Tomoo
A long time ago, humans, Yokai (Monsters) and nature lived in perfect harmony without interfering in each other's lives.
But as time went by, humans forgot their fears.
In the 4th Year of Hoei (1707) the Edo Government assembled a team to exterminate the Yokai.
The weakened Yokai escaped deep into the mountains to avoid contact with the human world.
Some Yokai turned themselves into men, women or the elderly to hide within the human world...
No one returns home from this town...
Why did you come here?
Did Onizo send you?
Onizo?
Hey, hey, hey...
It's mine!
Sake.
Yes, sir.
Please go ahead.
Is that all you're going to have?
!
You sure are cheap!
I'm going to buy you one.
Hey, sake tastes better when we drink together...
Come have a drink with us!
Drink with us, alright?
Hey, where did you come from?
There are so many beautiful women in this town.
May I take you to them?
Brother, are you a gambler?
Please don't get upset.
Do you want me to take you to the casino?
If you need money I will take what's on your waist in exchange.
Listen to my brother and don't be so shy.
Anyway, if you carry that with you you won't get in the casino.
You just bring back some money when you come out of there.
If you do that, I'll give you back your sword.
Or perhaps you don't have any confidence?
Kikyo...
You were abandoned by the humans and you have no where else to go.
4 and 3 Odd!
Dice goes in the cup.
It's set!
Please bet now!
2 and 6 Even!
I won again!
Everyone, we are now going to change our dealer!
Thank you.
And now, our proud female dealer will shake the dice!
For those who haven't had any luck perhaps your luck will change now, so please do your best!
Brother, please!
I will shake this cup to the best of my ability...
So please, be kind to me!
Cup!
Are you ready?
You are ready.
I will shake the cup.
Cup is down!
- Please bet now!
- Bet now!
It's odd!
- I am done!
Open it!
3 and 6 Odd!
You are beautiful!
Kikyo really is a good girl...
She is really beautiful!
Beautiful!
Beautiful!
Boss!
What's the matter?
There is a man who is quite interesting...
How interesting?
He isn't very good at the small game but when comes to betting big, he never loses.
He isn't cheating, so he really is a true gambler.
Are you ready?
You are ready... 1 and 6 Odd!
I will shake again.
Boss Yamaji-sama is waiting for you.
I am sorry but we ask that you wait a bit longer for us to fulfill our promise.
Again?
You promised me that this time was for sure, didn't you?
We found the ideal place...
But there are some people in the clan who dislike me.
If I take any action now they'll become suspicious and our plan will be destroyed.
-I, Onizo put my life at risk for your promise, Yamaji-sama.
Even though our power has weakened if all of the family puts their lives at risk...!
Onizo-san, please don't try to threaten me.
I will fulfill my promise very soon.
Please agree with Yamaji-san...
If we succeed the day you and your people can live peacefully will come.
Yamaji-sama's plan of reform is so perfect that even ordinary Yokai won't understand it.
But we must do it...
The custom of discriminating against one's appearance must change as soon as possible.
Kikyo excuse yourself.
The important thing is to respect and understand each other's needs.
Like ourselves, who are different creatures and cultures but can become friends.
- That's right.
Onizo-san, who lives with Kikyo, will understand this, won't you?
Kikyo has no place to go...
That's all...
Son of a bitch!
How am I supposed to gamble with woman dealer?
!
Let me gamble with a male dealer!
- I understand you!
Let's go to another room!
Let's go!
- You idiot!
Excuse me...
I have something to tell you.
Please...
It's so tiring entertaining Onizo, isn't it?
Yes, but we don't have a choice right now.
We need their help, for now.
Since Onizo helped us with that dirty job we've gotten rid of a lot of so-called trash.
Well I think Kikyo knows too much about what's going on.
When the time comes, we can get rid of her.
I don't think that Onizo's going to let her go.
I am sorry to bother you.
If you want to say something, do it quickly.
Don't be in such a rush.
I've been watching you gamble.
You are quite skillful...
I like that...
What is your name?
Kibakichi from Inugami Village...
Kibakichi-san of Inugami Village?
My family takes care of this town.
I am boss Onizo, of the Onizo family.
You can ask Heishichi about the minor details.
This way please...
This way please...
Brother is it true that at Himegami swamp, you killed Kappa?
We don't know what to do with those Kappa.
Because of them, people have stopped coming to this town.
We've got a job to do here and we don't want anyone bothering us, including those Kappa.
Brother, will you please help us?
!
What kind of help are you talking about?
- I'll tell you about that later.
You should stay here for a while and watch us with your own eyes and then decide.
If you don't like what you see, you can leave without any trouble.
We've been looking for a good gambler and our boss trusts a man who has good luck.
A gambler must return his obligation, even if he's in town for only one night.
Thanks for saying that!
We appreciate it...
She is boss Onizo's woman.
How about me?
- Old woman, just think about your age!
What are you saying?
Don't you know that women are at their best at my age?
- That's enough!
Go away!
I'll introduce a beautiful woman to him!
- No!
No!
Yes, I will!
I will do it!
Why are you drinking this early in the morning?
Go back to work!
Good!
Good!
One more!
One more!
I've lost!
We haven't had a customer like you for a long time.
Everyone is very happy to have you.
Are we too much for you?
- No, you are not.
I've been alone for a long time and I've forgotten how to associate with people.
- We are all old friends...
Some were chased away from their homes and others arrived without reason.
Everyone likes and trusts boss Onizo.
We are just like a family.
Do you find that funny?
It doesn't sound like the Yakuza, does it?
Our lord is not feeling well so he said to let Yamaji-sama handle everything related to the festival.
Everyone taking care of our lord must be very concerned about him.
- There's no other choice.
We must take care of the clan ourselves.
We are depending on you.
Of course, you can count on me.
Just let me handle everything.
Thanks for waiting.
Cup!
I will shake the cup.
Please.
2 and 6 Even!
5 and 4 Odd!
1 and 6 Odd!
1 and 2 Odd!
Shit!
Be serious!
I want a male dealer!
4 and 1 Odd!
2 and 4 Even!
4 and 3 Odd!
2 and 4 Even!
2 and 4 Even!
1 and 6 Odd!
The game is over, boss Oshiozo!
What do you think you're doing?
!
- How could you bring that into the Onizo family casino!
I hope you know what you're doing.
Let's make a deal.
Come in.
Please take whomever you like.
That Onizo is some guy!
Okay!
Okay!
What a handsome man you are!
- Well, let me have a drink first.
You are cute, aren't you?
How about another?
I will have many more!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Kibakichi-san!
We Yokai, do not like humans.
But we must survive...
We are trying so hard...
Kibakichi-san, why do you still want to help them?
We are Yokai...
What is wrong with that?
!
What is going on?
!
I am sure Kibakichi-san sees what we are and he also has a grudge against the humans!
Let's go.
Very soon, our dream will come true...
Your dream?
- That's right!
In the near future, Yamaji Yosuke-sama will become head of the Momoi clan.
He will create a place where we can live peacefully!
The humans will not honor their promise to the Yokai!
- That is why we must all get along!
We shouldn't give them an excuse because of some feud amongst ourselves...
- That's right!
If we unite and show the humans how strong we are, they will be scared of us!
Then they cannot break their promise so easily!
- Kibakichi-san, please help us!
It's for the Yokai's survival!
Kibakichi-san you were also chased away from your home and came here!
Isn't that right?
!
If they chase us away from here we have nowhere else to go!
I thought we could share our dream with you.
I'm not going to interfere because I don't care about your dream.
Anju...
You're alive, Anju...
Don't call my name so easily!
Betrayer...!
Kibakichi, have you forgotten what you've done?
Our people were living peacefully, in a village located deep in the mountains.
Without any contact from the outside world.
Kibakichi it was all your fault because you trusted the humans!
They are selfish monsters, who only care about themselves!
They came to our home and killed all of our family...
If only you didn't trust them!
If only you didn't trust them...
If I don't kill you I can't apologize to our dead family!
Hey brother, what's going on?
!
Who was that?
Should I let my men handle it?
No, it's alright.
It isn't any of your concern.
Only one life to live I might as well give my life to you.
Wonderful!
How powerful they are!
It was made in England, and its quality has been improved.
With this on our side, the reformation of Yamaji-san will be realized.
- That's right!
We need a great leader like Yamaji-sama for this country!
Let's blow up those coward government officials with that machine gun!
You may be rushing a bit.
Maybe I am...
We must first take leadership of our clan.
The power of having this ability is quite wonderful.
You're right.
And this power will never betray us.
We don't need people who at any time might betray us.
- That's right.
We must get rid of them as soon as possible.
The Yokai's powers are weakening.
They weren't any help at all, were they?
No, but we still can use them.
- How?
I think they'll make a very good target while we practice with the machine gun.
I see...
We can get rid of the nuisance and practice shooting at same time!
That's just what we would expect from the brightest man in the country!
I respect you with all of my heart.
However, we must be cautious.
- They are very suspicious, and we'll never know when they'll betray us.
Deliver this to them.
- Yes, sir!
Have a drink, Kibakichi-san!
Heishichi-san...
Do you really believe that the Yokai will be given their own land?
Yes.
Don't believe the humans.
I'm sure they'll betray you.
I want to trust them one more time...
I don't believe that all humans are bad people.
What are you praying for?
For everyone's happiness.
I believe there is a place where we can live in peace.
I'm sure it must be somewhere...
It's time I must ask you to work.
Yokai...
That's right.
With this, I let my customers go home with money once in a while.
About two out of every ten people...
- And the winner brings more people to the casino.
I played a real game with you, Kibakichi-san.
I did not cheat.
Didn't I say that I was looking for a man with good luck?
I thought it was strange.
Besides Hachigoro, Akane is a good dealer.
But every once in a while she loses concentration.
- That's alright!
The casino's purpose is not to make money.
You were taking away the lives of the gamblers, weren't you?
You've travelled around the country so you should knowthat casinos have not been legalized.
Do you know why?
Even if there was a law, no one would obey it!
So, as to the Yakuza and those who threaten others I will get rid of them!
Don't you think this kind of job is quite suitable for Yokai?
!
It's foolish...
The humans are just using you.
- And we also use the humans to make our dreams come true!
That's good enough...
Do you really think your dream will come true?
Life is just like a spot on the dice.
We won't know until we shake it.
You've come this far so go ahead and try until you get your number on the dice.
Thank you!
Are you alright?
Are you happy here?
Humans abandoned me and I had no place to go.
No one waited for me.
But Onizo found me and he raised me.
Yamaji Yosuke, I appoint you leader of the clan with a 6,000 goku fortune.
Because of Yamaji-sama the Momoi clan have quickly reduced the amount of men who commit crimes against us.
Also, our lord was very happy to receive good wards from the government.
But we still have enemies to eliminate.
Once you've accomplished your mission I, Ootani, will make sure to report this to our lord.
It's getting chilly out here!
I don't want you to catch a cold!
Come on, let's go inside!
You've always caught a cold so easily, even since you were very young.
We didn't know what to do since we never knew how to take care of a human child!
Kikyo, you are a good girl.
You've grown up to be such a beautiful girl...
Dorochan!
Dorochan!
- Let's get out of here!
Hurry!
Kojiro!
Sister!
Sister!
Sister...
We are leaving!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
You insect...
This way!
Listen!
Don't you come out!
Do you understand?
You'll be okay...
I've found them!
They're here!
You...
You...
You...
How could you destroy boss Onizo's dream?
!
How pitiful to be still alive...
You monsters!
Help the women and children escape out of the back!
Grandma!
Don't worry about me!
Get out of here!
Kikyo, if you survive someday you will find happiness.
Kikyo, are you alright?
Is Kibakichi still alive?
- It's not safe out there!
They've surrounded us!
Get inside!
Get inside!
Oshino!
Boss, this way!
Kikyo!
I am...
I am staying here!
Yamaji!
I was trying to use your power to win the leadership of my clan.
We don't need the Yokai's power any longer.
We have another kind of power now...
To tell you the truth, I was afraid of you.
That's why I'd thought I'd have you on our side.
- But now, we have nothing to be afraid of...
Our contract will not exist if we destroy the evidence.
I stand to gain nothing from you now so I must destroy you.
Am I right...?
We did everything you told us to do!
That is correct...
And now you'll have to show your loyalty to me once again.
Onizo, will you please kill Kikyo?
!
Shino was my daughter...
You told me that you wanted a place where the Yokai could live peacefully.
It was good idea but if humans live with you in your area, that's not very good.
If humans and Yokai mix together there will be trouble in the future.
Just like we have now...
We know how much you adore Kikyo, so if you kill her you will prove your loyalty to Yamaji-sama!
If you kill Kikyo, I will let the others go.
It's not too bad a deal...
What's the matter, Onizo?
It's for our dream!
There's no choice!
This is going to be quite a show...
Kikyo...
It's alright...
As long as I can go to paradise...
It's alright...
What paradise...?
The Yokai go to hell...
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Move!
He is a tough one!
- Get out of my way!
- Move!
Forgive me...
I've decided to become Yamaji-sama's man...
Take this!
You monster...
The Yokai's appearance is very different than humans...
Kikyo...
I will never let anyone ruin your beauty...
Your prayer has been answered.
I am sure that Onizo went to paradise.
I'm sure of it...
Where are you going?
Wherever you go, the Yokai will be chased by humans.
That is our fate...
Do not mix with them...
Just live quietly until your time comes...
I'm going to find a place where I can live with this child.
You will find it...
There must be somewhere...
A place of our own and for you as well, Kibakichi-san.

Onizo?
Hey, hey, hey...
It's mine!
Sake.
Yes, sir.
Please go ahead.
Is that all you're going to have?
!
You sure are cheap!
I'm going to buy you one.
Hey, sake tastes better when we drink together...
Come have a drink with us!
Drink with us, alright?
Hey, where did you come from?
There are so many beautiful women in this town.
May I take you to them?
Brother, are you a gambler?
Please don't get upset.
Do you want me to take you to the casino?
If you need money I will take what's on your waist in exchange.
Listen to my brother and don't be so shy.
Anyway, if you carry that with you you won't get in the casino.
You just bring back some money when you come out of there.
If you do that, I'll give you back your sword.
Or perhaps you don't have any confidence?
Kikyo...
You were abandoned by the humans and you have no where else to go.
4 and 3 Odd!
Dice goes in the cup.
It's set!
Please bet now!
2 and 6 Even!
I won again!
Everyone, we are now going to change our dealer!
Thank you.
And now, our proud female dealer will shake the dice!
For those who haven't had any luck perhaps your luck will change now, so please do your best!
Brother, please!
I will shake this cup to the best of my ability...
So please, be kind to me!
Cup!
Are you ready?
You are ready.
I will shake the cup.
Cup is down!
- Please bet now!
- Bet now!
It's odd!
- I am done!
Open it!
3 and 6 Odd!
You are beautiful!
Kikyo really is a good girl...
She is really beautiful!
Beautiful!
Beautiful!
Boss!
What's the matter?
There is a man who is quite interesting...
How interesting?
He isn't very good at the small game but when comes to betting big, he never loses.
He isn't cheating, so he really is a true gambler.
Are you ready?
You are ready... 1 and 6 Odd!
I will shake again.
Boss Yamaji-sama is waiting for you.
I am sorry but we ask that you wait a bit longer for us to fulfill our promise.
Again?
You promised me that this time was for sure, didn't you?
We found the ideal place...
But there are some people in the clan who dislike me.
If I take any action now they'll become suspicious and our plan will be destroyed.
-I, Onizo put my life at risk for your promise, Yamaji-sama.
Even though our power has weakened if all of the family puts their lives at risk...!
Onizo-san, please don't try to threaten me.
I will fulfill my promise very soon.
Please agree with Yamaji-san...
If we succeed the day you and your people can live peacefully will come.
Yamaji-sama's plan of reform is so perfect that even ordinary Yokai won't understand it.

How am I supposed to gamble with woman dealer?
!
Let me gamble with a male dealer!
- I understand you!
Let's go to another room!
Let's go!
- You idiot!
Excuse me...
I have something to tell you.
Please...
It's so tiring entertaining Onizo, isn't it?
Yes, but we don't have a choice right now.
We need their help, for now.
Since Onizo helped us with that dirty job we've gotten rid of a lot of so-called trash.
Well I think Kikyo knows too much about what's going on.
When the time comes, we can get rid of her.
I don't think that Onizo's going to let her go.
I am sorry to bother you.
If you want to say something, do it quickly.
Don't be in such a rush.
I've been watching you gamble.
You are quite skillful...
I like that...
What is your name?
Kibakichi from Inugami Village...
Kibakichi-san of Inugami Village?
My family takes care of this town.
I am boss Onizo, of the Onizo family.
You can ask Heishichi about the minor details.
This way please...
This way please...
Brother is it true that at Himegami swamp, you killed Kappa?
We don't know what to do with those Kappa.
Because of them, people have stopped coming to this town.
We've got a job to do here and we don't want anyone bothering us, including those Kappa.
Brother, will you please help us?
!
What kind of help are you talking about?
- I'll tell you about that later.
You should stay here for a while and watch us with your own eyes and then decide.
If you don't like what you see, you can leave without any trouble.
We've been looking for a good gambler and our boss trusts a man who has good luck.
A gambler must return his obligation, even if he's in town for only one night.
Thanks for saying that!
We appreciate it...
She is boss Onizo's woman.
How about me?
- Old woman, just think about your age!
What are you saying?
Don't you know that women are at their best at my age?
- That's enough!
Go away!
I'll introduce a beautiful woman to him!
- No!
No!
Yes, I will!
I will do it!
Why are you drinking this early in the morning?
Go back to work!
Good!
Good!
One more!
One more!
I've lost!
We haven't had a customer like you for a long time.
Everyone is very happy to have you.
Are we too much for you?
- No, you are not.
I've been alone for a long time and I've forgotten how to associate with people.
- We are all old friends...
Some were chased away from their homes and others arrived without reason.
Everyone likes and trusts boss Onizo.
We are just like a family.
Do you find that funny?
It doesn't sound like the Yakuza, does it?
Our lord is not feeling well so he said to let Yamaji-sama handle everything related to the festival.
Everyone taking care of our lord must be very concerned about him.
- There's no other choice.
We must take care of the clan ourselves.
We are depending on you.
Of course, you can count on me.
Just let me handle everything.
Thanks for waiting.
Cup!
I will shake the cup.
Please.
2 and 6 Even!
5 and 4 Odd!
1 and 6 Odd!
1 and 2 Odd!
Shit!
Be serious!
I want a male dealer!
4 and 1 Odd!
2 and 4 Even!
4 and 3 Odd!
2 and 4 Even!
2 and 4 Even!
1 and 6 Odd!
The game is over, boss Oshiozo!
What do you think you're doing?
!
- How could you bring that into the Onizo family casino!
I hope you know what you're doing.
Let's make a deal.
Come in.
Please take whomever you like.
That Onizo is some guy!
Okay!
Okay!
What a handsome man you are!
- Well, let me have a drink first.
You are cute, aren't you?
How about another?
I will have many more!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Kibakichi-san!
We Yokai, do not like humans.
But we must survive...
We are trying so hard...
Kibakichi-san, why do you still want to help them?
We are Yokai...
What is wrong with that?
!
What is going on?
!
I am sure Kibakichi-san sees what we are and he also has a grudge against the humans!
Let's go.
Very soon, our dream will come true...
Your dream?
- That's right!
In the near future, Yamaji Yosuke-sama will become head of the Momoi clan.
He will create a place where we can live peacefully!
The humans will not honor their promise to the Yokai!
- That is why we must all get along!
We shouldn't give them an excuse because of some feud amongst ourselves...
- That's right!
If we unite and show the humans how strong we are, they will be scared of us!
Then they cannot break their promise so easily!
- Kibakichi-san, please help us!
It's for the Yokai's survival!
Kibakichi-san you were also chased away from your home and came here!
Isn't that right?
!
If they chase us away from here we have nowhere else to go!
I thought we could share our dream with you.
I'm not going to interfere because I don't care about your dream.
Anju...
You're alive, Anju...
Don't call my name so easily!
Betrayer...!
Kibakichi, have you forgotten what you've done?
Our people were living peacefully, in a village located deep in the mountains.
Without any contact from the outside world.
Kibakichi it was all your fault because you trusted the humans!
They are selfish monsters, who only care about themselves!
They came to our home and killed all of our family...
If only you didn't trust them!
If only you didn't trust them...
If I don't kill you I can't apologize to our dead family!
Hey brother, what's going on?
!
Who was that?
Should I let my men handle it?
No, it's alright.
It isn't any of your concern.
Only one life to live I might as well give my life to you.
Wonderful!
How powerful they are!
It was made in England, and its quality has been improved.
With this on our side, the reformation of Yamaji-san will be realized.
- That's right!
We need a great leader like Yamaji-sama for this country!
Let's blow up those coward government officials with that machine gun!
You may be rushing a bit.
Maybe I am...
We must first take leadership of our clan.
The power of having this ability is quite wonderful.
You're right.
And this power will never betray us.
We don't need people who at any time might betray us.
- That's right.
We must get rid of them as soon as possible.
The Yokai's powers are weakening.
They weren't any help at all, were they?
No, but we still can use them.
- How?
I think they'll make a very good target while we practice with the machine gun.
I see...
We can get rid of the nuisance and practice shooting at same time!
That's just what we would expect from the brightest man in the country!
I respect you with all of my heart.
However, we must be cautious.
- They are very suspicious, and we'll never know when they'll betray us.
Deliver this to them.
- Yes, sir!
Have a drink, Kibakichi-san!
Heishichi-san...
Do you really believe that the Yokai will be given their own land?
Yes.
Don't believe the humans.
I'm sure they'll betray you.
I want to trust them one more time...
I don't believe that all humans are bad people.
What are you praying for?
For everyone's happiness.
I believe there is a place where we can live in peace.
I'm sure it must be somewhere...
It's time I must ask you to work.
Yokai...
That's right.
With this, I let my customers go home with money once in a while.
About two out of every ten people...
- And the winner brings more people to the casino.
I played a real game with you, Kibakichi-san.
I did not cheat.
Didn't I say that I was looking for a man with good luck?
I thought it was strange.
Besides Hachigoro, Akane is a good dealer.
But every once in a while she loses concentration.
- That's alright!
The casino's purpose is not to make money.
You were taking away the lives of the gamblers, weren't you?
You've travelled around the country so you should knowthat casinos have not been legalized.
Do you know why?
Even if there was a law, no one would obey it!
So, as to the Yakuza and those who threaten others I will get rid of them!
Don't you think this kind of job is quite suitable for Yokai?
!
It's foolish...
The humans are just using you.
- And we also use the humans to make our dreams come true!
That's good enough...
Do you really think your dream will come true?
Life is just like a spot on the dice.
We won't know until we shake it.
You've come this far so go ahead and try until you get your number on the dice.
Thank you!
Are you alright?
Are you happy here?
Humans abandoned me and I had no place to go.
No one waited for me.
But Onizo found me and he raised me.
Yamaji Yosuke, I appoint you leader of the clan with a 6,000 goku fortune.
Because of Yamaji-sama the Momoi clan have quickly reduced the amount of men who commit crimes against us.
Also, our lord was very happy to receive good wards from the government.
But we still have enemies to eliminate.
Once you've accomplished your mission I, Ootani, will make sure to report this to our lord.
It's getting chilly out here!
I don't want you to catch a cold!
Come on, let's go inside!
You've always caught a cold so easily, even since you were very young.
We didn't know what to do since we never knew how to take care of a human child!
Kikyo, you are a good girl.
You've grown up to be such a beautiful girl...
Dorochan!
Dorochan!
- Let's get out of here!
Hurry!
Kojiro!
Sister!
Sister!
Sister...
We are leaving!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
You insect...
This way!
Listen!
Don't you come out!
Do you understand?
You'll be okay...
I've found them!
They're here!
You...
You...
You...
How could you destroy boss Onizo's dream?
!
How pitiful to be still alive...
You monsters!
Help the women and children escape out of the back!
Grandma!
Don't worry about me!
Get out of here!
Kikyo, if you survive someday you will find happiness.
Kikyo, are you alright?
Is Kibakichi still alive?
- It's not safe out there!
They've surrounded us!
Get inside!
Get inside!
Oshino!
Boss, this way!
Kikyo!
I am...
I am staying here!
Yamaji!
I was trying to use your power to win the leadership of my clan.
We don't need the Yokai's power any longer.
We have another kind of power now...
To tell you the truth, I was afraid of you.
That's why I'd thought I'd have you on our side.
- But now, we have nothing to be afraid of...
Our contract will not exist if we destroy the evidence.
I stand to gain nothing from you now so I must destroy you.
Am I right...?
We did everything you told us to do!
That is correct...
And now you'll have to show your loyalty to me once again.
Onizo, will you please kill Kikyo?
!
Shino was my daughter...
You told me that you wanted a place where the Yokai could live peacefully.
It was good idea but if humans live with you in your area, that's not very good.
If humans and Yokai mix together there will be trouble in the future.
Just like we have now...
We know how much you adore Kikyo, so if you kill her you will prove your loyalty to Yamaji-sama!
If you kill Kikyo, I will let the others go.
It's not too bad a deal...
What's the matter, Onizo?
It's for our dream!
There's no choice!
This is going to be quite a show...
Kikyo...
It's alright...
As long as I can go to paradise...
It's alright...
What paradise...?
The Yokai go to hell...
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Move!
He is a tough one!
- Get out of my way!
- Move!
Forgive me...
I've decided to become Yamaji-sama's man...
Take this!
You monster...
The Yokai's appearance is very different than humans...
Kikyo...
I will never let anyone ruin your beauty...
Your prayer has been answered.
I am sure that Onizo went to paradise.
I'm sure of it...
Where are you going?
Wherever you go, the Yokai will be chased by humans.
That is our fate...
Do not mix with them...
Just live quietly until your time comes...
I'm going to find a place where I can live with this child.
You will find it...
There must be somewhere...
A place of our own and for you as well, Kibakichi-san.
I can't bear to think of you in bed with Frank.
Then don't, cos we don't do that.
Doctor's orders.
He's got a dodgy heart.
Let's round the evening off with some one-on-one physiotherapy.
Are you mad or what?
- Here, mate, how safe's that thing?
Not one accident in ten years.
Whoa!
- Roger!
Get me down!
- Don't be stupid!
Help!
Oh, my God!
You two getting reacquainted?
Don't bother doing up your flies.
Your whore's waiting for you.
Who are you calling a whore?
- Shut up, bitch.
Amber!
'Conrad, I've been kidnapped.
I told you they'd come back.
'They want more money.'
- What?
Kyle?
Hey, hey, it's OK.
It's OK.
Bad dream?
It's just the pills.
I wasn't talking any rubbish, was I?
- No.
Just a lot of tossing and turning.
So you're still taking the painkillers, then?
Yeah.
They help me sleep.
Not very well, by the look of it.
No, I'm all right.
Morning.
Sleep all right?
It was the best wedding night ever.
- I love you, Mrs Lawson.
I love you, Mr Lawson.
Do you feel any like...
I don't know... different?
Mm, just married.
I could hear them dogs all last night.
Shannon, there's a shitting lion out there.
Lion?
Don't talk soft, it's not frigging Africa.
'Conrad!
'
- Amber, what the hell's?
'I'm trying to tell you!
They want a million.'
A million?
- 'Just get me out of this hellhole.
'You will get me out, won't you?
'
- Of course.
'I'm so frightened!
'
- Amber!
Jesus.
You shouldn't have chucked your shoes at it.
God, we're gonna die!
Are you feeling better?
- Mm.
What are you staring at?
- You.
You're gorgeous.
I don't do this, Kyle.
I don't just fall into bed with my clients.
The club would go mad if they found out.
This isn't part of rehab, OK?
And I'm not a football groupie, either.
- So you think I'm into groupies?
Yeah, well, I know the game.
You've got everything for you on a plate.
I mean, I see the girls waiting outside the club every day.
I never look at them.
And for the record, I don't "do this", either.
After Chardonnay died, well, I thought that was it for me.
But then you came along...
Yeah, to kick you into shape and give you your career back.
I'm serious.
- Yeah?
Well, so am I.
But you're gonna have to work for it.
Oh, really?
- Mm.
What you doing?
- I need it!
I'm gonna get eaten and I don't want to know about it.
How are we gonna get out of here if you're pissed?
So much for love and protect.
- They never said nothing about lions.
They've found us!
Oh, my God!
We're gonna be saved.
Over here, mister!
Oh, yes!
Madame.
Are you expecting guests?
- No, just one very special lady.
Hm.
Well, shall I go out and buy an evening gown?
No, you look gorgeous.
I want to propose a toast.
- Kyle, look...
This is really lovely and everything but I'm not royalty.
Cheers.
- I just want you to have a bit of luxury.
I have actually drunk champagne, you know?
I didn't mean it like that.
I just...
Well, I wanted to show you how I feel.
You did.
Last night.
So, what's your problem?
The problem is...
I'm not Chardonnay.
All this...
Well, it just isn't me.
Great way to spend your wedding night.
How is it to be out?
It's fantastic.
Now we just want to get home.
Let's have a few pictures.
Step over here, would you?
Stand by the lion, shall we?
- A shot of the blushing bride.
That's great, that's great.
Lovely nails.
Show us your claws, will you?
Bigger, bigger.
That's great.
That's it.
Yeah!
Now give us a lion.
Rrrrr!
- Shan, I'm gonna get slaughtered.
Two minutes, love.
- Harley, maybe one from you?
Lovely, yeah.
Show us how fierce you are.
That's great.
How much did that boy cost us again?
You'd better have a replacement.
You can't hold me responsible for...
- Get out the way.
'... turned up safe and well this morning.
We have few details... '
Oh, thank Christ.
- '... but reports suggest 'that Lawson managed to pilot the balloon 'and crash land in the lion enclosure of a safari park.
'The drama unfolded at Lawson's wedding to Shannon Donnelly.'
Right.
Press conference here this afternoon.
I've got training.
Lawson's got training.
Work around it.
Listen, Webbsy, there's a hundred sodding journalists out there all wanting a story with Phileas bloody Fogg.
And let's face it, Lawson's already faced one pack of lions today.
Voila!
That's more like it.
Hang on, I'll just get this.
- OK.
That should keep you in bacon sarnies for a while.
You've won 45 grand?
You're joking!
- I only play to win, darling.
Cup of char?
So did you get home OK from the wedding of the year?
You know what they say - never mix Scousers with hot air.
Look, Tanya, I'm right in the middle of stuff.
Do you want to meet up after training?
I can give Frank the slip.
I can't.
- Well, tomorrow, then.
'The morning's probably better for me.'
I feel like I'm begging now.
So when do you want to meet?
Tanya, I think you're amazing.
'A really amazing woman.'
Sounds like there's a but coming.
'I can't see you any more.'
I've got a lot going on right now and I can't do this.
Conrad?
Listen, er...
I'm sorry about last night.
That... doesn't usually happen to me.
No need to apologise, Frank.
Most men complain when they can't get it up.
I feel like I've got a new lease of life.
See?
I told you we'd be good together.
Listen, I've got to get off, watch the lads train.
Well, why don't I come with you?
When have you ever wanted to watch a butch of muddy bastards run around a football field?
I thought you wanted your wife on your arm, Frank.
As far as I'm aware that was never the case.
Christ almighty!
You been on a bender?
I need to talk to you.
Alone.
Bye, Rog.
Training ground by three.
You shouldn't indulge him.
Not exactly a new man, is he?
Talk.
It's Amber.
Ain't it always?
- Christ.
I don't even think I can say it.
Amber's been kidnapped.
Come again?
- They'll kill her unless I pay a ransom.
I thought you'd paid 'em off?
- So did I.
Well, how much?
A million by Friday.
- Huh!
I can get half of it but I thought...
- Conrad, I ain't a bloody magician.
Look, if you want me at this club, then you'll get the rest.
What about your transfer fee?
- It's tied up in trust funds.
Look, if you won't help me, then all I've got left is the police.
If it gets out about your Chinese friends, you're finished as a footballer.
I don't give a shit about football.
All I want is my wife back.
For Christ's sake.
Hold on a minute.
I'll lend you the money, OK?
Thanks.
Stay up, stay tight.
Here, Noah!
Get inside, stay inside!
- Go on!
Ah!
- Give me the ball.
I'd put money on Gates not seeing out his contract.
Mind you, there is a penalty if he does the dirty on us.
There is always a penalty, not seeing out your contract, Tanya.
I'm sure nobody'd dare turn you over, Frank.
Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Hurt did it?
Perhaps if you got to training on time, you'd learn how to stay on your feet.
I just needed to talk to Hazel.
Oh, yeah?
What about?
- It's private.
Listen, I know you've been in Italy, where Mamma pays the wages, but over here, that's all she does - just pay the wages, OK?
I run this football team.
You'd better start remembering that.
All right, chaps, in the showers.
I was thinking of going to Fabric later.
You up for it?
Nah, I've got something on.
- Going out with this lot?
They never asked me.
- No, I'm seeing someone.
Oh, right!
Go on, what's she like?
Fantastic.
Maybe we could talk over dinner.
Why would we be having dinner?
- It's not like I'm gonna to say anything.
I just wanna see you.
- Look, if I was looking for a boyfriend...
But I'm not, all right?
Any broken bones?
- No.
You will have if you go AWOL again.
- I'm really sorry, Miss Bailey, but it were an accident.
- Yeah?
Well, that's exactly what I want you to tell the press.
All you've got to do is smile, keep it simple...
I'll handle this.
I'm not having this turning into another media circus.
Fancy yourself as ringmaster, do you?
Be my guest.
Come on, let's go over here.
Mr Webb!
Mr Webb!
- Er, yes.
So, how did you manage to escape the lions?
You must have been terrified.
Not really.
Just kept me cool, you know.
As long as you show no fear, they leave you alone.
They're just big cats, really.
Mr Webb!
Mr Webb!
- Hello?
Can yous all hear me at the back?
Harley was dead brave.
Them lions were wild, tearing away at anything they could get their teeth into.
We were bricking it, weren't we?
Yeah, well, as you can see, they're both back safe and sound.
But in the end, one of the rangers came out in a van and saved us.
We was dead lucky cos they were ravenous.
His name's Andy.
He had a Crocodile Dundee hat on and everything.
Er, yes.
- Was alcohol a factor in the crash?
Are you worried by this resurgence of the drinking culture at Earls Park?
Listen, mate, there is no drinking culture at this club.
All right, boys and girls.
Let's talk facts.
Alcohol is not the issue here.
Yeah, they'd had a couple of drinks.
They'd just got married!
What do you expect them to be drinking, Evian?
No, the real issue here is safety.
And what this club wants to know is how these two were able to just up and away with no regulation, no supervision.
Now, if there are no more questions...
- Mr Webb!
Mr Webb!
Good.
That'll be all, then.
You just can't help yourself, can you?
You are gonna have to work bloody hard to get back in my good books, Lawson.
I'm telling you two.
You give the press nothing except what you want to read.
And to make sure there's nothing you can give them, lover boy here's on a no-booze rule.
Clubs, pubs, drinking at home - they're all out.
You can't tell him what to do at home.
Can't I?
- No way.
It's me is his wife.
And it's me is telling you how to be a good one.
What are we gonna tell our mates?
- Look, love, it's my Jag, you just park it.
Huh!
Harley!
I know I need a bloody drink.
Frank, I forgot.
I've got a hair appointment in half an hour.
Can you drop me off at the salon?
- Tanya, I'm exhausted.
Just drop me where I can get a cab then.
There is nothing wrong with your hair.
Get in, we're going home.
Fine.
You're keeping me prisoner so I might as well look like one.
Don't complain when the press laugh at us.
Oh, bloody hell.
Where is this salon, then?
So where's Amber, then?
It's not like her to miss a threesome.
Come on, Conrad, I'm not the only one who's noticed she's not been around.
She's visiting her mother, all right?
I'm not some cheap tart you can pick up and drop when it suits you, you know.
You know fashion - one day you're in, the next you're out.
Bollocks.
You certainly didn't think I was last season yesterday.
Talk to me, Conrad.
I'm risking my marriage for you.
If Frank ever finds out...
- Then don't risk it.
I'm not asking you to!
Just forget about me, Tanya.
But we're fantastic together.
Baby, you OK?
Jesus, Amber.
I'm not dropping a million quid in a wood.
Who's to say they'll let you go, anyway?
I take it she's not shopping in Milan, then?
My God.
So you're going through all this on your own?
And there's me going on about us.
Jesus, you must be going out of your mind, especially as it's the same people who chopped up her dog.
I don't know what to do, Tanya.
I feel terrible.
If she hadn't seen us at the wedding, she wouldn't have bolted and...
This is all my fault.
- They'd have got to her anyway.
Don't give up.
There's still hope, darling.
She's not dead yet.
What are the police doing?
The police don't know.
I can't tell them.
If I tell anyone, they'll kill her.
Hello, darling.
You are gonna love me.
Oh, yeah.
It's front page without a doubt.
But this can never come from me.
Ever.
Is that the cash?
I owe you one, Hazel.
- Yeah, you do.
And there's interest, too.
I want that paid in goals.
Here, Shan.
Must be the wedding pictures.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe we're gonna be in Hello!
Look at Kev's arse!
Ugh, look at Amber Gates all over poor Father Doyle.
Dirty mare.
Not as bad as what Daisy's doing, look.
With your Kev, and all.
The bridesmaid's meant to cop off with the best man.
'Ey, this'll be our cheque.
"Dear Mr...
"We enclose a set of photographs taken at your wedding.
"Unfortunately none of these are suitable for publishing in Hello!
magazine
"due to lack of cooperation on your part.
"Therefore it is with much regret
"that we are unable to honour our part of the agreement."
Your stupid balloon's gone and done that!
Me?
Your stupid rat-arsed brother and his mates, more like.
Hazel's right, Shan.
We've got to clean our act up.
Shit.
All right, Pascoe?
Jesus!
You've just lost 600K?
Don't worry.
A sunglasses contract'll see to that.
Hmm.
- Oh, come on, babe.
You know how hard I've been working to get back.
This is just a bit of fun.
From where I'm standing, looks like a problem.
'lt's me, it's Amber.'
- Amber!
Did they get the money?
Yeah, they got the money.
Oh, Conrad!
You did it!
You didn't let me down.
They're gonna let me go.
- Oh, thank God.
When?
- Well, I don't know but soon.
I'm gonna get to see you soon, Conrad.
'Bye.
I love you.'
What?
- She's coming home, H!
Watch the suit!
Good.
Now we can get back to some football.
'Mr Gates?
'
- Who is it?
'Barry Maynard from the Star.'
It's about the disappearance of your wife.
Any comment?
Oh, Jesus!
It's the Star.
What do you want?
'Barry Maynard... '
- Get your pad out.
'There is no disappearance, there is no story.'
End of.
I reckon if I really get my head down, I could get some decent pictures.
Take some of me, if you want.
I'm practically a model, now.
There's some cracking views in London.
I might take a shot of that Dome.
You know, put a filter on, make it a bit special and send it to me mam for her birthday.
- Sod the flaming Dome!
I've got a couple here that need focusing on.
I'm not gonna get a chance to show them off, seeing as I'm a hermit now.
Hazel didn't say we can't go out, she said we can't go out on t'piss.
It'd be more fun married to a plumber.
Come on!
I think it's nice.
You and me, staying in, spending time together.
And all that.
'The proceeds from this evening's event will all be going to local charities.'
'There's growing speculation tonight 'over the whereabouts of the wife of England football captain Conrad Gates.
'Rumours of a split are rife... '
- Shit!
'... as their relationship has grown increasingly stormy.
'The actress has not been seen for days.
As yet the police have not been involved.
'Meanwhile, Conrad Gates is believed to be very concerned about his wife.
'He's being comforted at his Highgate home by friends.
'We'll keep you updated throughout the evening.'
Let's see how Bailey copes now.
It takes balls, this game, real balls.
Do you reckon it is a split or is there something else going on?
Put it this way - if it's the curry specialists again,
Bailey's gonna have more on her plate than a fried dog.
Earls Park's never been so exciting.
I think I need a lie-down.
How about you?
And just a lie-down, mind you, OK?
Fine.
I'll bring the drinks.
Where is she?
They've killed her, I know they have.
Conrad!
- The whole world knows she's missing.
I need to check out, please.
You're leaving early, madam.
Was everything to your satisfaction?
Yes, it was fine, thank you.
Can I get my bill?
If you'd like to fill out your details,
I'll make sure you receive notice of any offers at Oldbury Hall.
Listen, I've got a plane to catch and a taxi waiting, so if you could hurry up, please.
Leave it.
Thank you.
That was amazing.
- Oh, Jesus.
This is me going against my doctors' orders.
They told me to take it easy.
- Oh, what do the doctors know?
Wasn't so long ago they wanted to switch off your life support.
You were cheering them on, as I recall.
Oh, Frank.
I think your heart's in better shape than they're telling you.
It's got to be to keep pumping you up like this.
Well, unless those pills are Viagra.
One... two... three... four... five, six, seven, eight nine, ten, eleven, twelve thirteen, fourteen.
Please help me.
I've been kidnapped.
Sorry but we do need to ask you a number of questions.
I want to see my husband.
All in good time, Mrs Gates.
Did you see your abductor?
No.
I told you, I didn't see anything until I was dumped in the woods and I took the blindfold off.
But you did hear his voice.
Can you describe it?
I just want this to end.
Mrs Gates, you're going to have to tell us everything.
Was there a ransom demand?
Was any money handed over?
Look, he was a mad fan, he knew all about my films and he said he wanted me to get him a part.
Where were you held?
- I don't know.
Were you driven?
- It was all really confusing.
How did you escape, Mrs Gates?
I'm too tired.
Mrs Gates, we have to ask.
Was there any sexual assault?
No!
I told you, he was a bloody nutter.
There must be thousands of them out there.
Move back, please.
Conrad!
- I thought I'd lost you.
I thought that was it.
- So did I.
Ah!
Thank God I've got you back.
- I was so scared, Conrad.
Oh, babes.
You'll never let anyone come between us again, will you, Conrad?
It's just me and you, now.
Promise me!
I so you need you to.
- I promise you.
You're my everything.
'A relieved Conrad Gates was reunited with his actress wife Amber tonight.
'Police say Mrs Gates was abducted and held captive by a deranged film fan 'but the actress has insisted that she suffered no physical harm.' 'lt's been a terrible time, we're just glad it's over.'
'I was just... just very lucky.
'The guy basically did it out of a kind of love for me 'and he knew he shouldn't have and I think that's why he let me go.'
'We just hope, if he's listening, 'he'll come forward so he can get some help.'
'One more question... ' - 'Over here, over here... '
'Now back to Dawn in the studio.'
Well done, chaps.
Well!
Finally!
It seems you gentlemen have decided to play some football.
Gates, I want another goal in the second half.
Hayward, get into Marshall, just knock him off the ball.
Now listen up.
We win today, it's not just three points.
It's the first win over United.
Now, I came to Sparks to break some records, so let's break 'em.
Hello, Tanya.
Join me in a drink?
A bottle of Cristal, please.
If Conrad hadn't begged me to come, I would never have left the house.
It's been absolutely awful.
I've been too frightened to go out.
So they found you in Oldbury Woods.
Well, to be quite honest with you, I didn't know where in the world I was.
He kept me blindfolded and tied up most of the time.
I remember scratching away at the rope, you know, trying to loosen it but of course it was no use.
In the end, I realised that I just had to keep him talking.
Thank God that's all he wanted, eh?
Well, here's to freedom.
Bet you didn't think I'd make it.
Wouldn't put anything past you, Amber.
All's well that ends well, eh?
Fraternising with the enemy?
She looks very good for someone who's been locked up all week.
Tell you what, H, if I ever get kidnapped,
I hope they stash me somewhere near Oldbury Health Farm.
In fact, I might give them a ring, see if they've got a room for tonight.
I need to get my chakras energised.
- Well, you know what energises her.
And I know what energises his football.
Ah!
Here comes the prodigal son.
Roger.
- Kyle!
Remember this place, do you?
This is commonly known as the players' lounge.
P-L-A-Y-E-R, player.
That's you.
Time's not on your side, son, so you'd better speed up the recovery or you'll be needing a guest pass
- Lucky I've got my physio, then.
Yeah, how's he getting on, Elaine?
- Yeah, all right.
All right?
Just all right?
We're not paying you to watch daytime TV and get your back rubbed, so pull your finger out.
Are you trying to ruin my career?
He doesn't need an excuse to kick me out.
He wants you back and you'd be back a hell of a lot quicker if you concentrate on training, not gambling.
I was gonna take you out for dinner but you know what?
I lost my appetite.
Hey!
Well done.
You looked part of the team today.
Cheers.
I were made up when it went in.
It's boss when you score at home.
Mr Webb, don't you reckon he deserves a bevy later to celebrate?
We've been ever so good.
We've haven't touched a drop.
That's why he scored today, love.
So stay good cos it's obviously working.
'Hi, this is the Lasletts.
'Sorry we can't take your call, please leave a message and we'll call you back.'
'Hi, darling.
'The boys will be celebrating so Hazel's arranged a girls' night out.'
I imagine it'll be a late one so I'll stay over at hers.
I've got my mobile with me.
'I imagine you probably could do with a good night's sleep anyway.'
OK.
Bye.
Kyle!
Wait!
Why, so you can stab me in the back again?
Can't you think of anyone but yourself?
Go on, mate, take this.
- Cheers.
Roger's my boss and as far as he knows, I'm just your physio.
So sorry I'm not singing your praises and telling him you're great in bed.
But when we're here, Earls Park's my work and you're my client.
Fine.
- I'm taking you for dinner, so let's go.
This is harder than one of your physio sessions, you know that?
You couldn't do me a massive favour, could you, darling?
Oh, my God.
Can you bring up camera 3?
Can you zoom in on that?
Stop.
That clear enough for you?
Crystal.
He said whatever I've been doing seems to have worked wonders.
There's been no more deterioration.
I could last maybe a year at this rate.
Great!
That's great news.
I understand that you do... eliminations.
Ah!
A curse!
It takes time.
- I don't care what it takes.
I want it done.
Water?
Do you want water?
I can't bear to think of you in bed with Frank.
Then don't, cos we don't do that.
Doctor's orders.
He's got a dodgy heart.
Let's round the evening off with some one-on-one physiotherapy.
Are you mad or what?
- Here, mate, how safe's that thing?
Not one accident in ten years.
Whoa!
- Roger!
Get me down!
- Don't be stupid!
Help!
Oh, my God!
You two getting reacquainted?
Don't bother doing up your flies.
Your whore's waiting for you.
Who are you calling a whore?
- Shut up, bitch.
Amber!
(Giggling)
(Roaring)
(Amber) 'Conrad, I've been kidnapped.
I told you they'd come back.
'They want more money.'
- What?
Kyle?
Hey, hey, it's OK.
It's OK.
(Sighs)
- Bad dream?
It's just the pills.
I wasn't talking any rubbish, was I?
- (Chuckles) No.
Just a lot of tossing and turning.
So you're still taking the painkillers, then?
Yeah.
They help me sleep.
Not very well, by the look of it.
No, I'm all right.
Morning.
Sleep all right?
It was the best wedding night ever.
- I love you, Mrs Lawson.
I love you, Mr Lawson.
Do you feel any like...
I don't know... different?
Mm, just married.
(Roaring)
- I could hear them dogs all last night.
Shannon, there's a shitting lion out there.
Lion?
Don't talk soft, it's not frigging Africa.
(Mobile)
'Conrad!
'
- Amber, what the hell's?
'I'm trying to tell you!
They want a million.'
A million?
- 'Just get me out of this hellhole.
'You will get me out, won't you?
'
- Of course.
'I'm so frightened!
'
- Amber!
(Dialling tone)
Jesus.
You shouldn't have chucked your shoes at it.
(Roars) - (Shrieks) God, we're gonna die!
Are you feeling better?
- Mm.
What are you staring at?
- You.
You're gorgeous.
I don't do this, Kyle.
I don't just fall into bed with my clients.
The club would go mad if they found out.
This isn't part of rehab, OK?
And I'm not a football groupie, either.
- So you think I'm into groupies?
Yeah, well, I know the game.
You've got everything for you on a plate.
I mean, I see the girls waiting outside the club every day.
I never look at them.
And for the record, I don't "do this", either.
After Chardonnay died, well, I thought that was it for me.
But then you came along...
Yeah, to kick you into shape and give you your career back.
I'm serious.
- Yeah?
Well, so am I.
But you're gonna have to work for it.
Oh, really?
- Mm.
(Roaring)
What you doing?
- I need it!
I'm gonna get eaten and I don't want to know about it.
How are we gonna get out of here if you're pissed?
So much for love and protect.
- They never said nothing about lions.
(Horn beeping)
- They've found us!
Oh, my God!
We're gonna be saved.
Over here, mister!
Oh, yes!
Madame.
Are you expecting guests?
- No, just one very special lady.
Hm.
Well, shall I go out and buy an evening gown?
No, you look gorgeous.
I want to propose a toast.
- Kyle, look...
This is really lovely and everything but I'm not royalty.
Cheers.
- I just want you to have a bit of luxury.
I have actually drunk champagne, you know?
I didn't mean it like that.
I just...
Well, I wanted to show you how I feel.
You did.
Last night.
So, what's your problem?
The problem is...
I'm not Chardonnay.
All this...
Well, it just isn't me.
(Reporter) Great way to spend your wedding night.
How is it to be out?
It's fantastic.
Now we just want to get home.
Let's have a few pictures.
Step over here, would you?
Stand by the lion, shall we?
- A shot of the blushing bride.
That's great, that's great.
Lovely nails.
Show us your claws, will you?
Bigger, bigger.
That's great.
That's it.
Yeah!
Now give us a lion.
Rrrrr!
- Shan, I'm gonna get slaughtered.
Two minutes, love.
- Harley, maybe one from you?
Lovely, yeah.
Show us how fierce you are.
That's great.
How much did that boy cost us again?
You'd better have a replacement.
You can't hold me responsible for...
- Get out the way.
'... turned up safe and well this morning.
We have few details... '
Oh, thank Christ.
- '... but reports suggest 'that Lawson managed to pilot the balloon 'and crash land in the lion enclosure of a safari park.
'The drama unfolded at Lawson's wedding to Shannon Donnelly.'
Right.
Press conference here this afternoon.
I've got training.
Lawson's got training.
Work around it.
Listen, Webbsy, there's a hundred sodding journalists out there all wanting a story with Phileas bloody Fogg.
And let's face it, Lawson's already faced one pack of lions today.
Voila!
That's more like it.
- (Mobile)
Hang on, I'll just get this.
- OK.
That should keep you in bacon sarnies for a while.
You've won 45 grand?
You're joking!
- I only play to win, darling.
Cup of char?
(Mobile)
(Sighs)
So did you get home OK from the wedding of the year?
You know what they say - never mix Scousers with hot air.
Look, Tanya, I'm right in the middle of stuff.
Do you want to meet up after training?
I can give Frank the slip.
I can't.
- Well, tomorrow, then.
'The morning's probably better for me.'
I feel like I'm begging now.
So when do you want to meet?
Tanya, I think you're amazing.
'A really amazing woman.'
Sounds like there's a but coming.
'I can't see you any more.'
I've got a lot going on right now and I can't do this.
Conrad?
Listen, er...
I'm sorry about last night.
That... doesn't usually happen to me.
No need to apologise, Frank.
Most men complain when they can't get it up.
I feel like I've got a new lease of life.
See?
I told you we'd be good together.
Listen, I've got to get off, watch the lads train.
Well, why don't I come with you?
When have you ever wanted to watch a butch of muddy bastards run around a football field?
I thought you wanted your wife on your arm, Frank.
(Roger) As far as I'm aware that was never the case.
Christ almighty!
You been on a bender?
I need to talk to you.
Alone.
Bye, Rog.
Training ground by three.
You shouldn't indulge him.
Not exactly a new man, is he?
Talk.
It's Amber.
Ain't it always?
- (Sighs) Christ.
I don't even think I can say it.
Amber's been kidnapped.
Come again?
- They'll kill her unless I pay a ransom.
I thought you'd paid 'em off?
- So did I.
Well, how much?
A million by Friday.
- Huh!
I can get half of it but I thought...
- Conrad, I ain't a bloody magician.
Look, if you want me at this club, then you'll get the rest.
What about your transfer fee?
- It's tied up in trust funds.
Look, if you won't help me, then all I've got left is the police.
If it gets out about your Chinese friends, you're finished as a footballer.
I don't give a shit about football.
All I want is my wife back.
(Sighs) For Christ's sake.
Hold on a minute.
I'll lend you the money, OK?
Thanks.
Stay up, stay tight.
Here, Noah!
Get inside, stay inside!
- Go on!
Ah!
- Give me the ball.
(Frank) I'd put money on Gates not seeing out his contract.
Mind you, there is a penalty if he does the dirty on us.
There is always a penalty, not seeing out your contract, Tanya.
I'm sure nobody'd dare turn you over, Frank.
Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Hurt did it?
Perhaps if you got to training on time, you'd learn how to stay on your feet.
I just needed to talk to Hazel.
Oh, yeah?
What about?
- It's private.
Listen, I know you've been in Italy, where Mamma pays the wages, but over here, that's all she does - just pay the wages, OK?
I run this football team.
You'd better start remembering that.
All right, chaps, in the showers.
I was thinking of going to Fabric later.
You up for it?
Nah, I've got something on.
- Going out with this lot?
They never asked me.
- No, I'm seeing someone.
Oh, right!
Go on, what's she like?
Fantastic.
Maybe we could talk over dinner.
Why would we be having dinner?
- It's not like I'm gonna to say anything.
I just wanna see you.
- Look, if I was looking for a boyfriend...
But I'm not, all right?
Any broken bones?
- No.
You will have if you go AWOL again.
- I'm really sorry, Miss Bailey, but it were an accident.
- Yeah?
Well, that's exactly what I want you to tell the press.
All you've got to do is smile, keep it simple...
I'll handle this.
I'm not having this turning into another media circus.
Fancy yourself as ringmaster, do you?
Be my guest.
Come on, let's go over here.
Mr Webb!
Mr Webb!
- Er, yes.
So, how did you manage to escape the lions?
You must have been terrified.
Not really.
Just kept me cool, you know.
As long as you show no fear, they leave you alone.
They're just big cats, really.
(Reporters) Mr Webb!
Mr Webb!
- Hello?
Can yous all hear me at the back?
Harley was dead brave.
Them lions were wild, tearing away at anything they could get their teeth into.
We were bricking it, weren't we?
Yeah, well, as you can see, they're both back safe and sound.
But in the end, one of the rangers came out in a van and saved us.
We was dead lucky cos they were ravenous.
His name's Andy.
He had a Crocodile Dundee hat on and everything.
Er, yes.
- Was alcohol a factor in the crash?
Are you worried by this resurgence of the drinking culture at Earls Park?
Listen, mate, there is no drinking culture at this club.
All right, boys and girls.
Let's talk facts.
Alcohol is not the issue here.
Yeah, they'd had a couple of drinks.
They'd just got married!
What do you expect them to be drinking, Evian?
No, the real issue here is safety.
And what this club wants to know is how these two were able to just up and away with no regulation, no supervision.
Now, if there are no more questions...
- Mr Webb!
Mr Webb!
Good.
That'll be all, then.
You just can't help yourself, can you?
You are gonna have to work bloody hard to get back in my good books, Lawson.
I'm telling you two.
You give the press nothing except what you want to read.
And to make sure there's nothing you can give them, lover boy here's on a no-booze rule.
Clubs, pubs, drinking at home - they're all out.
You can't tell him what to do at home.
Can't I?
- No way.
It's me is his wife.
And it's me is telling you how to be a good one.
What are we gonna tell our mates?
- Look, love, it's my Jag, you just park it.
Huh!
Harley!
I know I need a bloody drink.
Frank, I forgot.
I've got a hair appointment in half an hour.
Can you drop me off at the salon?
- Tanya, I'm exhausted.
Just drop me where I can get a cab then.
There is nothing wrong with your hair.
Get in, we're going home.
Fine.
You're keeping me prisoner so I might as well look like one.
Don't complain when the press laugh at us.
Oh, bloody hell.
Where is this salon, then?
So where's Amber, then?
It's not like her to miss a threesome.
Come on, Conrad, I'm not the only one who's noticed she's not been around.
She's visiting her mother, all right?
I'm not some cheap tart you can pick up and drop when it suits you, you know.
You know fashion - one day you're in, the next you're out.
Bollocks.
You certainly didn't think I was last season yesterday.
Talk to me, Conrad.
I'm risking my marriage for you.
If Frank ever finds out...
- Then don't risk it.
I'm not asking you to!
Just forget about me, Tanya.
But we're fantastic together.
(Mobile)
Baby, you OK?
Jesus, Amber.
I'm not dropping a million quid in a wood.
Who's to say they'll let you go, anyway?
I take it she's not shopping in Milan, then?
My God.
So you're going through all this on your own?
And there's me going on about us.
Jesus, you must be going out of your mind, especially as it's the same people who chopped up her dog.
I don't know what to do, Tanya.
I feel terrible.
If she hadn't seen us at the wedding, she wouldn't have bolted and...
This is all my fault.
- They'd have got to her anyway.
Don't give up.
There's still hope, darling.
She's not dead yet.
What are the police doing?
The police don't know.
I can't tell them.
If I tell anyone, they'll kill her.
Hello, darling.
You are gonna love me.
Oh, yeah.
It's front page without a doubt.
But this can never come from me.
Ever.
Is that the cash?
I owe you one, Hazel.
- Yeah, you do.
And there's interest, too.
I want that paid in goals.
Here, Shan.
Must be the wedding pictures.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe we're gonna be in Hello!
Look at Kev's arse!
Ugh, look at Amber Gates all over poor Father Doyle.
Dirty mare.
Not as bad as what Daisy's doing, look.
With your Kev, and all.
The bridesmaid's meant to cop off with the best man.
'Ey, this'll be our cheque.
"Dear Mr...
"We enclose a set of photographs taken at your wedding.
"Unfortunately none of these are suitable for publishing in Hello!
magazine
"due to lack of cooperation on your part.
"Therefore it is with much regret
"that we are unable to honour our part of the agreement."
Your stupid balloon's gone and done that!
Me?
Your stupid rat-arsed brother and his mates, more like.
Hazel's right, Shan.
We've got to clean our act up.
Shit.
All right, Pascoe?
Jesus!
You've just lost 600K?
Don't worry.
A sunglasses contract'll see to that.
Hmm.
- Oh, come on, babe.
You know how hard I've been working to get back.
This is just a bit of fun.
From where I'm standing, looks like a problem.
(Mobile) 'lt's me, it's Amber.'
- Amber!
Did they get the money?
Yeah, they got the money.
Oh, Conrad!
You did it!
You didn't let me down.
They're gonna let me go.
- Oh, thank God.
When?
- Well, I don't know but soon.
I'm gonna get to see you soon, Conrad.
'Bye.
I love you.'
What?
- She's coming home, H!
Watch the suit!
Good.
Now we can get back to some football.
- (Door buzzer)
(Man) 'Mr Gates?
'
- Who is it?
'Barry Maynard from the Star.'
It's about the disappearance of your wife.
Any comment?
Oh, Jesus!
It's the Star.
(Sighs)
What do you want?
'Barry Maynard... '
- Get your pad out.
'There is no disappearance, there is no story.'
End of.
I reckon if I really get my head down, I could get some decent pictures.
Take some of me, if you want.
I'm practically a model, now.
There's some cracking views in London.
I might take a shot of that Dome.
You know, put a filter on, make it a bit special and send it to me mam for her birthday.
- Sod the flaming Dome!
I've got a couple here that need focusing on.
I'm not gonna get a chance to show them off, seeing as I'm a hermit now.
Hazel didn't say we can't go out, she said we can't go out on t'piss.
It'd be more fun married to a plumber.
Come on!
I think it's nice.
You and me, staying in, spending time together.
And all that.
'The proceeds from this evening's event will all be going to local charities.'
'There's growing speculation tonight 'over the whereabouts of the wife of England football captain Conrad Gates.
'Rumours of a split are rife... '
- Shit!
'... as their relationship has grown increasingly stormy.
'The actress has not been seen for days.
As yet the police have not been involved.
'Meanwhile, Conrad Gates is believed to be very concerned about his wife.
'He's being comforted at his Highgate home by friends.
'We'll keep you updated throughout the evening.'
(Laughs) Let's see how Bailey copes now.
It takes balls, this game, real balls.
Do you reckon it is a split or is there something else going on?
Put it this way - if it's the curry specialists again,
Bailey's gonna have more on her plate than a fried dog.
Earls Park's never been so exciting.
I think I need a lie-down.
How about you?
And just a lie-down, mind you, OK?
Fine.
I'll bring the drinks.
(Sighs)
(Camera shutters clicking)
Where is she?
They've killed her, I know they have.
Conrad!
- The whole world knows she's missing.
I need to check out, please.
You're leaving early, madam.
Was everything to your satisfaction?
Yes, it was fine, thank you.
Can I get my bill?
If you'd like to fill out your details,
I'll make sure you receive notice of any offers at Oldbury Hall.
Listen, I've got a plane to catch and a taxi waiting, so if you could hurry up, please.
Leave it.
Thank you.
(Snores)
That was amazing.
- Oh, Jesus.
This is me going against my doctors' orders.
They told me to take it easy.
- Oh, what do the doctors know?
Wasn't so long ago they wanted to switch off your life support.
You were cheering them on, as I recall.
Oh, Frank.
I think your heart's in better shape than they're telling you.
It's got to be to keep pumping you up like this.
Well, unless those pills are Viagra.
(Chuckles)
(Sighs)
One... two... three... four... five, six, seven, eight nine, ten, eleven, twelve thirteen, fourteen.
(Horn blaring) - (Sobbing)
Please help me.
I've been kidnapped.
(Sobbing)
Sorry but we do need to ask you a number of questions.
I want to see my husband.
All in good time, Mrs Gates.
Did you see your abductor?
No.
I told you, I didn't see anything until I was dumped in the woods and I took the blindfold off.
But you did hear his voice.
Can you describe it?
I just want this to end.
Mrs Gates, you're going to have to tell us everything.
Was there a ransom demand?
Was any money handed over?
Look, he was a mad fan, he knew all about my films and he said he wanted me to get him a part.
Where were you held?
- I don't know.
Were you driven?
- It was all really confusing.
How did you escape, Mrs Gates?
(Sobs) I'm too tired.
Mrs Gates, we have to ask.
Was there any sexual assault?
No!
I told you, he was a bloody nutter.
There must be thousands of them out there.
(Siren)
(Camera shutters)
- Move back, please.
Conrad!
- I thought I'd lost you.
I thought that was it.
- So did I.
Ah!
Thank God I've got you back.
- I was so scared, Conrad.
Oh, babes.
You'll never let anyone come between us again, will you, Conrad?
It's just me and you, now.
Promise me!
I so you need you to.
- I promise you.
You're my everything.
(Reporters shouting)
'A relieved Conrad Gates was reunited with his actress wife Amber tonight.
'Police say Mrs Gates was abducted and held captive by a deranged film fan 'but the actress has insisted that she suffered no physical harm.'
(Conrad) 'lt's been a terrible time, we're just glad it's over.'
'I was just... just very lucky.
'The guy basically did it out of a kind of love for me 'and he knew he shouldn't have and I think that's why he let me go.'
'We just hope, if he's listening, 'he'll come forward so he can get some help.'
'One more question... ' - 'Over here, over here... '
'Now back to Dawn in the studio.'
(Crowd cheering)
Well done, chaps.
Well!
Finally!
It seems you gentlemen have decided to play some football.
Gates, I want another goal in the second half.
Hayward, get into Marshall, just knock him off the ball.
Now listen up.
We win today, it's not just three points.
It's the first win over United.
Now, I came to Sparks to break some records, so let's break 'em.
- (Cheering)
Hello, Tanya.
Join me in a drink?
A bottle of Cristal, please.
If Conrad hadn't begged me to come, I would never have left the house.
It's been absolutely awful.
I've been too frightened to go out.
(Cork pops)
- So they found you in Oldbury Woods.
Well, to be quite honest with you, I didn't know where in the world I was.
He kept me blindfolded and tied up most of the time.
I remember scratching away at the rope, you know, trying to loosen it but of course it was no use.
In the end, I realised that I just had to keep him talking.
Thank God that's all he wanted, eh?
Well, here's to freedom.
Bet you didn't think I'd make it.
Wouldn't put anything past you, Amber.
All's well that ends well, eh?
Fraternising with the enemy?
She looks very good for someone who's been locked up all week.
Tell you what, H, if I ever get kidnapped,
I hope they stash me somewhere near Oldbury Health Farm.
In fact, I might give them a ring, see if they've got a room for tonight.
I need to get my chakras energised.
- Well, you know what energises her.
And I know what energises his football.
(Laughter)
- Ah!
Here comes the prodigal son.
Roger.
- Kyle!
Remember this place, do you?
This is commonly known as the players' lounge.
P-L-A-Y-E-R, player.
That's you.
Time's not on your side, son, so you'd better speed up the recovery or you'll be needing a guest pass
- Lucky I've got my physio, then.
Yeah, how's he getting on, Elaine?
- Yeah, all right.
All right?
Just all right?
We're not paying you to watch daytime TV and get your back rubbed, so pull your finger out.
Are you trying to ruin my career?
He doesn't need an excuse to kick me out.
He wants you back and you'd be back a hell of a lot quicker if you concentrate on training, not gambling.
I was gonna take you out for dinner but you know what?
I lost my appetite.
Hey!
Well done.
You looked part of the team today.
Cheers.
I were made up when it went in.
It's boss when you score at home.
Mr Webb, don't you reckon he deserves a bevy later to celebrate?
We've been ever so good.
We've haven't touched a drop.
That's why he scored today, love.
So stay good cos it's obviously working.
(Phone)
(Laboured breathing)
(Answering machine bleeps) - 'Hi, this is the Lasletts.
'Sorry we can't take your call, please leave a message and we'll call you back.'
(Beeps) - (Tanya) 'Hi, darling.
'The boys will be celebrating so Hazel's arranged a girls' night out.'
I imagine it'll be a late one so I'll stay over at hers.
I've got my mobile with me.
'I imagine you probably could do with a good night's sleep anyway.'
OK.
Bye.
Kyle!
Wait!
Why, so you can stab me in the back again?
(Shutters clicking)
- Can't you think of anyone but yourself?
Go on, mate, take this.
- Cheers.
Roger's my boss and as far as he knows, I'm just your physio.
So sorry I'm not singing your praises and telling him you're great in bed.
But when we're here, Earls Park's my work and you're my client.
Fine.
- I'm taking you for dinner, so let's go.
This is harder than one of your physio sessions, you know that?
You couldn't do me a massive favour, could you, darling?
Oh, my God.
Can you bring up camera 3?
Can you zoom in on that?
Stop.
That clear enough for you?
Crystal.
He said whatever I've been doing seems to have worked wonders.
There's been no more deterioration.
I could last maybe a year at this rate.
Great!
That's great news.
I understand that you do... eliminations.
Ah!
A curse!
It takes time.
- I don't care what it takes.
I want it done.
(Coughing and gasping)
- Water?
Do you want water?
(Choking)
Here's the kickoff
The winner of today's game will move on to the state championship 1 week from today
Play your game, buddy.
A victory today will send the crows to the state championship.
So, are you the guy?
I guess that depends on what you're looking for.
Mikhail Mxyzl...
Mxyzptlk.
Let me guess, you want to buy a vowel.
No, I just wanted to put 80 on the game.
You mean the game that started already.
Sorry I can't take a bet after the kickoff.
Rookie, huh?
Well, maybe in your case, I'll make an exception.
Thanks.
Can you put me down for Smallville to win?
You sure about that?
I have a funny feeling about the quarterback today.
Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I never bet against Clark Kent.
Suit yourself.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Rule #1
- A bet is a bet.
Alright guys here we go.
Ready?
Blue 32, Blue 32...
HUT!
Trip.
Touchdown!
Crows win the game!
Unbelievable!
Is he okay?
His collarbone's broken in 2 places.
I can't figure out how you could pommel a guy that outweighs you by 100 pounds, and shatter his collarbone.
I'm sorry.
Must have been an accident, I mean, I got a surge of adrenaline.
Adrenaline doesn't explain the fact that you went from chucking balls of hay to chucking 60-yard passes overnight.
I guess I'm a fast learner, you said yourself I was a natural.
A natural who adamantly refuses to get a doctor after he collapsed 2 weeks ago.
What are you trying to say?
Coach Quigley thinks you're on some kind of performance-enhancing drug.
Like steroids?
What do you think?
I put myself on the line and said there's no way Clark Kent would do that.
I'm not on drugs.
I hope not.
Because if it comes out you're not on the same playing field as these guys, it's gonna be pretty disappointing to forfeit an entire championship season.
And a college career.
I can't imagine what it must have been like to grow up in a war-torn country.
Obviously.
This is as far you can get from scavenging the street, but,
Growing up 'hand-to-mouth' does tend to make you resourceful.
Resourceful enough to get the attention of my father's LuthorCorp foreign scholarship.
So how do you like Smallville high
I think it is the perfect place for me to make my American dream.
There are many opportunities, and the girls are... pretty.
I hope the classes aren't too difficult for you.
I reviewed your application;
I must say I was surprised by your poor test scores and grades.
Look Mikhail, I'm just curious why my father would award a scholarship, historically earmarked for future Nobel- prize-winners to a perennial 'C' student.
You want to send me back.
No.
I'd just like to know what you're really doing here.
What potential did my father see in you, Mikhail?
Cut.
Potential you do not see on a report card, Mr. Luthor.
Hey!
I didn't realize bookies made house calls, especially after-hours.
Well, I guess I just walked into the Lion's mouth, eh?
What are you talking about?
You're a first timer, and you show up at the end of the season, I asked some questions.
I don't think it is coincidence that you are Smallville's most notorious whistle-blower.
Notorious, huh?
I like the sound of that.
This bet was just research for the article?
- Front page if you play your cards right.
I don't suppose that being a local celebrity will be good for business.
I think maybe you should change professions.
You just found my Achille's Heel.
- What, greed?
- No, pretty girls with infectious smiles.
I'm still writing the article.
If you don't even know when to place a bet, I don't think you have the inside scoop you're looking for.
Promise not to mention my name, and I'll let you 'shadow' me, I'll be your personal escort through the seedier parts of Smallville.
If I cut you a break, I expect a full behind-the-scenes story.
Of course, and the first stop is the Winner's Circle.
So, what are you going to do with the money?
- Textbooks
- Ooh, don't go too crazy, huh?
My dad's on unemployment, so my college fund took a massive hit this year.
How would you like to make enough money to pay an entire semester of tuition before you wake up tomorrow morning?
I have to go to the Shark's game in Metropolis tonight.
Sharks... 8-to-1.
Chloe, if you want the big article you have to get inside the mind of a gambler.
You have to be ready to raise the stakes.
That is, if you aren't scared.
Count me in.
There's more to life than championships, Clark.
I bet it's easy to say that when you have one.
Dad, when I put on that uniform, it's like I forget who I am, but at the same time, I've never known myself better.
It's more than just a game.
Clark, I allowed you join the football team because I though you understood your responsibility not to let anybody get hurt out there.
And I accepted that responsibility because I know I can control my abilities.
Then explain to me why there's a kid lying in a hospital bed right now?
Have you ever seen me trip...
Ever?
Something happened out on that field, it's like I couldn't control my own legs!
Just because you are strong, doesn't mean you can't get rattled out there like anybody else.
I'm sorry but the last place you should be is on that football field and you know it.
Coach Quigley's at the party tonight.
I'll call him and be the bad guy.
No, Dad.
Like you said, It's my responsibility.
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
What's up?
Kent, you saved the day!
What a play!
You put us in the championship!
No, the team put us in the championship.
- I can see the ring on my finger already.
- I can see the scholarships lined up.
Clark, you're here!
Coach, coach, coach!
Topeka West may have 3 titles under it's belt, but I know we have a real shot at the championship, and this year we have it all.
An inpenetrable defense, an aggressive offense...
And a GOLDEN ARM!
Let's go take the title home!
Coach, coach, coach!
I like the new textbooks!
Hi!
Don't worry, I just took 10 percent off the top for fun, the rest of my winnings are tucked safely away for college tuition.
I'm glad that my tip paid off for you.
Are you kidding me?
That game was awesome!
I haven't had that much fun on a couch since Johnny Rosenblatt in 5th grade!
I mean, all of those painted 'beer-bellies' and foam hands suddenly make sense when you have something riding on the game!
See, why would want to spoil all the fun by writing that article?
Because it just keeps getting juicier by the minute.
Are you sure about that?
Why, are you going to do something to change my mind?
Nice try, you're very cute.
But I already gave you anonymity, and it's going to press tonight.
- But you're only starting to scratch the surface, and I can give you so much more 'dirt'.
You're just trying to stall the article, aren't you?
I don't think you understand me, Chloe.
I always get what I want.
On looks, apparently, because your charm just ran out.
Stop.
Kiss me.
This is me asking you nicely.
Now you're going to drop that article, whether you want to or not.
I've never seen you miss before.
I've also never seen you shrink from responsibility, no matter how difficult.
You saw the look on those guys' faces, I couldn't let them down.
I just thought I could find a way to play like everyone else.
Clark.
Open your hand.
What are you doing?
You know how dangerous Kryptonite is!
I always get better after it's gone.
So what if I'm playing sick?
Other guys play injured.
And if Dad know I don't have my abilities and can't hurt anyone.
You are not taking meteor rocks on that field, I know it's hard, you can't make yourself sick!
And I can't quit either!
Clark, the answer is no.
You asked your father if we'd ever seen you trip before...
Never.
Not without Kryptonite.
I was so excited to see you get a chance to be like everyone else, that
I guess I forgot for a moment that you aren't.
I didn't think anything of it when you tripped, but you've never had mishaps like other kids.
Something happened to you out there.
And if you really want to play in the game on Saturday, you need to find out what it was.
It's alright Clark, you can stay.
I thought you had some self-imposed restraining order against me, does this mean you're talking to me again?
No it just means I'm taking a chance on getting your Dr. Jekyll side today.
What's up with the self-logging?
I watching the sports editor's tape of the game,
Trying to figure out what happened, but...
It's like I had no control, like my mind was sending one message, but my..
but your body was getting another.
Yeah.
It's Mikhail.
The foreign exchange kid?
- Mixa...
- Mxyzptlk.
Say that 3 times fast.
He's our new resident 'Puppet Master'.
This is kind of embarrassing, but... he made me kiss him.
Made you?
Yeah, it was just like how you explained your trip, it was like someone else was controlling me.
Yeah but, why would he want me to lose the game?
Clark, he's the biggest bookie in the school!
The power to control the odds.
Let me do a search on his name.
'0 Matches Found'
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Mxyzptlk didn't bring anything up.
Well what's that?
'Did you mean KLTPZYXM?
' It's Mikhail's name backwards.
- Looks like a nursery rhyme gone bad.
- Yeah, it's some legend from the Piatori region in the Balkans.
That's near where Mikhail's from.
It says the region's been terrorized for centuries by a bloodline of people, who can control the hand of luck.
It's not exactly luck if they're controlling people.
What does it say about the backwards name?
- The family changed their name a century ago and fled the area to escape the stigma after a village burned to the ground.
Looks like Mikhail's still running from his heritage.
It doesn't exactly say how to stop the kissing bandit, does it?
Oh, here!
According to the legends, the only thing that stopped them was a plague of locusts.
There may be one other force they didn't count on.
Think about it, who brought him here in the first place?
You want me to deport a LuthorCorp foreign exchange student?
Gambling on Crows games, isn't a sanctioned extracurricular activity.
I'm surprised you care so much about some half-rate bookie.
Or is there something else about Mikhail you aren't telling me?
Lex, you sponsored him, I just thought you might want to do something about it.
Of course I'll look into it.
I'm surprised you didn't go to the principal first, or Coach Teague.
But I see how that can be more complicated than it sounds.
Why would it be more complicated?
Come on.
I can't be the only one who's picked on Lana's fondness for quarterbacks.
Even retired ones.
Yeah, to be honest, it has been hard to see her with someone else.
Don't worry, Paris can have a magical effect on people, but... the enchantment has a funny way of waning the longer you're gone.
I know Lana.
She's never been this serious about anyone.
You sound awfully concerned about that for someone that let her walk out of his life.
I guess the whole 'If you love them, set them free' thing kind of backfired.
It's not about love, Clark.
It's about what you're willing to do for it.
On that field, you'll do whatever it takes to win.
But if you're not willing to do the same for Lana... maybe she doesn't mean as much to you as you think.
Clark on steroids.
It's a little hard to picture.
It happens to a lot of guys.
Want so badly to outperform everyone, before you know it, all they care about is winning, no matter what the cost.
You're not responsible for Clark.
Actually I am.
Coach Quigley asked me to give him a drug test, and I never mentioned it to Clark, so I lied and said it came back clean.
Why would you do that?
I don't know, cause I believe in Clark!
And because he knows about us.
I didn't want to stir the waters.
If he wanted to get back at me, all he has to do is tell somebody at the school, and I lose my job.
- Clark wouldn't make it personal.
- Why not?
I can't imagine what I'd do if someone tried to take you away from me.
Nobody took me away from Clark, I left.
Right.
Clark's a big part of the reason why I took off for Paris in the first place.
Oh, that must be from the book of things you never want to hear about your girlfriend's Ex.
Look Jason, I'm with you now and I couldn't be happier.
And I know,
Clark can be unpredictable, but he knows that you need this job to stay in college.
I know it's hard because you've been so close to him...
But are you sure you really know him?
Don't get me wrong, Mikhail.
I appreciate your entrepreneurial ingenuity, but importing Bookies tends to reflect poorly on a company.
These are just fun games.
The I.N.S. isn't exactly renowned for their good sportsmanship.
They're revoking your student visa and sending you back home.
But a man like you could pull strings to keep me here, yes?
If I wanted to.
But whatever talents my father saw in you, they're not worth the embarrassment you bring to me and my company.
I've made the arrangements, you'll be halfway across the Atlantic by morning.
You don't really want that.
You want to know why your Dad brought me here.
Not that badly.
What if we make a wager?
Now why would I take a bet when I can just have you thrown out of here?
Because I know gamblers better than anybody.
You're the caviar kind -
See when you hold everything in your hand, the only thing that can give you a thrill, is putting your chips on the one thing that can slip through your fingers.
And what would that one thing be, Mikhail?
Well in this case...
Me.
How much do you believe in this quarterback friend of yours, Clark Kent?
The Championship Game?
What's the wager?
If the Crows lose, you get Citizenship for me, and $1 million dollars to start again.
And if the Crows win,
I have a hard time believing you can cover that bet.
I can't.
But the reason your father brought me here is far more valuable than just money.
Oh look.
A real, live, American football superhero.
What are you doing here?
I came here to thank you for ratting me out to Lex.
It wasn't hard to figure out, I knew Chloe would squeal, just not to him.
She's too proud.
You seemed to be the common denominator, so you forget, games are my business, so if you don't know the players, you cannot guess the outcome.
I thought you'd be halfway back to the 'village of the damned' by now.
I'm not cursed, Clark.
I am lucky.
And on Saturday, the championship game, I'm going to be very lucky.
If you think I'm going to lose that game for you...
If... when there is an if, there are odds, and I always beat the odds.
Choke.
For example, the odds in the championship are based on you playing.
If you don't go out on the field, then my profit margin takes an unfortunate turn.
That is why you're not going to tell anyone else about me, and you're going to be on that field.
Unless, you want to see more of your buddies in the hospital.
Breathe.
- Chloe.
- Hey!
Clark, warm-up in 15 minutes.
I sure hope you had better luck with the locusts than I did with Lex.
They aren't selling biblical plagues on 'Amazon. com', but since every legend is born in truth, I did look up our favorite apocalyptic critters.
Besides eating crops in a single bound, what else can they do?
When locusts swarm, they emit an energy wave to avoid crashing into each other.
Maybe Mikhail's commands operate on a similar frequency, like a radio signal.
Or a dog whistle, the sound travels but the human ear doesn't pick it up.
Yeah.
What's interesting is once a locust's signal is jammed, they can't fly anymore without running into each other.
It's permanent.
Maybe all we have to do is find something that will jam Mikhail's frequency for good.
And I think I know where to find that, so now we just have to find him.
Knowing his quest for the American Dream, he's got a lot of bets riding on this game,
He'll be here.
- O.K.
- I gotta go.
- Good Luck.
- Thanks.
Greetings Football fans, and welcome to the Championship game between the
Topeka Valley Huskies, and your Smallville Crows!
Clark.
What are you doing?
You know what Mikhail said.
He'd hurt those guys if I wasn't out there.
250 pound guys banging into each other on a football field is one thing, but getting hit by you is like getting hit by a train, it's a big difference, son.
I hope that doesn't happen.
I think Chloe and I found a way to stop Mikhail.
Oh Chloe and You think you found a way to stop.
Well I'm sorry son, thinking is not good enough.
- Dad I know you don't agree with me, but sometimes taking responsibility means having faith in yourself to make the hard choices.
- It also means accepting the consequences.
Every handshake, every hug, every time I'm out on that field I make the conscious decision to fall when those guys hit me so they don't get hurt.
No matter how hard you try, you can't understand that.
That's why it's my decision, not yours.
You're starting to sound more and more like your father.
I hope so, Dad.
Trip.
Alright, let's go, let's go, come on!
Fumble.
I knew it was you Chloe!
Stop.
Looks like someone's been broken.
Sucks when you have to play fair doesn't it?
In my country, you don't survive if you can't adapt to the unexpected.
1st down, the Huskies call their last time-out!
Clark.
What are you doing here?
Here's how the last play in my game goes.
The Crows score another touchdown, Chloe's dead.
If you don't go on the field right now, and lose the game...
Chloe's dead.
Kent.
Let's go.
We need an 'Ace-back Montana Post'.
This is it.
It's for the title.
Crows have it 1st and 10 on the 50-yard line.
5 seconds remaining on the clock.
Smallville has one more play.
Blue, 32!
Hut!
Touchdown!
The Crows win!
Clark Kent makes another unbelievable play!
Come on, man!
We're missing the party!
Looks like championship quarterbacks no longer have a curfew, huh?
I'm late...
Sorry.
Clark.
Your mother and I know that Mikhail was arrested.
Now, when I was out on that same field, all I had to worry about was completing the next pass, or whether or not I was going to get tackled.
We're very proud of you.
For everything.
- Hey you, come on.
Night.
- Good night.
I don't know what it is with you, but no matter how many times I put you in the penalty box, it never sticks.
I hear you're quite the hero tonight, Clark Kent.
Yeah well, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have won the game.
Yeah well, you can thank Uncle Sam for that.
My Uncle Sam.
It's amazing the access a 3-star-General has to cool toys.
And you never know when a jamming device for Stealth Fighters will come in handy in a football game!
Because of that jamming device, Mikhail can't control anyone anymore.
Awesome.
But what I don't understand is how I miraculously came untied.
And what I don't understand is how you got sucked into anything besides anonymous tips.
Well, we all have our weaknesses, I guess.
Except for you, of course.
I think you'll find your new accommodations a lot more comfortable than county lock-up.
And where are you taking me?
Don't worry.
You're going to have a lot of company.
I'm not worried, I have the feeling I can learn a lot from you, but
I'm just sorry we can't make good on our agreement.
You underestimate the value of my winnings.
I told you Mr. Luthor, I've lost my talent.
Mikhail, if there's one thing I've learned is that anything lost, can be found again.
If you knew I had a special talent, then why did you bet against me?
I didn't.
I bet on Clark Kent.
Like I said...
You're not alone.
Lana.
Where's Jason?
I've been looking for him, I actually left him 3 messages.
Yeah I know.
I thought he'd want to know that Metropolis University offered me a scholarship.
That's great Clark.
One of the scouts he called saw me in the game.
I wanted to thank him for trusting me.
Well it's too bad that you couldn't return the favor.
Jason was fired this morning.
It's good to know the local football star still has time for his friends.
I wouldn't put it like that.
Wild guess.
You're not talking about the 'football star' part.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
But what you and I talk about is supposed to stay between us.
I see.
So today I'm taking the role of the despicable untrustworthy friend, and as usual our hero is making the fatal flaw of jumping to conclusions.
You're going to tell me you weren't the one who got Jason fired?
A teacher-student liason is a taboo that's pretty hard to come back from.
Oh, you're going to take the moral high ground on this?
Clark, I'd hate to see Lana's infatuation earn her a 'Scarlet Letter' around town.
Well she has you to thank for that!
Cause you and I were the only two who knew about it, now everybody's talking.
You didn't do this to protect her.
You know Lana isn't meant to be with Jason.
Maybe a year ago, I would've believed that you got him fired out of some twisted loyalty for being my friend.
But you didn't do this for me.
Why did you do it?
Here's the kickoff
The winner of today's game will move on to the state championship 1 week from today
Play your game, buddy.
A victory today will send the crows to the state championship.
So, are you the guy?

What are you talking about?
You're a first timer, and you show up at the end of the season, I asked some questions.
I don't think it is coincidence that you are Smallville's most notorious whistle-blower.
Notorious, huh?
I like the sound of that.
This bet was just research for the article?
-
- Front page if you play your cards right.
I don't suppose that being a local celebrity will be good for business.
I think maybe you should change professions.
You just found my Achille's Heel.
-
- What, greed?
-
- No, pretty girls with infectious smiles.
I'm still writing the article.
If you don't even know when to place a bet, I don't think you have the inside scoop you're looking for.
Promise not to mention my name, and I'll let you 'shadow' me, I'll be your personal escort through the seedier parts of Smallville.
If I cut you a break, I expect a full behind-the-scenes story.
Of course, and the first stop is the Winner's Circle.
So, what are you going to do with the money?
-
- Textbooks -
- Ooh, don't go too crazy, huh?
My dad's on unemployment, so my college fund took a massive hit this year.
How would you like to make enough money to pay an entire semester of tuition before you wake up tomorrow morning?
I have to go to the Shark's game in Metropolis tonight.
Sharks... 8-to-1.
Chloe, if you want the big article you have to get inside the mind of a gambler.
You have to be ready to raise the stakes.
That is, if you aren't scared.
Count me in.
There's more to life than championships, Clark.
I bet it's easy to say that when you have one.
Dad, when I put on that uniform, it's like I forget who I am, but at the same time, I've never known myself better.
It's more than just a game.
Clark, I allowed you join the football team because I though you understood your responsibility not to let anybody get hurt out there.
And I accepted that responsibility because I know I can control my abilities.
Then explain to me why there's a kid lying in a hospital bed right now?
Have you ever seen me trip...
Ever?
Something happened out on that field, it's like I couldn't control my own legs!
Just because you are strong, doesn't mean you can't get rattled out there like anybody else.
I'm sorry but the last place you should be is on that football field and you know it.
Coach Quigley's at the party tonight.
I'll call him and be the bad guy.
No, Dad.
Like you said, It's my responsibility.
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
What's up?
Kent, you saved the day!
What a play!
You put us in the championship!
No, the team put us in the championship.
-
- I can see the ring on my finger already.
-
- I can see the scholarships lined up.
Clark, you're here!
Coach, coach, coach!
Topeka West may have 3 titles under it's belt, but I know we have a real shot at the championship, and this year we have it all.
An inpenetrable defense, an aggressive offense...
And a GOLDEN ARM!
Let's go take the title home!
Coach, coach, coach!
I like the new textbooks!
Hi!
Don't worry, I just took 10 percent off the top for fun, the rest of my winnings are tucked safely away for college tuition.
I'm glad that my tip paid off for you.
Are you kidding me?
That game was awesome!
I haven't had that much fun on a couch since Johnny Rosenblatt in 5th grade!
I mean, all of those painted 'beer-bellies' and foam hands suddenly make sense when you have something riding on the game!
See, why would want to spoil all the fun by writing that article?
Because it just keeps getting juicier by the minute.
Are you sure about that?
Why, are you going to do something to change my mind?
Nice try, you're very cute.
But I already gave you anonymity, and it's going to press tonight.
-
- But you're only starting to scratch the surface, and I can give you so much more 'dirt'.
You're just trying to stall the article, aren't you?
I don't think you understand me, Chloe.
I always get what I want.
On looks, apparently, because your charm just ran out.
Stop.
Kiss me.
This is me asking you nicely.
Now you're going to drop that article, whether you want to or not.
I've never seen you miss before.
I've also never seen you shrink from responsibility, no matter how difficult.
You saw the look on those guys' faces, I couldn't let them down.
I just thought I could find a way to play like everyone else.
Clark.
Open your hand.
What are you doing?
You know how dangerous Kryptonite is!
I always get better after it's gone.
So what if I'm playing sick?
Other guys play injured.
And if Dad know I don't have my abilities and can't hurt anyone.
You are not taking meteor rocks on that field, I know it's hard, you can't make yourself sick!
And I can't quit either!
Clark, the answer is no.
You asked your father if we'd ever seen you trip before...
Never.
Not without Kryptonite.
I was so excited to see you get a chance to be like everyone else, that
I guess I forgot for a moment that you aren't.
I didn't think anything of it when you tripped, but you've never had mishaps like other kids.
Something happened to you out there.
And if you really want to play in the game on Saturday, you need to find out what it was.
It's alright Clark, you can stay.
I thought you had some self-imposed restraining order against me, does this mean you're talking to me again?
No it just means I'm taking a chance on getting your Dr. Jekyll side today.
What's up with the self-logging?
I watching the sports editor's tape of the game,
Trying to figure out what happened, but...
It's like I had no control, like my mind was sending one message, but my..
but your body was getting another.
Yeah.
It's Mikhail.
The foreign exchange kid?
-
- Mixa...
-
- Mxyzptlk.
Say that 3 times fast.
He's our new resident 'Puppet Master'.
This is kind of embarrassing, but... he made me kiss him.
Made you?
Yeah, it was just like how you explained your trip, it was like someone else was controlling me.
Yeah but, why would he want me to lose the game?
Clark, he's the biggest bookie in the school!
The power to control the odds.
Let me do a search on his name.
'0 Matches Found'
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Mxyzptlk didn't bring anything up.
Well what's that?
'Did you mean KLTPZYXM?
' It's Mikhail's name backwards.
-
- Looks like a nursery rhyme gone bad.
-
- Yeah, it's some legend from the Piatori region in the Balkans.
That's near where Mikhail's from.
It says the region's been terrorized for centuries by a bloodline of people, who can control the hand of luck.
It's not exactly luck if they're controlling people.
What does it say about the backwards name?
-
- The family changed their name a century ago and fled the area to escape the stigma after a village burned to the ground.
Looks like Mikhail's still running from his heritage.
It doesn't exactly say how to stop the kissing bandit, does it?
Oh, here!
According to the legends, the only thing that stopped them was a plague of locusts.
There may be one other force they didn't count on.
Think about it, who brought him here in the first place?
You want me to deport a LuthorCorp foreign exchange student?
Gambling on Crows games, isn't a sanctioned extracurricular activity.
I'm surprised you care so much about some half-rate bookie.
Or is there something else about Mikhail you aren't telling me?
Lex, you sponsored him, I just thought you might want to do something about it.
Of course I'll look into it.
I'm surprised you didn't go to the principal first, or Coach Teague.
But I see how that can be more complicated than it sounds.
Why would it be more complicated?
Come on.
I can't be the only one who's picked on Lana's fondness for quarterbacks.
Even retired ones.
Yeah, to be honest, it has been hard to see her with someone else.
Don't worry, Paris can have a magical effect on people, but... the enchantment has a funny way of waning the longer you're gone.
I know Lana.
She's never been this serious about anyone.
You sound awfully concerned about that for someone that let her walk out of his life.
I guess the whole 'If you love them, set them free' thing kind of backfired.
It's not about love, Clark.
It's about what you're willing to do for it.
On that field, you'll do whatever it takes to win.
But if you're not willing to do the same for Lana... maybe she doesn't mean as much to you as you think.
Clark on steroids.
It's a little hard to picture.
It happens to a lot of guys.
Want so badly to outperform everyone, before you know it, all they care about is winning, no matter what the cost.
You're not responsible for Clark.
Actually I am.
Coach Quigley asked me to give him a drug test, and I never mentioned it to Clark, so I lied and said it came back clean.
Why would you do that?
I don't know, cause I believe in Clark!
And because he knows about us.
I didn't want to stir the waters.
If he wanted to get back at me, all he has to do is tell somebody at the school, and I lose my job.
-
- Clark wouldn't make it personal.
-
- Why not?
I can't imagine what I'd do if someone tried to take you away from me.
Nobody took me away from Clark, I left.
Right.
Clark's a big part of the reason why I took off for Paris in the first place.
Oh, that must be from the book of things you never want to hear about your girlfriend's Ex.
Look Jason, I'm with you now and I couldn't be happier.
And I know,
Clark can be unpredictable, but he knows that you need this job to stay in college.
I know it's hard because you've been so close to him...
But are you sure you really know him?
Don't get me wrong, Mikhail.
I appreciate your entrepreneurial ingenuity, but importing Bookies tends to reflect poorly on a company.
These are just fun games.
The I.N.S. isn't exactly renowned for their good sportsmanship.
They're revoking your student visa and sending you back home.
But a man like you could pull strings to keep me here, yes?
If I wanted to.
But whatever talents my father saw in you, they're not worth the embarrassment you bring to me and my company.
I've made the arrangements, you'll be halfway across the Atlantic by morning.
You don't really want that.
You want to know why your Dad brought me here.
Not that badly.
What if we make a wager?
Now why would I take a bet when I can just have you thrown out of here?
Because I know gamblers better than anybody.
You're the caviar kind --
See when you hold everything in your hand, the only thing that can give you a thrill, is putting your chips on the one thing that can slip through your fingers.
And what would that one thing be, Mikhail?
Well in this case...
Me.
How much do you believe in this quarterback friend of yours, Clark Kent?
The Championship Game?
What's the wager?
If the Crows lose, you get Citizenship for me, and $1 million dollars to start again.
And if the Crows win,
I have a hard time believing you can cover that bet.
I can't.
But the reason your father brought me here is far more valuable than just money.
Oh look.
A real, live, American football superhero.
What are you doing here?
I came here to thank you for ratting me out to Lex.
It wasn't hard to figure out, I knew Chloe would squeal, just not to him.
She's too proud.
You seemed to be the common denominator, so you forget, games are my business, so if you don't know the players, you cannot guess the outcome.
I thought you'd be halfway back to the 'village of the damned' by now.
I'm not cursed, Clark.
I am lucky.
And on Saturday, the championship game, I'm going to be very lucky.
If you think I'm going to lose that game for you...
If... when there is an if, there are odds, and I always beat the odds.
Choke.
For example, the odds in the championship are based on you playing.
If you don't go out on the field, then my profit margin takes an unfortunate turn.
That is why you're not going to tell anyone else about me, and you're going to be on that field.
Unless, you want to see more of your buddies in the hospital.
Breathe.
-
- Chloe.
-
- Hey!
Clark, warm-up in 15 minutes.
I sure hope you had better luck with the locusts than I did with Lex. is born in truth, I did look up our favorite apocalyptic critters.
Besides eating crops in a single bound, what else can they do?
When locusts swarm, they emit an energy wave to avoid crashing into each other.
Maybe Mikhail's commands operate on a similar frequency, like a radio signal.
Or a dog whistle, the sound travels but the human ear doesn't pick it up.
Yeah.
What's interesting is once a locust's signal is jammed, they can't fly anymore without running into each other.
It's permanent.
Maybe all we have to do is find something that will jam Mikhail's frequency for good.
And I think I know where to find that, so now we just have to find him.
Knowing his quest for the American Dream, he's got a lot of bets riding on this game,
He'll be here.
-
- O.K. -
- I gotta go.
-
- Good Luck.
-
- Thanks.
Greetings Football fans, and welcome to the Championship game between the
Topeka Valley Huskies, and your Smallville Crows!
Clark.
What are you doing?
You know what Mikhail said.
He'd hurt those guys if I wasn't out there.
250 pound guys banging into each other on a football field is one thing, but getting hit by you is like getting hit by a train, it's a big difference, son.
I hope that doesn't happen.
I think Chloe and I found a way to stop Mikhail.
Oh Chloe and You think you found a way to stop.
Well I'm sorry son, thinking is not good enough.
-
- Dad I know you don't agree with me, but sometimes taking responsibility means having faith in yourself to make the hard choices.
-
- It also means accepting the consequences.
Every handshake, every hug, every time I'm out on that field I make the conscious decision to fall when those guys hit me so they don't get hurt.
No matter how hard you try, you can't understand that.
That's why it's my decision, not yours.
You're starting to sound more and more like your father.
I hope so, Dad.
Trip.
Alright, let's go, let's go, come on!
Fumble.
I knew it was you Chloe!
Stop.
Looks like someone's been broken.
Sucks when you have to play fair doesn't it?
In my country, you don't survive if you can't adapt to the unexpected.
1st down, the Huskies call their last time-out!
Clark.
What are you doing here?
Here's how the last play in my game goes.
The Crows score another touchdown, Chloe's dead.
If you don't go on the field right now, and lose the game...
Chloe's dead.
Kent.
Let's go.
We need an 'Ace-back Montana Post'.
This is it.
It's for the title.
Crows have it 1st and 10 on the 50-yard line.
5 seconds remaining on the clock.
Smallville has one more play.
Blue, 32!
Hut!
Touchdown!
The Crows win!
Clark Kent makes another unbelievable play!
Come on, man!
We're missing the party!
Looks like championship quarterbacks no longer have a curfew, huh?
I'm late....
Sorry.
Clark.
Your mother and I know that Mikhail was arrested.
Now, when I was out on that same field, all I had to worry about was completing the next pass, or whether or not I was going to get tackled.
We're very proud of you.
For everything.
-
- Hey you, come on.
Night.
-
- Good night.
I don't know what it is with you, but no matter how many times I put you in the penalty box, it never sticks.
I hear you're quite the hero tonight, Clark Kent.
Yeah well, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have won the game.
Yeah well, you can thank Uncle Sam for that.
My Uncle Sam.
It's amazing the access a 3-star-General has to cool toys.
And you never know when a jamming device for Stealth Fighters will come in handy in a football game!
Because of that jamming device, Mikhail can't control anyone anymore.
Awesome.
But what I don't understand is how I miraculously came untied.
And what I don't understand is how you got sucked into anything besides anonymous tips.
Well, we all have our weaknesses, I guess.
Except for you, of course.
I think you'll find your new accommodations a lot more comfortable than county lock-up.
And where are you taking me?
Don't worry.
You're going to have a lot of company.
I'm not worried, I have the feeling I can learn a lot from you, but
I'm just sorry we can't make good on our agreement.
You underestimate the value of my winnings.
I told you Mr. Luthor, I've lost my talent.
Mikhail, if there's one thing I've learned is that anything lost, can be found again.
If you knew I had a special talent, then why did you bet against me?
I didn't.
I bet on Clark Kent.
Like I said...
You're not alone.
Lana.
Where's Jason?
I've been looking for him, I actually left him 3 messages.
Yeah I know.
I thought he'd want to know that Metropolis University offered me a scholarship.
That's great Clark.
One of the scouts he called saw me in the game.
I wanted to thank him for trusting me.
Well it's too bad that you couldn't return the favor.
Jason was fired this morning.
It's good to know the local football star still has time for his friends.
I wouldn't put it like that.
Wild guess.
You're not talking about the 'football star' part.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
But what you and I talk about is supposed to stay between us.
I see.
So today I'm taking the role of the despicable untrustworthy friend, and as usual our hero is making the fatal flaw of jumping to conclusions.
You're going to tell me you weren't the one who got Jason fired?
A teacher-student liason is a taboo that's pretty hard to come back from.
Oh, you're going to take the moral high ground on this?
Clark, I'd hate to see Lana's infatuation earn her a 'Scarlet Letter' around town.
Well she has you to thank for that!
Cause you and I were the only two who knew about it, now everybody's talking.
You didn't do this to protect her.
You know Lana isn't meant to be with Jason.
Maybe a year ago, I would've believed that you got him fired out of some twisted loyalty for being my friend.
But you didn't do this for me.
Why did you do it?
Here's the kickoff
The winner of today's game will move on to the state championship 1 week from today
Play your game, buddy.
A victory today will send the crows to the state championship.
So, are you the guy?
I guess that depends on what you're looking for.
Mikhail Mxyzl...
Mxyzptlk.
Let me guess, you want to buy a vowel.
No, I just wanted to put 80 on the game.
You mean the game that started already.
Sorry I can't take a bet after the kickoff.
Rookie, huh?
Well, maybe in your case, I'll make an exception.
Thanks.
Can you put me down for Smallville to win?
You sure about that?
I have a funny feeling about the quarterback today.
Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I never bet against Clark Kent.
Suit yourself.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Rule #1
- A bet is a bet.
Alright guys here we go.
Ready?
Blue 32, Blue 32...
HUT!
Trip.
Touchdown!
Crows win the game!
Unbelievable!
fdfdfd
Is he okay?
His collarbone's broken in 2 places.
I can't figure out how you could pommel a guy that outweighs you by 100 pounds, and shatter his collarbone.
I'm sorry.
Must have been an accident, I mean, I got a surge of adrenaline.
Adrenaline doesn't explain the fact that you went from chucking balls of hay to chucking 60-yard passes overnight.
I guess I'm a fast learner, you said yourself I was a natural.
A natural who adamantly refuses to get a doctor after he collapsed 2 weeks ago.
What are you trying to say?
Coach Quigley thinks you're on some kind of performance-enhancing drug.
Like steroids?
What do you think?
I put myself on the line and said there's no way Clark Kent would do that.
I'm not on drugs.
I hope not.
Because if it comes out you're not on the same playing field as these guys, it's gonna be pretty disappointing to forfeit an entire championship season.
And a college career.
I can't imagine what it must have been like to grow up in a war-torn country.
Obviously.
This is as far you can get from scavenging the street, but,
Growing up 'hand-to-mouth' does tend to make you resourceful.
Resourceful enough to get the attention of my father's LuthorCorp foreign scholarship.
So how do you like Smallville high
I think it is the perfect place for me to make my American dream.
There are many opportunities, and the girls are... pretty.
I hope the classes aren't too difficult for you.
I reviewed your application;
I must say I was surprised by your poor test scores and grades.
Look Mikhail, I'm just curious why my father would award a scholarship, historically earmarked for future Nobel- prize-winners to a perennial 'C' student.
You want to send me back.
No.
I'd just like to know what you're really doing here.
What potential did my father see in you, Mikhail?
Cut.
Potential you do not see on a report card, Mr. Luthor.
Hey!
I didn't realize bookies made house calls, especially after-hours.
Well, I guess I just walked into the Lion's mouth, eh?
What are you talking about?
You're a first timer, and you show up at the end of the season, I asked some questions.
I don't think it is coincidence that you are Smallville's most notorious whistle-blower.
Notorious, huh?
I like the sound of that.

Gambling on Crows games, isn't a sanctioned extracurricular activity.
I'm surprised you care so much about some half-rate bookie.
Or is there something else about Mikhail you aren't telling me?
Lex, you sponsored him, I just thought you might want to do something about it.
Of course I'll look into it.
I'm surprised you didn't go to the principal first, or Coach Teague.
But I see how that can be more complicated than it sounds.
Why would it be more complicated?
Come on.
I can't be the only one who's picked on Lana's fondness for quarterbacks.
Even retired ones.
Yeah, to be honest, it has been hard to see her with someone else.
Don't worry, Paris can have a magical effect on people, but... the enchantment has a funny way of waning the longer you're gone.
I know Lana.
She's never been this serious about anyone.
You sound awfully concerned about that for someone that let her walk out of his life.
I guess the whole 'If you love them, set them free' thing kind of backfired.
It's not about love, Clark.
It's about what you're willing to do for it.
On that field, you'll do whatever it takes to win.
But if you're not willing to do the same for Lana... maybe she doesn't mean as much to you as you think.
Clark on steroids.
It's a little hard to picture.
It happens to a lot of guys.
Want so badly to outperform everyone, before you know it, all they care about is winning, no matter what the cost.
You're not responsible for Clark.
Actually I am.
Coach Quigley asked me to give him a drug test, and I never mentioned it to Clark, so I lied and said it came back clean.
Why would you do that?
I don't know, cause I believe in Clark!
And because he knows about us.
I didn't want to stir the waters.
If he wanted to get back at me, all he has to do is tell somebody at the school, and I lose my job.
- Clark wouldn't make it personal.
- Why not?
I can't imagine what I'd do if someone tried to take you away from me.
Nobody took me away from Clark, I left.
Right.
Clark's a big part of the reason why I took off for Paris in the first place.
Oh, that must be from the book of things you never want to hear about your girlfriend's Ex.
Look Jason, I'm with you now and I couldn't be happier.
And I know,
Clark can be unpredictable, but he knows that you need this job to stay in college.
I know it's hard because you've been so close to him...
But are you sure you really know him?
Don't get me wrong, Mikhail.
I appreciate your entrepreneurial ingenuity, but importing Bookies tends to reflect poorly on a company.
These are just fun games.
The I.N.S. isn't exactly renowned for their good sportsmanship.
They're revoking your student visa and sending you back home.
But a man like you could pull strings to keep me here, yes?
If I wanted to.
But whatever talents my father saw in you, they're not worth the embarrassment you bring to me and my company.
I've made the arrangements, you'll be halfway across the Atlantic by morning.
You don't really want that.
You want to know why your Dad brought me here.
Not that badly.
What if we make a wager?
Now why would I take a bet when I can just have you thrown out of here?
Because I know gamblers better than anybody.
You're the caviar kind -
See when you hold everything in your hand, the only thing that can give you a thrill, is putting your chips on the one thing that can slip through your fingers.
And what would that one thing be, Mikhail?
Well in this case...
Me.
How much do you believe in this quarterback friend of yours, Clark Kent?
The Championship Game?
What's the wager?
If the Crows lose, you get Citizenship for me, and $1 million dollars to start again.
And if the Crows win,
I have a hard time believing you can cover that bet.
I can't.
But the reason your father brought me here is far more valuable than just money.
Oh look.
A real, live, American football superhero.
What are you doing here?
I came here to thank you for ratting me out to Lex.
It wasn't hard to figure out, I knew Chloe would squeal, just not to him.
She's too proud.
You seemed to be the common denominator, so you forget, games are my business, so if you don't know the players, you cannot guess the outcome.
I thought you'd be halfway back to the 'village of the damned' by now.
I'm not cursed, Clark.
I am lucky.
And on Saturday, the championship game, I'm going to be very lucky.
If you think I'm going to lose that game for you...
If... when there is an if, there are odds, and I always beat the odds.
Choke.
For example, the odds in the championship are based on you playing.
If you don't go out on the field, then my profit margin takes an unfortunate turn.
That is why you're not going to tell anyone else about me, and you're going to be on that field.
Unless, you want to see more of your buddies in the hospital.
Breathe.
- Chloe.
- Hey!
Clark, warm-up in 15 minutes.
I sure hope you had better luck with the locusts than I did with Lex.
They aren't selling biblical plagues on 'Amazon. com', but since every legend is born in truth, I did look up our favorite apocalyptic critters.
Besides eating crops in a single bound, what else can they do?
When locusts swarm, they emit an energy wave to avoid crashing into each other.
Maybe Mikhail's commands operate on a similar frequency, like a radio signal.
Or a dog whistle, the sound travels but the human ear doesn't pick it up.
Yeah.
What's interesting is once a locust's signal is jammed, they can't fly anymore without running into each other.
It's permanent.
Maybe all we have to do is find something that will jam Mikhail's frequency for good.
And I think I know where to find that, so now we just have to find him.
Knowing his quest for the American Dream, he's got a lot of bets riding on this game,
He'll be here.
- O.K.
- I gotta go.
- Good Luck.
- Thanks.
Greetings Football fans, and welcome to the Championship game between the
Topeka Valley Huskies, and your Smallville Crows!
Clark.
What are you doing?
You know what Mikhail said.
He'd hurt those guys if I wasn't out there.
250 pound guys banging into each other on a football field is one thing, but getting hit by you is like getting hit by a train, it's a big difference, son.
I hope that doesn't happen.
I think Chloe and I found a way to stop Mikhail.
Oh Chloe and You think you found a way to stop.
Well I'm sorry son, thinking is not good enough.
- Dad I know you don't agree with me, but sometimes taking responsibility means having faith in yourself to make the hard choices.
- It also means accepting the consequences.
Every handshake, every hug, every time I'm out on that field I make the conscious decision to fall when those guys hit me so they don't get hurt.
No matter how hard you try, you can't understand that.
That's why it's my decision, not yours.
You're starting to sound more and more like your father.
I hope so, Dad.
Trip.
Alright, let's go, let's go, come on!
Fumble.
I knew it was you Chloe!
Stop.
Looks like someone's been broken.
Sucks when you have to play fair doesn't it?
In my country, you don't survive if you can't adapt to the unexpected.
1st down, the Huskies call their last time-out!
Clark.
What are you doing here?
Here's how the last play in my game goes.
The Crows score another touchdown, Chloe's dead.
If you don't go on the field right now, and lose the game...
Chloe's dead.
Kent.
Let's go.
We need an 'Ace-back Montana Post'.
This is it.
It's for the title.
Crows have it 1st and 10 on the 50-yard line.
5 seconds remaining on the clock.
Smallville has one more play.
Blue, 32!
Hut!
Touchdown!
The Crows win!
Clark Kent makes another unbelievable play!
Come on, man!
We're missing the party!
Looks like championship quarterbacks no longer have a curfew, huh?
I'm late...
Sorry.
Clark.
Your mother and I know that Mikhail was arrested.
Now, when I was out on that same field, all I had to worry about was completing the next pass, or whether or not I was going to get tackled.
We're very proud of you.
For everything.
- Hey you, come on.
Night.
- Good night.
I don't know what it is with you, but no matter how many times I put you in the penalty box, it never sticks.
I hear you're quite the hero tonight, Clark Kent.
Yeah well, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have won the game.
Yeah well, you can thank Uncle Sam for that.
My Uncle Sam.
It's amazing the access a 3-star-General has to cool toys.
And you never know when a jamming device for Stealth Fighters will come in handy in a football game!
Because of that jamming device, Mikhail can't control anyone anymore.
Awesome.
But what I don't understand is how I miraculously came untied.
And what I don't understand is how you got sucked into anything besides anonymous tips.
Well, we all have our weaknesses, I guess.
Except for you, of course.
I think you'll find your new accommodations a lot more comfortable than county lock-up.
And where are you taking me?
Don't worry.
You're going to have a lot of company.
I'm not worried, I have the feeling I can learn a lot from you, but
I'm just sorry we can't make good on our agreement.
You underestimate the value of my winnings.
I told you Mr. Luthor, I've lost my talent.
Mikhail, if there's one thing I've learned is that anything lost, can be found again.
If you knew I had a special talent, then why did you bet against me?
I didn't.
I bet on Clark Kent.
Like I said...
You're not alone.
Lana.
Where's Jason?
I've been looking for him, I actually left him 3 messages.
Yeah I know.
I thought he'd want to know that Metropolis University offered me a scholarship.
That's great Clark.
One of the scouts he called saw me in the game.
I wanted to thank him for trusting me.
Well it's too bad that you couldn't return the favor.
Jason was fired this morning.
It's good to know the local football star still has time for his friends.
I wouldn't put it like that.
Wild guess.
You're not talking about the 'football star' part.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
But what you and I talk about is supposed to stay between us.
I see.
So today I'm taking the role of the despicable untrustworthy friend, and as usual our hero is making the fatal flaw of jumping to conclusions.
You're going to tell me you weren't the one who got Jason fired?
A teacher-student liason is a taboo that's pretty hard to come back from.
Oh, you're going to take the moral high ground on this?
Clark, I'd hate to see Lana's infatuation earn her a 'Scarlet Letter' around town.
Well she has you to thank for that!
Cause you and I were the only two who knew about it, now everybody's talking.
You didn't do this to protect her.
You know Lana isn't meant to be with Jason.
Maybe a year ago, I would've believed that you got him fired out of some twisted loyalty for being my friend.
But you didn't do this for me.
Why did you do it?
Here's the kickoff
The winner of today's game will move on to the state championship 1 week from today
Play your game, buddy.
A victory today will send the crows to the state championship.
So, are you the guy?
I guess that depends on what you're looking for.
Mikhail Mxyzl...
Mxyzptlk.
Let me guess, you want to buy a vowel.
No, I just wanted to put 80 on the game.
You mean the game that started already.
Sorry I can't take a bet after the kickoff.
Rookie, huh?
Well, maybe in your case, I'll make an exception.
Thanks.
Can you put me down for Smallville to win?
You sure about that?
I have a funny feeling about the quarterback today.
Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I never bet against Clark Kent.
Suit yourself.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Rule #1
- A bet is a bet.
Alright guys here we go.
Ready?
Blue 32, Blue 32...
HUT!
Trip.
Touchdown!
Crows win the game!
Unbelievable!
fdfdfd
Is he okay?
His collarbone's broken in 2 places.
I can't figure out how you could pommel a guy that outweighs you by 100 pounds, and shatter his collarbone.
I'm sorry.
Must have been an accident, I mean, I got a surge of adrenaline.
Adrenaline doesn't explain the fact that you went from chucking balls of hay to chucking 60-yard passes overnight.
I guess I'm a fast learner, you said yourself I was a natural.
A natural who adamantly refuses to get a doctor after he collapsed 2 weeks ago.
What are you trying to say?
Coach Quigley thinks you're on some kind of performance-enhancing drug.
Like steroids?
What do you think?
I put myself on the line and said there's no way Clark Kent would do that.
I'm not on drugs.
I hope not.
Because if it comes out you're not on the same playing field as these guys, it's gonna be pretty disappointing to forfeit an entire championship season.
And a college career.
I can't imagine what it must have been like to grow up in a war-torn country.
Obviously.
This is as far you can get from scavenging the street, but,
Growing up 'hand-to-mouth' does tend to make you resourceful.
Resourceful enough to get the attention of my father's LuthorCorp foreign scholarship.
So how do you like Smallville high
I think it is the perfect place for me to make my American dream.
There are many opportunities, and the girls are... pretty.
I hope the classes aren't too difficult for you.
I reviewed your application;
I must say I was surprised by your poor test scores and grades.
Look Mikhail, I'm just curious why my father would award a scholarship, historically earmarked for future Nobel- prize-winners to a perennial 'C' student.
You want to send me back.
No.
I'd just like to know what you're really doing here.
What potential did my father see in you, Mikhail?
Cut.
Potential you do not see on a report card, Mr. Luthor.
Hey!
I didn't realize bookies made house calls, especially after-hours.
Well, I guess I just walked into the Lion's mouth, eh?
What are you talking about?
You're a first timer, and you show up at the end of the season, I asked some questions.
I don't think it is coincidence that you are Smallville's most notorious whistle-blower.
Notorious, huh?
I like the sound of that.
This bet was just research for the article?
- Front page if you play your cards right.
I don't suppose that being a local celebrity will be good for business.
I think maybe you should change professions.
You just found my Achille's Heel.
- What, greed?
- No, pretty girls with infectious smiles.
I'm still writing the article.
If you don't even know when to place a bet, I don't think you have the inside scoop you're looking for.
Promise not to mention my name, and I'll let you 'shadow' me, I'll be your personal escort through the seedier parts of Smallville.
If I cut you a break, I expect a full behind-the-scenes story.
Of course, and the first stop is the Winner's Circle.
So, what are you going to do with the money?
- Textbooks
- Ooh, don't go too crazy, huh?
My dad's on unemployment, so my college fund took a massive hit this year.
How would you like to make enough money to pay an entire semester of tuition before you wake up tomorrow morning?
I have to go to the Shark's game in Metropolis tonight.
Sharks... 8-to-1.
Chloe, if you want the big article you have to get inside the mind of a gambler.
You have to be ready to raise the stakes.
That is, if you aren't scared.
Count me in.
There's more to life than championships, Clark.
I bet it's easy to say that when you have one.
Dad, when I put on that uniform, it's like I forget who I am, but at the same time, I've never known myself better.
It's more than just a game.
Clark, I allowed you join the football team because I though you understood your responsibility not to let anybody get hurt out there.
And I accepted that responsibility because I know I can control my abilities.
Then explain to me why there's a kid lying in a hospital bed right now?
Have you ever seen me trip...
Ever?
Something happened out on that field, it's like I couldn't control my own legs!
Just because you are strong, doesn't mean you can't get rattled out there like anybody else.
I'm sorry but the last place you should be is on that football field and you know it.
Coach Quigley's at the party tonight.
I'll call him and be the bad guy.
No, Dad.
Like you said, It's my responsibility.
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
What's up?
Kent, you saved the day!
What a play!
You put us in the championship!
No, the team put us in the championship.
- I can see the ring on my finger already.
- I can see the scholarships lined up.
Clark, you're here!
Coach, coach, coach!
Topeka West may have 3 titles under it's belt, but I know we have a real shot at the championship, and this year we have it all.
An inpenetrable defense, an aggressive offense...
And a GOLDEN ARM!
Let's go take the title home!
Coach, coach, coach!
I like the new textbooks!
Hi!
Don't worry, I just took 10 percent off the top for fun, the rest of my winnings are tucked safely away for college tuition.
I'm glad that my tip paid off for you.
Are you kidding me?
That game was awesome!
I haven't had that much fun on a couch since Johnny Rosenblatt in 5th grade!
I mean, all of those painted 'beer-bellies' and foam hands suddenly make sense when you have something riding on the game!
See, why would want to spoil all the fun by writing that article?
Because it just keeps getting juicier by the minute.
Are you sure about that?
Why, are you going to do something to change my mind?
Nice try, you're very cute.
But I already gave you anonymity, and it's going to press tonight.
- But you're only starting to scratch the surface, and I can give you so much more 'dirt'.
You're just trying to stall the article, aren't you?
I don't think you understand me, Chloe.
I always get what I want.
On looks, apparently, because your charm just ran out.
Stop.
Kiss me.
This is me asking you nicely.
Now you're going to drop that article, whether you want to or not.
I've never seen you miss before.
I've also never seen you shrink from responsibility, no matter how difficult.
You saw the look on those guys' faces, I couldn't let them down.
I just thought I could find a way to play like everyone else.
Clark.
Open your hand.
What are you doing?
You know how dangerous Kryptonite is!
I always get better after it's gone.
So what if I'm playing sick?
Other guys play injured.
And if Dad know I don't have my abilities and can't hurt anyone.
You are not taking meteor rocks on that field, I know it's hard, you can't make yourself sick!
And I can't quit either!
Clark, the answer is no.
You asked your father if we'd ever seen you trip before...
Never.
Not without Kryptonite.
I was so excited to see you get a chance to be like everyone else, that
I guess I forgot for a moment that you aren't.
I didn't think anything of it when you tripped, but you've never had mishaps like other kids.
Something happened to you out there.
And if you really want to play in the game on Saturday, you need to find out what it was.
It's alright Clark, you can stay.
I thought you had some self-imposed restraining order against me, does this mean you're talking to me again?
No it just means I'm taking a chance on getting your Dr. Jekyll side today.
What's up with the self-logging?
I watching the sports editor's tape of the game,
Trying to figure out what happened, but...
It's like I had no control, like my mind was sending one message, but my..
but your body was getting another.
Yeah.
It's Mikhail.
The foreign exchange kid?
- Mixa...
- Mxyzptlk.
Say that 3 times fast.
He's our new resident 'Puppet Master'.
This is kind of embarrassing, but... he made me kiss him.
Made you?
Yeah, it was just like how you explained your trip, it was like someone else was controlling me.
Yeah but, why would he want me to lose the game?
Clark, he's the biggest bookie in the school!
The power to control the odds.
Let me do a search on his name.
'0 Matches Found'
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Mxyzptlk didn't bring anything up.
Well what's that?
'Did you mean KLTPZYXM?
' It's Mikhail's name backwards.
- Looks like a nursery rhyme gone bad.
- Yeah, it's some legend from the Piatori region in the Balkans.
That's near where Mikhail's from.
It says the region's been terrorized for centuries by a bloodline of people, who can control the hand of luck.
It's not exactly luck if they're controlling people.
What does it say about the backwards name?
- The family changed their name a century ago and fled the area to escape the stigma after a village burned to the ground.
Looks like Mikhail's still running from his heritage.
It doesn't exactly say how to stop the kissing bandit, does it?
Oh, here!
According to the legends, the only thing that stopped them was a plague of locusts.
There may be one other force they didn't count on.
Think about it, who brought him here in the first place?
You want me to deport a LuthorCorp foreign exchange student?
Gambling on Crows games, isn't a sanctioned extracurricular activity.
I'm surprised you care so much about some half-rate bookie.
Or is there something else about Mikhail you aren't telling me?
Lex, you sponsored him, I just thought you might want to do something about it.
Of course I'll look into it.
I'm surprised you didn't go to the principal first, or Coach Teague.
But I see how that can be more complicated than it sounds.
Why would it be more complicated?
Come on.
I can't be the only one who's picked on Lana's fondness for quarterbacks.
Even retired ones.
Yeah, to be honest, it has been hard to see her with someone else.
Don't worry, Paris can have a magical effect on people, but... the enchantment has a funny way of waning the longer you're gone.
I know Lana.
She's never been this serious about anyone.
You sound awfully concerned about that for someone that let her walk out of his life.
I guess the whole 'If you love them, set them free' thing kind of backfired.
It's not about love, Clark.
It's about what you're willing to do for it.
On that field, you'll do whatever it takes to win.
But if you're not willing to do the same for Lana... maybe she doesn't mean as much to you as you think.
Clark on steroids.
It's a little hard to picture.
It happens to a lot of guys.
Want so badly to outperform everyone, before you know it, all they care about is winning, no matter what the cost.
You're not responsible for Clark.
Actually I am.
Coach Quigley asked me to give him a drug test, and I never mentioned it to Clark, so I lied and said it came back clean.
Why would you do that?
I don't know, cause I believe in Clark!
And because he knows about us.
I didn't want to stir the waters.
If he wanted to get back at me, all he has to do is tell somebody at the school, and I lose my job.
- Clark wouldn't make it personal.
- Why not?
I can't imagine what I'd do if someone tried to take you away from me.
Nobody took me away from Clark, I left.
Right.
Clark's a big part of the reason why I took off for Paris in the first place.
Oh, that must be from the book of things you never want to hear about your girlfriend's Ex.
Look Jason, I'm with you now and I couldn't be happier.
And I know,
Clark can be unpredictable, but he knows that you need this job to stay in college.
I know it's hard because you've been so close to him...
But are you sure you really know him?

You don't really want that.
You want to know why your Dad brought me here.
Not that badly.
What if we make a wager?
Now why would I take a bet when I can just have you thrown out of here?
Because I know gamblers better than anybody.
You're the caviar kind -
See when you hold everything in your hand, the only thing that can give you a thrill, is putting your chips on the one thing that can slip through your fingers.
And what would that one thing be, Mikhail?
Well in this case...
Me.
How much do you believe in this quarterback friend of yours, Clark Kent?
The Championship Game?
What's the wager?
If the Crows lose, you get Citizenship for me, and $1 million dollars to start again.
And if the Crows win,
I have a hard time believing you can cover that bet.
I can't.
But the reason your father brought me here is far more valuable than just money.
Oh look.
A real, live, American football superhero.
What are you doing here?
I came here to thank you for ratting me out to Lex.
It wasn't hard to figure out, I knew Chloe would squeal, just not to him.

Here's how the last play in my game goes.

Chloe's dead.
Kent.
Let's go.
We need an 'Ace-back Montana Post'.
This is it.
It's for the title.
Crows have it 1st and 10 on the 50-yard line.
5 seconds remaining on the clock.
Smallville has one more play.
Blue, 32!
Hut!
Touchdown!
The Crows win!
Clark Kent makes another unbelievable play!
Come on, man!
We're missing the party!
Looks like championship quarterbacks no longer have a curfew, huh?
I'm late...
Sorry.
Clark.
Your mother and I know that Mikhail was arrested.
Now, when I was out on that same field, all I had to worry about was completing the next pass, or whether or not I was going to get tackled.
We're very proud of you.
For everything.
- Hey you, come on.
Night.
- Good night.
I don't know what it is with you, but no matter how many times I put you in the penalty box, it never sticks.
I hear you're quite the hero tonight, Clark Kent.
Yeah well, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have won the game.
Yeah well, you can thank Uncle Sam for that.
My Uncle Sam.
It's amazing the access a 3-star-General has to cool toys.
And you never know when a jamming device for Stealth Fighters will come in handy in a football game!
Because of that jamming device, Mikhail can't control anyone anymore.
Awesome.
But what I don't understand is how I miraculously came untied.
And what I don't understand is how you got sucked into anything besides anonymous tips.
Well, we all have our weaknesses, I guess.
Except for you, of course.
I think you'll find your new accommodations a lot more comfortable than county lock-up.
And where are you taking me?
Don't worry.
You're going to have a lot of company.
I'm not worried, I have the feeling I can learn a lot from you, but
I'm just sorry we can't make good on our agreement.
You underestimate the value of my winnings.
I told you Mr. Luthor, I've lost my talent.
Mikhail, if there's one thing I've learned is that anything lost, can be found again.
If you knew I had a special talent, then why did you bet against me?
I didn't.
I bet on Clark Kent.
Like I said...
You're not alone.
Lana.
Where's Jason?
I've been looking for him, I actually left him 3 messages.
Yeah I know.
I thought he'd want to know that Metropolis University offered me a scholarship.
That's great Clark.
One of the scouts he called saw me in the game.
I wanted to thank him for trusting me.
Well it's too bad that you couldn't return the favor.
Jason was fired this morning.
It's good to know the local football star still has time for his friends.
I wouldn't put it like that.
Wild guess.
You're not talking about the 'football star' part.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
But what you and I talk about is supposed to stay between us.
I see.
So today I'm taking the role of the despicable untrustworthy friend, and as usual our hero is making the fatal flaw of jumping to conclusions.
You're going to tell me you weren't the one who got Jason fired?
A teacher-student liason is a taboo that's pretty hard to come back from.
Oh, you're going to take the moral high ground on this?
Clark, I'd hate to see Lana's infatuation earn her a 'Scarlet Letter' around town.
Well she has you to thank for that!
Cause you and I were the only two who knew about it, now everybody's talking.
You didn't do this to protect her.
You know Lana isn't meant to be with Jason.
Maybe a year ago, I would've believed that you got him fired out of some twisted loyalty for being my friend.
But you didn't do this for me.
Why did you do it?
Here's the kickoff
The winner of today's game will move on to the state championship 1 week from today
Play your game, buddy.
A victory today will send the crows to the state championship.
So, are you the guy?
I guess that depends on what you're looking for.
Mikhail Mxyzl...
Mxyzptlk.
Let me guess, you want to buy a vowel.
No, I just wanted to put 80 on the game.
You mean the game that started already.
Sorry I can't take a bet after the kickoff.
Rookie, huh?
Well, maybe in your case, I'll make an exception.
Thanks.
Can you put me down for Smallville to win?
You sure about that?
I have a funny feeling about the quarterback today.
Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I never bet against Clark Kent.
Suit yourself.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Rule #1
- A bet is a bet.
Alright guys here we go.
Ready?
Blue 32, Blue 32...
HUT!
Trip.
Touchdown!
Crows win the game!
Unbelievable!
fdfdfd
Is he okay?
His collarbone's broken in 2 places.
I can't figure out how you could pommel a guy that outweighs you by 100 pounds, and shatter his collarbone.
I'm sorry.
Must have been an accident, I mean, I got a surge of adrenaline.
Adrenaline doesn't explain the fact that you went from chucking balls of hay to chucking 60-yard passes overnight.
I guess I'm a fast learner, you said yourself I was a natural.
A natural who adamantly refuses to get a doctor after he collapsed 2 weeks ago.
What are you trying to say?
Coach Quigley thinks you're on some kind of performance-enhancing drug.
Like steroids?
What do you think?
I put myself on the line and said there's no way Clark Kent would do that.
I'm not on drugs.
I hope not.
Because if it comes out you're not on the same playing field as these guys, it's gonna be pretty disappointing to forfeit an entire championship season.
Obviously.
This is as far you can get from scavenging the street, but,
Growing up 'hand-to-mouth' does tend to make you resourceful.
Resourceful enough to get the attention of my father's LuthorCorp foreign scholarship.
So how do you like Smallville high
I think it is the perfect place for me to make my American dream.
There are many opportunities, and the girls are... pretty.
I hope the classes aren't too difficult for you.
I reviewed your application;
I must say I was surprised by your poor test scores and grades.
Look Mikhail, I'm just curious why my father would award a scholarship, historically earmarked for future Nobel- prize-winners to a perennial 'C' student.
You want to send me back.
No.
I'd just like to know what you're really doing here.
What potential did my father see in you, Mikhail?
Cut.
Potential you do not see on a report card, Mr. Luthor.
Hey!
I didn't realize bookies made house calls, especially after-hours.
Well, I guess I just walked into the Lion's mouth, eh?
What are you talking about?
You're a first timer, and you show up at the end of the season, I asked some questions.
I don't think it is coincidence that you are Smallville's most notorious whistle-blower.
Notorious, huh?
I like the sound of that.
This bet was just research for the article?
- Front page if you play your cards right.
I don't suppose that being a local celebrity will be good for business.
I think maybe you should change professions.
You just found my Achille's Heel.
- What, greed?
- No, pretty girls with infectious smiles.
I'm still writing the article.
If you don't even know when to place a bet, I don't think you have the inside scoop you're looking for.
Promise not to mention my name, and I'll let you 'shadow' me, I'll be your personal escort through the seedier parts of Smallville.
If I cut you a break, I expect a full behind-the-scenes story.
Of course, and the first stop is the Winner's Circle.
So, what are you going to do with the money?
- Textbooks
- Ooh, don't go too crazy, huh?
My dad's on unemployment, so my college fund took a massive hit this year.
How would you like to make enough money to pay an entire semester of tuition before you wake up tomorrow morning?
I have to go to the Shark's game in Metropolis tonight.
Sharks... 8-to-1.
Chloe, if you want the big article you have to get inside the mind of a gambler.
You have to be ready to raise the stakes.
That is, if you aren't scared.
Count me in.
There's more to life than championships, Clark.
I bet it's easy to say that when you have one.
Dad, when I put on that uniform, it's like I forget who I am, but at the same time, I've never known myself better.
It's more than just a game.
Clark, I allowed you join the football team because I though you understood your responsibility not to let anybody get hurt out there.
And I accepted that responsibility because I know I can control my abilities.
Then explain to me why there's a kid lying in a hospital bed right now?
Have you ever seen me trip...
Ever?
Something happened out on that field, it's like I couldn't control my own legs!
Just because you are strong, doesn't mean you can't get rattled out there like anybody else.
I'm sorry but the last place you should be is on that football field and you know it.
Coach Quigley's at the party tonight.
I'll call him and be the bad guy.
No, Dad.
Like you said, It's my responsibility.
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
What's up?
Kent, you saved the day!
What a play!
You put us in the championship!
No, the team put us in the championship.
- I can see the ring on my finger already.
- I can see the scholarships lined up.
Clark, you're here!
Coach, coach, coach!
Topeka West may have 3 titles under it's belt, but I know we have a real shot at the championship, and this year we have it all.
An inpenetrable defense, an aggressive offense...
And a GOLDEN ARM!
Let's go take the title home!
Coach, coach, coach!
I like the new textbooks!
Hi!
Don't worry, I just took 10 percent off the top for fun, the rest of my winnings are tucked safely away for college tuition.
I'm glad that my tip paid off for you.
Are you kidding me?
That game was awesome!
I haven't had that much fun on a couch since Johnny Rosenblatt in 5th grade!
I mean, all of those painted 'beer-bellies' and foam hands suddenly make sense when you have something riding on the game!
See, why would want to spoil all the fun by writing that article?
Because it just keeps getting juicier by the minute.
Are you sure about that?
Why, are you going to do something to change my mind?
Nice try, you're very cute.
But I already gave you anonymity, and it's going to press tonight.
- But you're only starting to scratch the surface, and I can give you so much more 'dirt'.
You're just trying to stall the article, aren't you?
I don't think you understand me, Chloe.
I always get what I want.
On looks, apparently, because your charm just ran out.
Stop.
Kiss me.
This is me asking you nicely.
Now you're going to drop that article, whether you want to or not.
I've never seen you miss before.
I've also never seen you shrink from responsibility, no matter how difficult.
You saw the look on those guys' faces, I couldn't let them down.
I just thought I could find a way to play like everyone else.
Clark.
Open your hand.
What are you doing?
You know how dangerous Kryptonite is!
I always get better after it's gone.
So what if I'm playing sick?
Other guys play injured.
And if Dad know I don't have my abilities and can't hurt anyone.
You are not taking meteor rocks on that field, I know it's hard, you can't make yourself sick!
And I can't quit either!
Clark, the answer is no.
You asked your father if we'd ever seen you trip before...
Never.
Not without Kryptonite.
I was so excited to see you get a chance to be like everyone else, that
I guess I forgot for a moment that you aren't.
I didn't think anything of it when you tripped, but you've never had mishaps like other kids.
Something happened to you out there.
And if you really want to play in the game on Saturday, you need to find out what it was.
It's alright Clark, you can stay.
I thought you had some self-imposed restraining order against me, does this mean you're talking to me again?
No it just means I'm taking a chance on getting your Dr. Jekyll side today.
What's up with the self-logging?
I watching the sports editor's tape of the game,
Trying to figure out what happened, but...
It's like I had no control, like my mind was sending one message, but my..
but your body was getting another.
Yeah.
It's Mikhail.
The foreign exchange kid?
- Mixa...
- Mxyzptlk.
Say that 3 times fast.
He's our new resident 'Puppet Master'.
This is kind of embarrassing, but... he made me kiss him.
Made you?
Yeah, it was just like how you explained your trip, it was like someone else was controlling me.
Yeah but, why would he want me to lose the game?
Clark, he's the biggest bookie in the school!
The power to control the odds.
Let me do a search on his name.
'0 Matches Found'
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Mxyzptlk didn't bring anything up.
Well what's that?
'Did you mean KLTPZYXM?
' It's Mikhail's name backwards.
- Looks like a nursery rhyme gone bad.
- Yeah, it's some legend from the Piatori region in the Balkans.
That's near where Mikhail's from.
It says the region's been terrorized for centuries by a bloodline of people, who can control the hand of luck.
It's not exactly luck if they're controlling people.
What does it say about the backwards name?
- The family changed their name a century ago and fled the area to escape the stigma after a village burned to the ground.
Looks like Mikhail's still running from his heritage.
It doesn't exactly say how to stop the kissing bandit, does it?
Oh, here!
According to the legends, the only thing that stopped them was a plague of locusts.
There may be one other force they didn't count on.
Think about it, who brought him here in the first place?
You want me to deport a LuthorCorp foreign exchange student?
Gambling on Crows games, isn't a sanctioned extracurricular activity.
I'm surprised you care so much about some half-rate bookie.
Or is there something else about Mikhail you aren't telling me?
Lex, you sponsored him, I just thought you might want to do something about it.
Of course I'll look into it.
I'm surprised you didn't go to the principal first, or Coach Teague.
But I see how that can be more complicated than it sounds.
Why would it be more complicated?
Come on.
I can't be the only one who's picked on Lana's fondness for quarterbacks.
Even retired ones.
Yeah, to be honest, it has been hard to see her with someone else.
Don't worry, Paris can have a magical effect on people, but... the enchantment has a funny way of waning the longer you're gone.
I know Lana.
She's never been this serious about anyone.
You sound awfully concerned about that for someone that let her walk out of his life.
I guess the whole 'If you love them, set them free' thing kind of backfired.
It's not about love, Clark.
It's about what you're willing to do for it.
On that field, you'll do whatever it takes to win.
But if you're not willing to do the same for Lana... maybe she doesn't mean as much to you as you think.
Clark on steroids.
It's a little hard to picture.
It happens to a lot of guys.
Want so badly to outperform everyone, before you know it, all they care about is winning, no matter what the cost.
You're not responsible for Clark.
Actually I am.
Coach Quigley asked me to give him a drug test, and I never mentioned it to Clark, so I lied and said it came back clean.
Why would you do that?
I don't know, cause I believe in Clark!
And because he knows about us.
I didn't want to stir the waters.
If he wanted to get back at me, all he has to do is tell somebody at the school, and I lose my job.
- Clark wouldn't make it personal.
- Why not?
I can't imagine what I'd do if someone tried to take you away from me.
Nobody took me away from Clark, I left.
Right.
Clark's a big part of the reason why I took off for Paris in the first place.
Oh, that must be from the book of things you never want to hear about your girlfriend's Ex.
Look Jason, I'm with you now and I couldn't be happier.
And I know,
Clark can be unpredictable, but he knows that you need this job to stay in college.
I know it's hard because you've been so close to him...
But are you sure you really know him?
Don't get me wrong, Mikhail.
I appreciate your entrepreneurial ingenuity, but importing Bookies tends to reflect poorly on a company.
These are just fun games.
The I.N.S. isn't exactly renowned for their good sportsmanship.
They're revoking your student visa and sending you back home.
But a man like you could pull strings to keep me here, yes?
If I wanted to.
But whatever talents my father saw in you, they're not worth the embarrassment you bring to me and my company.
I've made the arrangements, you'll be halfway across the Atlantic by morning.
You don't really want that.
You want to know why your Dad brought me here.
Not that badly.
What if we make a wager?
Now why would I take a bet when I can just have you thrown out of here?
Because I know gamblers better than anybody.
You're the caviar kind -
See when you hold everything in your hand, the only thing that can give you a thrill, is putting your chips on the one thing that can slip through your fingers.
And what would that one thing be, Mikhail?
Well in this case...
Me.
How much do you believe in this quarterback friend of yours, Clark Kent?
The Championship Game?
What's the wager?
If the Crows lose, you get Citizenship for me, and $1 million dollars to start again.
And if the Crows win,
I have a hard time believing you can cover that bet.
I can't.
But the reason your father brought me here is far more valuable than just money.
Oh look.
A real, live, American football superhero.
What are you doing here?
I came here to thank you for ratting me out to Lex.
It wasn't hard to figure out, I knew Chloe would squeal, just not to him.
She's too proud.
You seemed to be the common denominator, so you forget, games are my business, so if you don't know the players, you cannot guess the outcome.
I thought you'd be halfway back to the 'village of the damned' by now.
I'm not cursed, Clark.
I am lucky.
And on Saturday, the championship game, I'm going to be very lucky.
If you think I'm going to lose that game for you...
If... when there is an if, there are odds, and I always beat the odds.
Choke.
For example, the odds in the championship are based on you playing.
If you don't go out on the field, then my profit margin takes an unfortunate turn.
That is why you're not going to tell anyone else about me, and you're going to be on that field.
Unless, you want to see more of your buddies in the hospital.
Breathe.
- Chloe.
- Hey!
Clark, warm-up in 15 minutes.
I sure hope you had better luck with the locusts than I did with Lex.
They aren't selling biblical plagues on 'Amazon. com', but since every legend is born in truth, I did look up our favorite apocalyptic critters.
Besides eating crops in a single bound, what else can they do?
When locusts swarm, they emit an energy wave to avoid crashing into each other.
Maybe Mikhail's commands operate on a similar frequency, like a radio signal.
Or a dog whistle, the sound travels but the human ear doesn't pick it up.
Yeah.
What's interesting is once a locust's signal is jammed, they can't fly anymore without running into each other.
It's permanent.
Maybe all we have to do is find something that will jam Mikhail's frequency for good.
And I think I know where to find that, so now we just have to find him.
Knowing his quest for the American Dream, he's got a lot of bets riding on this game,
He'll be here.
- O.K.
- I gotta go.
- Good Luck.
- Thanks.
Greetings Football fans, and welcome to the Championship game between the
Topeka Valley Huskies, and your Smallville Crows!
Clark.
What are you doing?
You know what Mikhail said.
He'd hurt those guys if I wasn't out there.
250 pound guys banging into each other on a football field is one thing, but getting hit by you is like getting hit by a train, it's a big difference, son.
I hope that doesn't happen.
I think Chloe and I found a way to stop Mikhail.
Oh Chloe and You think you found a way to stop.
Well I'm sorry son, thinking is not good enough.
- Dad I know you don't agree with me, but sometimes taking responsibility means having faith in yourself to make the hard choices.
- It also means accepting the consequences.
Every handshake, every hug, every time I'm out on that field I make the conscious decision to fall when those guys hit me so they don't get hurt.
No matter how hard you try, you can't understand that.
That's why it's my decision, not yours.
You're starting to sound more and more like your father.
I hope so, Dad.
Trip.
Alright, let's go, let's go, come on!
Fumble.
I knew it was you Chloe!
Stop.
Looks like someone's been broken.
Sucks when you have to play fair doesn't it?
In my country, you don't survive if you can't adapt to the unexpected.
1st down, the Huskies call their last time-out!
Clark.
What are you doing here?
Here's how the last play in my game goes.
The Crows score another touchdown, Chloe's dead.
If you don't go on the field right now, and lose the game...
Chloe's dead.
Kent.
Let's go.
We need an 'Ace-back Montana Post'.
This is it.
It's for the title.
Crows have it 1st and 10 on the 50-yard line.

I'll be your personal escort through the seedier parts of Smallville.
If I cut you a break, I expect a full behind-the-scenes story.
Of course, and the first stop is the Winner's Circle.
So, what are you going to do with the money?
- Textbooks.
- Ooh, don't go too crazy, huh?
My dad's on unemployment, so my college fund took a massive hit this year.
How would you like to make enough money to pay an entire semester of tuition before you wake up tomorrow morning?
I have to go to the Shark's game in Metropolis tonight.
Sharks... 8-to-1.
Chloe, if you want the big article you have to get inside the mind of a gambler.
You have to be ready to raise the stakes.
That is, if you aren't scared.
Count me in.
There's more to life than championships, Clark.
I bet it's easy to say that when you have one.
Dad, when I put on that uniform, it's like I forget who I am, but at the same time, I've never known myself better.
It's more than just a game.
Clark, I allowed you join the football team because I though you understood your responsibility not to let anybody get hurt out there.
And I accepted that responsibility because I know I can control my abilities.
Then explain to me why there's a kid lying in a hospital bed right now?
Have you ever seen me trip...
Ever?
Something happened out on that field, it's like I couldn't control my own legs!
Just because you are strong, doesn't mean you can't get rattled out there like anybody else.
I'm sorry but the last place you should be is on that football field and you know it.
Coach Quigley's at the party tonight.
I'll call him and be the bad guy.
No, Dad.
Like you said, It's my responsibility.
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
What's up?
Kent, you saved the day!
What a play!
You put us in the championship!
No, the team put us in the championship.
- I can see the ring on my finger already.
- I can see the scholarships lined up.
Clark, you're here!
Coach, coach, coach!
Topeka West may have 3 titles under it's belt, but I know we have a real shot at the championship, and this year we got it all.
An impenetrable defense, an aggressive offense...
And a GOLDEN ARM!
Let's go take the title home!
Kent, Kent, Kent, Kent!
I like the new textbooks!
Hi!
Don't worry, I just took 10 percent off the top for fun, the rest of my winnings are tucked safely away for college tuition.
I'm glad that my tip paid off for you.
Are you kidding me?
That game was awesome!
I haven't had that much fun on a couch since Johnny Rosenblatt in 5th grade!
I mean, all of those painted "beer-bellies" and foam hands suddenly make sense when you have something riding on the game!
See, why would want to spoil all the fun by writing that article?
Because it just keeps getting juicier by the minute.
Are you sure about that?
Why, are you going to do something to change my mind?
Nice try, you're very cute.
But I already gave you anonymity, and
- it's going to press tonight.
- But you're only starting to scratch the surface, and I can give you so much more "dirt".
You're just trying to stall the article, aren't you?
I don't think you understand me, Chloe.
I always get what I want.
On looks, apparently, because your charm just ran out.
Stop.
Kiss me.
This is me asking you nicely.
Now you're going to drop that article, whether you want to or not.
I've never seen you miss before.
I've also never seen you shrink from responsibility, no matter how difficult.
You saw the look on those guys' faces, I couldn't let them down.
I just thought I could find a way to play like everyone else.
Clark.
Open your hand.
What are you doing?
You know how dangerous Kryptonite is!
I always get better after it's gone.
So what if I'm playing sick?
Other guys play injured.
And if Dad know I don't have my abilities and can't hurt anyone.
You are not taking meteor rocks on that field, I know it's hard, you can't make yourself sick!
And I can't quit either!
Clark, the answer is no.
You asked your father if we'd ever seen you trip before...
Never.
Not without Kryptonite.
I was so excited to see you get a chance to be like everyone else, that
I guess I forgot for a moment that you aren't.
I didn't think anything of it when you tripped, but you've never had mishaps like other kids.
Something happened to you out there.
And if you really want to play in the game on Saturday, you need to find out what it was.
It's alright Clark, you can stay.
I thought you had some self-imposed restraining order against me, does this mean you're talking to me again?
No it just means I'm taking a chance on getting your Dr. Jekyll side today.
What's up with the self-flogging?
I'm watching the sports editor's tape of the game,
Trying to figure out what happened, but...
It's like I had no control, like my mind was sending one message, but my...
But your body was getting another.
Yeah.
It's Mikhail.
The foreign exchange kid?
- Mixa...
- Mxyzptlk.
Say that 3 times fast.
He's our new resident "Puppet Master".
This is kind of embarrassing, but... he made me kiss him.
Made you?
Yeah, it was just like how you explained your trip, it was like someone else was controlling me.
Ok, but, why would he want me to throw the game?
Clark, he's the biggest bookie in the school!
The power to control the odds.
Let me do a search on his name.
"0 Matches Found"
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Mxyzptlk didn't bring anything up.
Well what's that?
"Did you mean KLTPZYXM?" It's Mikhail's name backwards.
- Looks like a nursery rhyme gone bad.
- Yeah, it's some legend from the Piatori region in the Balkans.
That's near where Mikhail's from.
It says the region's been terrorized for centuries by a bloodline of people, who can control the hand of luck.
It's not exactly luck if they're controlling people.
What does it say about the
- backwards name?
- The family changed their name a century ago and fled the area to escape the stigma after a village burned to the ground.
Looks like Mikhail's still running from his heritage.
It doesn't exactly say how to stop the kissing bandit, does it?
Oh, here!
According to the legends, the only thing that stopped them was a plague of locusts.
There may be one other force they didn't count on.
Think about it, who brought him here in the first place?
You want me to deport a LuthorCorp exchange student?
Gambling on Crows games, isn't a sanctioned extracurricular.
I'm surprised you care so much about some half-rate bookie.
Or is there something else about Mikhail you aren't telling me?
Lex, you sponsored him, I just thought you might want to do something about it.
Of course I'll look into it.
I'm surprised you didn't go to the principal first, or Coach Teague.
But I see how that can be more complicated than it sounds.
Why would it be more complicated?
Come on.
I can't be the only one who's picked on Lana's fondness for quarterbacks.
Even retired ones.
Yeah, to be honest, it has been hard to see her with someone else.
Don't worry, Paris can have a magical effect on people, but... the enchantment has a funny way of waning the longer you're gone.
I know Lana.
She's never been this serious about anyone.
You sound awfully concerned about that for someone that let her walk out of his life.
I guess the whole "If you love them, set them free" thing kind of backfired.
It's not about love, Clark.
It's about what you're willing to do for it.
On that field, you'll do whatever it takes to win.
But if you're not willing to do the same for Lana... maybe she doesn't mean as much to you as you think.
Clark on steroids.
It's a little hard to picture.
It happens to a lot of guys.
Want so badly to outperform everyone, before you know it, all they care about is winning, no matter what the cost.
You're not responsible for Clark.
Actually I am.
Coach Quigley asked me to give him a drug test, and I never mentioned it to Clark, so I lied and said it came back clean.
Why would you do that?
I don't know, cause I believe in Clark!
And because he knows about us.
I didn't want to stir the waters.
If he wanted to get back at me, all he has to do is tell somebody at the school, and I lose my job.
- Clark wouldn't make it personal.
- Why not?
I can't imagine what I'd do if someone tried to take you away from me.
Nobody took me away from Clark, I left.
Right.
Clark's a big part of the reason why I took off for Paris in the first place.
Oh, that must be from the book of things you never want to hear about your girlfriend's Ex.
Look Jason, I'm with you now and I couldn't be happier.
And I know,
Clark can be unpredictable, but he knows that you need this job to stay in college.
I know it's hard because you've been so close to him...
But are you sure you really know him?
Don't get me wrong, Mikhail.
I appreciate your entrepreneurial ingenuity, but importing Bookies tends to reflect poorly on a company.
These are just fun games.
The I.N.S. isn't exactly renowned for their good sportsmanship.
They're revoking your student visa and sending you back home.
But a man like you could pull strings to keep me here, yes?
If I wanted to.
But whatever talents my father saw in you, they're not worth the embarrassment you bring to me and my company.
I've made the arrangements, you'll be halfway across the Atlantic by morning.
You don't really want that.
You want to know why your Dad brought me here.
Not that badly.
What if we make a wager?
Now why would I take a bet when I can just have you thrown out of here?
Because I know gamblers better than anybody.
You're the caviar kind -
See when you hold everything in your hand, the only thing that can give you a thrill, is putting your chips on the one thing that can slip through your fingers.
And what would that one thing be, Mikhail?
Well in this case...
Me.
How much do you believe in this quarterback friend of yours, Clark Kent?
The Championship Game?
What's the wager?
If the Crows lose, you get Citizenship for me, and $1 million dollars to start again.
And if the Crows win,
I have a hard time believing you can cover that bet.
I can't.
But the reason your father brought me here is far more valuable than just money.
Oh look.
A real, live, American football superhero.
What are you doing here?
I came here to thank you for ratting me out to Lex.
It wasn't hard to figure out, I knew Chloe would squeal, just not to him.
She's too proud.
You seemed to be the common denominator, so you forget, games are my business, so if you don't know the players, you cannot guess the outcome.
I thought you'd be halfway back to the "village of the damned" by now.
I'm not cursed, Clark.
I am lucky.
And on Saturday, the championship game, I'm going to be very lucky.
If you think I'm going to lose that game for you...
If... when there is an if, there are odds, and I always beat the odds.
Choke.
For example, the odds in the championship are based on you playing.
If you don't go out on the field, then my profit margin takes an unfortunate turn.
That is why you're not going to tell anyone else about me, and you're going to be on that field.
Unless, you want to see more of your buddies in the hospital.
Breathe.
- Chloe.
- Hey!
Clark, warm-up in 15 minutes.
I sure hope you had better luck with the locusts than I did with Lex. is born in truth, I did look up our favorite apocalyptic critters.
Besides eating crops in a single bound, what else can they do?
When locusts swarm, they emit an energy wave to avoid crashing into each other.
Maybe Mikhail's commands operate on a similar frequency, like a radio signal.
Or a dog whistle, the sound travels but the human ear doesn't pick it up.
Yeah.
What's interesting is once a locust's signal is jammed, they can't fly anymore without running into each other.
It's permanent.
Maybe all we have to do is find something that will jam Mikhail's frequency for good.
And I think I know where to find that, so now we just have to find him.
Knowing his quest for the American Dream, he's got a lot of bets riding on this game,
He'll be here.
- Ok.
- I gotta go.
- Good Luck.
- Thanks.
Greetings Football fans, and welcome to the Championship game between the
Topeka Valley Huskies, and your Smallville Crows!
Clark.
What are you doing?
You know what Mikhail said.
He'd hurt those guys if I wasn't out there.
250 pound guys banging into each other on a football field is one thing, but getting hit by you is like getting hit by a train, it's a big difference, son.
I hope that doesn't happen.
I think Chloe and I found a way to stop Mikhail.
Oh Chloe and You think you found a way to stop.
Well I'm sorry son,
- thinking is not good enough.
- Dad I know you don't agree with me, but sometimes taking responsibility means having faith in yourself to make
- the hard choices.
- It also means accepting the consequences.
Every handshake, every hug, every time I'm out on that field I make the conscious decision to fall when those guys hit me so they don't get hurt.
No matter how hard you try, you can't understand that.
That's why it's my decision, not yours.
You're starting to sound more and more like your father.
I hope so, Dad.
Trip.
Alright, let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on!
Fumble.
I knew it was you Chloe!
Stop.
Looks like someone's been broken.
Sucks when you have to play fair doesn't it?
In my country, you don't survive if you can't adapt to the unexpected.
1st down, the Huskies call their last time-out!
Clark.
What are you doing here?
Here's how the last play in my game goes.
The Crows score another touchdown, Chloe's dead.
If you don't go on the field right now, and lose the game...
Chloe's dead.
Kent.
Let's go.
We need an "Ace-back Montana Post".
This is it.
It's for the title.
Crows have it 1st and 10 on the 50-yard line.
5 seconds remaining on the clock.
Smallville has one more play.
Blue, 32!
Hut!
Touchdown!
The Crows win!
Clark Kent makes another unbelievable play!
Come on, man!
We're missing the party!
Looks like championship quarterbacks no longer have a curfew, huh?
I'm late...
Sorry.
Clark.
Your mother and I know that Mikhail was arrested.
Now, when I was out on that same field, all I had to worry about was completing the next pass, or whether or not I was going to get tackled.
We're very proud of you.
For everything.
- Hey you, come on.
Night.
- Good night.
I don't know what it is with you, but no matter how many times I put you in the penalty box, it never sticks.
I hear you're quite the hero tonight, Clark Kent.
Yeah well, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have won the game.
Yeah well, you can thank Uncle Sam for that.
My Uncle Sam.
It's amazing the access a 3-star-General has to cool toys.
And you never know when a jamming device for Stealth Fighters will come in handy in a football game!
Because of that jamming device, Mikhail can't control anyone anymore.
Awesome.
But what I don't understand is how I miraculously came untied.
And what I don't understand is how you got sucked into anything besides anonymous tips.
Well, we all have our weaknesses, I guess.
Except for you, of course.
I think you'll find your new accommodations a lot more comfortable than county lock-up.
And where are you taking me?
Don't worry.
You're going to have a lot of company.
I'm not worried, I have the feeling I can learn a lot from you, but
I'm just sorry we can't make good on our agreement.
You underestimate the value of my winnings.
I told you Mr. Luthor, I've lost my talent.
Mikhail, if there's one thing I've learned is that anything lost, can be found again.
If you knew I had a special talent, then why did you bet against me?
I didn't.
I bet on Clark Kent.
Like I said...
You're not alone.
Lana.
Where's Jason?
I've been looking for him, I actually left him 3 messages.
Yeah I know.
I thought he'd want to know that Metropolis University offered me a scholarship.
That's great Clark.
One of the scouts he called saw me in the game.
I wanted to thank him for trusting me.
Well it's too bad that you couldn't return the favor.
Jason was fired this morning.
It's good to know the local football star still has time for his friends.
I wouldn't put it like that.
Wild guess.
You're not talking about the "football star" part.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
But what you and I talk about is supposed to stay between us.
I see.
So today I'm taking the role of the despicable untrustworthy friend, and as usual our hero is making the fatal flaw of jumping to conclusions.
You're going to tell me you weren't the one who got Jason fired?
A teacher-student liaison is a taboo that's pretty hard to come back from.
Oh, you're going to take the moral high ground on this?
Clark, I'd hate to see Lana's infatuation earn her a "Scarlet Letter" around town.
Well she has you to thank for that!
Cause you and I were the only two who knew about it, now everybody's talking.
You didn't do this to protect her.
You know Lana isn't meant to be with Jason.
Maybe a year ago, I would've believed that you got him fired out of some twisted loyalty for being my friend.
But you didn't do this for me.
Why did you do it?
Paige, there you are!
Has anyone gotten hurt?
Not as far as I can tell.
Have you seen Agent Brody yet?
What are we doing here?
Well, he said for us to meet him here.
He needed to talk to us about something important.
Yeah, but, Paige, it's a fire.
So?
So we don't do fires.
Firemen do fires.
We do fireballs.
Look, he said it was something connected to this New Power thing he's been talking about.
Yeah, well, we're not Brody's Angels.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's just I'm stressed, it's my first week back at work, and I have a lot of catching up to do.
Follow me.
Keep an eye on the third floor.
Wait -- why?
Because somebody's trapped inside, and if I'm right, he's gonna jump and he's not gonna get hurt.
How do you know?
It's just a hunch.
Just a hunch, huh, Agent Brody?
Kyle.
Whatever.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but we don't really know you.
And I know you were right about the whole New Power thing, ...
He's on the ledge!
He's gonna jump!
Help!
Bring the ladder over here!
Are you all right?
Okay, how did you know that?
Because that's the fourth person it's happened to in the last month.
Which means if the pattern holds, he's about to die.
Pattern?
What pattern?
What?
All right, guys.
Stay on the survivor.
And keep recording.
God, is he talking to that helicopter?
He's really cool.
Go!
I'm okay!
EMT needs to check you out first.
Down there.
Sir?
Sir, hold on a second.
Sir, wait.
Sir --
Noooo!
Stop.
Watch for the --
Who are you?
A thief.
Looks like you're on your own.
No, no, no, wait!
Damn it!
Charmed Season 7 Episode 07 "Someone to Witch Over Me"
Transcript :
Intrepid.
Synchro :
Greatouille.
I still don't understand how he knew this was gonna happen.
I don't know why we couldn't have stopped it.
Stopped what?
A jumper jumped out of a burning building only to get hit by a truck?
I mean, what's the connection there?
I'm hoping Kyle knows.
Okay, you know, can we please call him "Agent Brody" until we can trust him?
I trust him.
You okay?
No.
Just wish I knew why this keeps happening.
Well, you said something about a pattern, right?
Yeah.
Every time something unusual happens, I investigate.
The more unusual it is, the more it tends to lead me towards this New Power I was telling you about.
Does this New Power have a name?
I don't know yet.
You guys wanna walk?
So you think that whole thing is what's killing these innocents?
Well, I don't think they're literally running them down if that's what you're asking, but I do think they're doing something to cause them to get killed.
Hmm.
What kind of something?
I don't know.
But whatever it is, it's got something to do with taking powers, 'cause that's what they're all about.
Wait.
Powers?
Innocents don't have powers.
If they did, they wouldn't need us.
All I know is that things this unusual don't just happen like this over and over again.
I mean, something's going on here.
Another hunch?
Don't knock it, Phoebe.
My hunches led me to you.
Look.
I can guarantee you this is not gonna be the last person to miraculously escape a fire only to die moments later.
If you guys wanna help me figure this one out you know where to find me.
What do you think?
I think he's got some style.
How dare you summon me.
You said to call if I ever wanted to challenge you.
You think you are ready to challenge me?
The last time you tried it, I spared your life.
This time, I may not be so merciful.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
You've been around humans too long.
What makes you think you're ready?
Like you said, I've been around humans.
Shall we?
Talk to me.
You've come far quickly.
Not far enough.
I need more!
More what?
More Guardians.
I steal the ones who help save their humans so that they can help me instead.
All this just to defeat me?
No.
So that I can protect myself from the great threat you taught us was coming.
Nothing can protect you from that.
Unless you go into hiding until--
I won't hide!
If demons don't stand up to them, who will?
I just need more.
Could you do me a favor and call Rex and have them do a sound check before the show?
I don't want to mess up The Donnas' album release party.
It's gonna be packed.
Piper, are you even listening to me?
Yeah, yeah.
Brody, fires, hunches.
I got my own problems.
Are you sure Enola graduated already?
Yeah, I'm positive.
Why?
Because she might be the only one who can save Leo.
What are you talking about?
Well, she helped you see your future with a Vision Quest, right?
Gave you something to look forward to, life after demons...
That's what Leo needs.
Yeah, but there's no guarantees that Leo would see that.
I mean, a Vision Quest can take you anywhere, and sometimes it can even be dangerous.
Couldn't be any more dangerous than what he's going through right now if that stupid New Power is still after him.
A Vision Quest won't change that.
No, but it may show him a way to fight them.
Phoebe, he's alone and he's scared, and he's forgotten who he is.
I'm afraid if I can't help him now, my children are gonna lose their father.
It's still risky.
Yeah, but it's a risk I'm willing to take.
What are you doing?
I'm making the Vision Quest potion.
She showed me how to do it.
And what about Brody?
Paige can take care of Brody.
I think she likes taking care of Brody if you know what I'm talking about.
Besides, this... is family.
Nobody's home.
You're quite the liar.
Sorry.
Didn't realize it was you.
Actually, I'm surprised you even showed up.
Really?
Why would that be?
I think it's pretty clear that your sister doesn't trust me very much.
Should she?
Yeah, I think she should.
I think I've proven myself.
I've saved you from getting exposed more than once.
By the way, where is Inspector Sheridan?
Does it really matter?
Uh ... it does if you hurt her.
I'm not here to hurt anybody, Paige.
I'm here to keep them from getting hurt, remember?
The fact that you know that people may die is exactly what makes you so suspicious, Agent Brody.
Kyle.
What is that?
That is a bird's-eye view of the victim just before he stepped off of the curb.
Now, we shot this with the fastest digital imaging equipment known to man or at least Homeland Security, anyway.
Now, if you look at it in normal light, it appears as though he's alone.
I throw an E.M. filter on it he's not.
What are those?
If I had to guess, I'd say the light one's a protector of some kind.
Uh ...
Protector of what?
Like some sort of Guardian Angel thing?
That's one way of putting it.
What, you don't believe in them?
You do?
Given all the scrapes that I've slipped out of, it's the only reason why I think I'm still alive.
My guess is that that's the power that the dark figure wants... people who have especially strong protectors.
That would explain why they miraculously survive something and in the next moment don't.
What?
Nothing.
So, uh ... how do we find out if that dark figure is what you think it is?
We wait for the next fire.
Interested?
There's nowhere else to turn.
Nowhere else to go.
Leave me alone.
Let go of all you know.
Don't resist us.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
Perhaps we've pushed him too far.
We have no choice.
He must join us willingly, but first must see there is no other option.
But his will is strong, even for an Elder.
Which is why he's so valuable to us.
What is it?
There may be another way, another opportunity to show him that one cannot ignore the truth forever.
Leo?
Leo?
You see, I know he can hear me.
He just doesn't wanna come.
Let me give this a try.
Leo!
Leo, you get your butt down here right now or we will summon your ass!
Nicely done.
It's not safe for me to be here.
You know that.
We'll take that risk.
What about the boys?
They're at school.
Nice try, though.
We think we found a way to help you.
Help me what?
Help you stop running.
It's a Vision Quest.
A Vision Quest.
No way.
Leo, don't you dare leave.
This is not just about you.
You are a father and somebody's husband, too.
Which is why it's too risky for me to be here.
Yeah, except you're the one that's in danger.
I'm an Elder.
I can take care of myself.
Actually, you haven't really been yourself lately.
Look, Leo, the Vision Quest helped me, and we're thinking maybe it could help you too, you know?
Won't stop the creatures.
How do you know?
You've tried everything else.
What do you have to lose...
your mind, your family, your life?
You've already lost all those things, haven't you?
Go ahead, tell me I'm wrong.
I'll go get the potion.
Okay, when I said I'd help you, this is not what I had in mind.
Just go.
I'll be okay.
Are you crazy?
How is this gonna be okay?
Because I believe in my guardian, remember?
Look, if I'm right, whoever set this fire is out there waiting for mine, so just say your spell when I'm safe and we'll see what happens.
Don't worry about me.
Yeah.
It's a little late for that!
Which way?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Homeland Security.
Paige!
Paige!
Go!
Show me what the evil sees
Even if at lightning speeds.
So it is true.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
A witch?
You're not getting his Guardian.
Now, why would I want his when I can have yours?
What's the matter, huh?
What's wrong?
I think I'm in big trouble.
No, I know, Elise, but something came up.
Yes, again, but you don't have to worry about my column.
I promise it'll -- uh, I gotta go.
What's goin' on?
Pai --oh, my god!
What happened?
Par for the course, unfortunately.
"Par for what course", and what are you doing here?
Trying to protect your sister.
I lost my Guardian Angel.
You lost your who?
Protection spirits, guides.
They're with us all the time.
Yes.
I know what Guardian Angels are.
Thank you.
Not just the hallmark thing.
It's real.
I actually saw mine.
I'm surprised we've not seen them before.
Yeah, the problem is without them, people tend to be vulnerable.
In my case, accident-prone.
Okay, I don't understand.
How did you lose your Guardian Angel?
Well, actually, we tried to lose mine, but then this demon... it was a demon, right?
Demon.
Yeah, demon comes along and takes hers instead.
Can I talk to you for a second, please, over here?
What is going on?
What's going on is that we figured out what is killing all of those innocents.
The demon is stealing their protectors.
We think it's somehow connected to this whole New Power thing.
And let me guess.
This is another one of his hunches?
No.
It's one of mine.
But you have to admit, all of his have panned out so far, right?
Yeah.
So far, they have.
So what's the next move?
Well, I'm gonna go I.D. the demon.
Have you seen the Book of Shadows?
It wasn't upstairs.
Why?
You're not gonna show him the Book of Shadows, are you?
Yeah, I am.
I trust him.
I told you that.
If it considers him a threat, it'll just zap him.
Don't worry.
Paige, you're my sister.
I have to worry.
Well, if it makes you feel better, why don't you just come with us?
I wish I could, but I can't.
Leo needs some ... serious help.
What's new?
Just promise me you're gonna be careful.
I promise.
I think I can take care of one little demon.
I meant Agent Brody.
The Book's in the kitchen.
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
No problem.
She lost her what?
Agent Brody is watching her.
She's okay.
We can't leave her alone if she lost her Guardian An -
Phoebe said she's fine.
Now, would you please focus?
What am I supposed to do?
Don't fight it.
Just let it take you to where you're supposed to be.
What if I wanna get out?
You won't be able to, not until you see what you're supposed to see.
Just sip it.
Now what?
Make yourself comfortable.
Close your eyes and just let it all go.
We gotta stop the bleeding!
He's going into shock!
I need a morphine kit!
Is there a medic out in the field?
What's going on?
What am I doing here?
Don't worry, dad.
I'm gonna help you through this.
Chris?
Chris?
Thank you.
Guess I never knew how much my Guardian Angel actually helped me, even with the little stuff.
Don't worry.
We'll find her.
I hope.
You know, maybe it'd help if you looked at the Book with me.
Feel better?
What do you mean?
Well, I assume the Book won't let anything evil touch it.
Most magical tomes don't.
What do I have to do to prove that I'm not a threat to you?
Look, I'm -
- I'm sorry.
I am.
I can't seem to trust myself right now, let alone anybody else.
Well, the Guardians did more than keep you upright.
They're your inner voice, your conscience, instincts, and without them, you tend to get a little lost.
You really do believe in them, don't you?
Yeah.
I'm a believer, all right.
Hunting the New Power for years has made me realize that there are some awful things in this world.
I just like to think that there's some good things, too, to balance it out.
Like you.
You found it.
"Celerity demon"
"Celerity demons are powerful beings who can move at the speed of light and feed off lesser demons."
Yeah, but Guardian Angels are hardly lesser demons.
Well, whether they are or they aren't, he's able to steal them.
The question is why?
Well done.
Witches have powerful Guardians...
especially a Charmed One's.
How can you be sure that she was a Charmed One?
It's the only explanation.
It's the most powerful one I possess.
Still ... it will not be enough when the Avatars come.
Perhaps not.
Unless I get the other two.
After all, legend holds that the sisters are magically connected.
Stands to reason that their Guardians should be as well.
How will you get them?
I'll just ...
listen to the one I've got.
She'll whisper to me when the others need their Guardians the most, when they're the most vulnerable.
You've taught me well, Aku.
I hope ... well enough.
Why isn't he saying anything?
So you think he's all right?
Yes.
I think he's doing exactly what he needs to be doing.
You sure you don't wanna help me out here?
No.
I'm fine right here.
Sweetie, you said it yourself.
This is something that he needs to do.
Yeah, well, I can have second thoughts, can't I?
What if something happens to him?
Well, hopefully his Guardian Angels are taking care of him.
I don't think Angels have Angels, Phoebe.
It's redundant.
You just protect ours so we can protect him.
So I don't understand.
If I'm in the past, what are you doing here?
I'm guiding you.
So you're real?
No.
But I represent something that is.
I died in your arms, dad, killed by everything that you thought was good.
I'm your root pain, okay?
And I'm gonna be sticking with you until you're ready to let me go.
How will I know when that is?
Come on.
Let's check out some parts of your life that you really need to remember.
Do I have a choice?
Hey, it's your Vision Quest.
It's up to you.
Come on.
Where are we now?
I never stopped loving you.
That feeling's what it's all about, dad.
You died fighting evil in the war, then you were reborn as a Whitelighter to fight evil again.
That led you to mom ...
love ... to all that's good.
Is that what I think it is?
To the day Wyatt was born.
Yes, it is.
Oh, it's a boy.
You mean, I got a boy?
Here you go mama.
Hi.
Hi, little guy.
What are you doing?
Look what we did.
I see.
It's a miracle.
A little miracle.
To the day when I was born.
Oh, look.
He's beautiful.
Baby Christopher, that's your brother.
Looks like we didn't lose him after all.
Do you understand now?
All the pain, all the sacrifices, it's all been for good.
That's what you're all about, dad.
That's what you've always been about.
That's what the future's about, too.
Look at your brother.
You just need to believe in that again.
Can we see her?
Go.
Your family's waiting for you.
Piper.
How you feeling?
Good.
Wait.
What?
What is it?
Leo?
Leo, wake up.
Leo!
Wake up!
Who are you?
What do you want?
I want you to see the truth, Leo.
I want you to see the real future.
We've got to do something.
There's nothing that we can do.
He's back in the Quest.
Only he can get himself out of it.
But he was just out.
Something made him go back in, something he saw.
I don't think anything can get past the crystals.
What about the New Power?
I didn't see any floating heads.
It doesn't mean they weren't there.
Why are you doing this?
...
Why are you doing this to me?
I want to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, Leo.
You're not ready.
You haven't seen what you need to see.
Why are you haunting me?
Haunting?
No.
The Creature Heads were a necessary part of guiding you to the truth.
To the truth that lies beyond Good and Evil.
To us.
Us?
Avatars.
We are ... a power.
One that offers a better way, a solution to this.
You see, Leo, the future Chris failed to mention... the death of all the people that you love, sometimes peaceful... sometimes painful... but always inevitable.
And all well before their time.
Death is a part of life.
Natural death, yes.
But not death caused by the... pointless, endless, battles...
It's not pointless.
It's necessary.
And when good wins -
Wins?
Duality is self-perpetuating.
It feeds only on itself.
That is why the battle has been raging since the dawn of time.
There is no winner.
There can be.
How?
With Good, there is always Evil.
And so the battle never ends.
Not until there's nothing left.
That is the future your fight is leading to.
Not Good nor Evil.
Only nothing.
Leo.
Who are you talking to?
I'm afraid he can't hear you.
Well, he's hearing someone.
Leo.
Leo!
What was that?
Stay here.
Why?
Just ... stay.
Guess your Guardians didn't tell you about that.
That's why I want yours...
so these kinds of things don't happen again.
Damn it!
Paige, quick!
In here!
You're gettin' to be a pain.
You can't hide in there forever!
Paige?
What the hell?
Leave him alone!
No.
There's too much at stake.
Besides, I could use the leverage.
Oh, no.
You're not a witch.
What are you?
I'm a Federal Agent.
A what?
And you know about all this?
Magic?
Demons?
I'm getting a quick education.
It won't do you much good.
I only need you long enough for the witches to attempt a rescue.
And since they're obviously otherwise occupied and down a guardian, they won't come all at once.
Someone will get left behind.
And that's when I'll attack.
I'm just curious.
What do you want with all these Guardians if you don't mind me asking.
I don't want them.
I need them.
Worried about the New Power, are we?
You know about the Avatars?
Avatars?
So that's what they're called?
Yes, that's what they're called.
And I, for one, won't be cast aside by them when the time comes for them to take power.
Which is why I need more Guardians, which is the only reason I'm keeping you alive.
So what are you going to do if you find him?
What do you mean, what am I going to do?
I'm going to save him.
We are going to save him.
But it's a trap.
The demon said so himself.
He just took him for leverage.
So we're just going to let him get killed?
He's not going to kill him, okay?
He needs him alive.
Yeah, but for how long?
Piper, help me out.
I'm with Phoebe here.
Sarpedon's really powerful, and he's got all those Guardians.
Yeah, including mine.
And that's why you're not thinking straight!
Paige, we can't go after him.
It's ridiculous.
Yeah?
Well, I'm not just going to let him rot, either.
I'll go get him myself.
Okay, so now that we know where they are, all we have to do is mix up a new vanquishing potion and get Paige's spell.
Yeah, but that would mean we would have to go to the Book, which is in the kitchen and which entails us going downstairs away from the crystals, which means the demon could slice and dice us.
True, but for all we know, the demon could already have Paige.
Us getting killed doesn't change that.
Besides, I can't leave Leo.
Okay, I know this is really hard for you, Piper, but there's nothing that we can do to help Leo.
He's got to fight this fight on his own.
But we can help Paige.
All right.
Let's just make it fast.
Okay.
Remember, if the demon attacks, grab the amulet.
Oh, sure, yeah.
No problem.
Phoebe!
Next.
Hey!
Where's your amulet?
No!
Leo.
What do you mean this is the end?
The end of what?
The end of the battle between Good and Evil, its outcome... mutual destruction, and the eternal void that necessarily follows.
How is this possible?
I'm afraid it's unavoidable.
A flawed design.
There is, however, another way, a better way.
That is what we represent, Leo.
But we'll need your help to implement it.
And The Charmed Ones, of course, when they're ready.
What way is that?
Utopia.
A world where good and evil no longer exist, where the battle is behind you, behind everyone.
A world where you and Piper no longer have to suffer through the obstacles that have kept you apart.
What's the catch?
Only the courage to change.
Unless it's already too late.
Piper.
She's not here, Leo.
I'm afraid there isn't much time.
Piper?
Piper!
Why did you do this?
We didn't do this, Leo, evil did.
It might not be too late, though, to reverse it if you'll join us.
You can save them?
We can save everyone, Leo, with your help.
So be it.
Welcome to the fold.
What do I do next?
Heal them.
I can't heal them, they're dead.
You're an Avatar now, Leo.
You have all you need.
You have the powers.
Leo?
Piper.
You're back.
I thought I was Dead?
Where did you get that?
Oh, from the demon, I guess.
What, so that's it?
It's over?
Is it?
I've never seen you heal anyone like that, Leo.
Did something happen to you?
What do you mean?
In the Vision Quest, you seemed like you were in pain.
Yeah.
Well ... it's something I had to go through, I guess, to see the truth.
I can't believe she bought it she got too close and she caught it had a point, but she forgot it
how long is she gonna be around?
And how long do we have to watch her dumb it down?
'Cause when it's cheap, it fades fast and how long does she think it's gonna last?
You're gonna fall behind me you're gonna cry and beg for mercy 'cause you're not ready, baby and you got nothing on me
and you got nothing on me and you got nothing on me
Give it up for San Francisco's very own, The Donnas!
Thanks for getting Rex to do that sound check.
They sounded great.
Yeah.
Actually, I forgot to do that.
What?
I was very busy trying to save your husband.
All right.
Down girl.
Easy.
Don't worry about it.
I guess I get a little testy when someone kills me, you know.
Oh, come on.
We weren't killed, we were just maimed.
Leo can't heal the dead.
Hey, ladies.
Sorry I'm late.
Ooh, you guys look great for being recently deceased.
We weren't dead.
Ah, forget it.
Oh, hey--
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
My bad.
I see you got your Angel back.
Thank God.
No pun intended.
What about Agent Brody?
Who?
All right.
Kyle.
You know, just because we almost got him killed doesn't mean we have to trust him.
Ah, come on now.
Enough of this already.
Everything turned out fine, like it always does.
Well, almost always does.
Except for the Avatars.
Kyle said that's what the demon called the New Power.
Doesn't ring any bells.
Well, well, well, look at you.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
It's good to be back.
Believe me.
No more voices, floating heads, guilt trips?
Nope.
Nothing.
Ever hear of the Avatars?
Avatars?
Why?
I guess they could be the big bad everyone's worried about.
I will look into it.
But first, a toast to being back together.
New beginnings.
I will drink to that.
Paige, there you are!
Has anyone gotten hurt?
Not as far as I can tell.
Have you seen Agent Brody yet?
What are we doing here?
Well, he said for us to meet him here.
He needed to talk to us about something important.
Yeah, but, Paige, it's a fire.
So?
So we don't do fires.
Firemen do fires.
We do fireballs.
Look, he said it was something connected to this New Power thing he's been talking about.
Yeah, well, we're not Brody's Angels.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's just I'm stressed, it's my first week back at work, and I have a lot of catching up to do.
Follow me.
Keep an eye on the third floor.
Wait -- why?
Because somebody's trapped inside, and if I'm right, he's gonna jump and he's not gonna get hurt.
How do you know?
It's just a hunch.
Just a hunch, huh, Agent Brody?
Kyle.
Whatever.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but we don't really know you.
And I know you were right about the whole New Power thing, ...
He's on the ledge!
He's gonna jump!
Help!
Bring the ladder over here!
Are you all right?
Okay, how did you know that?
Because that's the fourth person it's happened to in the last month.
Which means if the pattern holds, he's about to die.
Pattern?
What pattern?
What?
All right, guys.
Stay on the survivor.
And keep recording.
God, is he talking to that helicopter?
He's really cool.
Go!
I'm okay!
EMT needs to check you out first.
Down there.
Sir?
Sir, hold on a second.
Sir, wait.
Sir --
Noooo!
Stop.
Watch for the --
Who are you?
A thief.
Looks like you're on your own.
No, no, no, wait!
Damn it!
Charmed Season 7 Episode 07 "Someone to Witch Over Me"
Transcript :
Intrepid.
Synchro :
Greatouille.
I still don't understand how he knew this was gonna happen.
I don't know why we couldn't have stopped it.
Stopped what?
A jumper jumped out of a burning building only to get hit by a truck?
I mean, what's the connection there?
I'm hoping Kyle knows.
Okay, you know, can we please call him "Agent Brody" until we can trust him?
I trust him.
You okay?
No.
Just wish I knew why this keeps happening.
Well, you said something about a pattern, right?
Yeah.
Every time something unusual happens, I investigate.
The more unusual it is, the more it tends to lead me towards this New Power I was telling you about.
Does this New Power have a name?
I don't know yet.
You guys wanna walk?
So you think that whole thing is what's killing these innocents?
Well, I don't think they're literally running them down if that's what you're asking, but I do think they're doing something to cause them to get killed.
Hmm.
What kind of something?
I don't know.
But whatever it is, it's got something to do with taking powers, 'cause that's what they're all about.
Wait.
Powers?
Innocents don't have powers.
If they did, they wouldn't need us.
All I know is that things this unusual don't just happen like this over and over again.
I mean, something's going on here.
Another hunch?
Don't knock it, Phoebe.
My hunches led me to you.
Look.
I can guarantee you this is not gonna be the last person to miraculously escape a fire only to die moments later.
If you guys wanna help me figure this one out you know where to find me.
What do you think?
I think he's got some style.
How dare you summon me.
You said to call if I ever wanted to challenge you.
You think you are ready to challenge me?
The last time you tried it, I spared your life.
This time, I may not be so merciful.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
You've been around humans too long.
What makes you think you're ready?
Like you said, I've been around humans.
Shall we?
Talk to me.
You've come far quickly.
Not far enough.
I need more!
More what?
More Guardians.
I steal the ones who help save their humans so that they can help me instead.
All this just to defeat me?
No.
So that I can protect myself from the great threat you taught us was coming.
Nothing can protect you from that.
Unless you go into hiding until--
I won't hide!
If demons don't stand up to them, who will?
I just need more.
Could you do me a favor and call Rex and have them do a sound check before the show?
I don't want to mess up The Donnas' album release party.
It's gonna be packed.
Piper, are you even listening to me?
Yeah, yeah.
Brody, fires, hunches.
I got my own problems.
Are you sure Enola graduated already?
Yeah, I'm positive.
Why?
Because she might be the only one who can save Leo.
What are you talking about?
Well, she helped you see your future with a Vision Quest, right?
Gave you something to look forward to, life after demons...
That's what Leo needs.
Yeah, but there's no guarantees that Leo would see that.
I mean, a Vision Quest can take you anywhere, and sometimes it can even be dangerous.
Couldn't be any more dangerous than what he's going through right now if that stupid New Power is still after him.
A Vision Quest won't change that.
No, but it may show him a way to fight them.
Phoebe, he's alone and he's scared, and he's forgotten who he is.
I'm afraid if I can't help him now, my children are gonna lose their father.
It's still risky.
Yeah, but it's a risk I'm willing to take.
What are you doing?
I'm making the Vision Quest potion.
She showed me how to do it.
And what about Brody?
Paige can take care of Brody.
I think she likes taking care of Brody if you know what I'm talking about.
Besides, this... is family.
Nobody's home.
You're quite the liar.
Sorry.
Didn't realize it was you.
Actually, I'm surprised you even showed up.
Really?
Why would that be?
I think it's pretty clear that your sister doesn't trust me very much.
Should she?
Yeah, I think she should.
I think I've proven myself.
I've saved you from getting exposed more than once.
By the way, where is Inspector Sheridan?
Does it really matter?
Uh ... it does if you hurt her.
I'm not here to hurt anybody, Paige.
I'm here to keep them from getting hurt, remember?
The fact that you know that people may die is exactly what makes you so suspicious, Agent Brody.
Kyle.
What is that?
That is a bird's-eye view of the victim just before he stepped off of the curb.
Now, we shot this with the fastest digital imaging equipment known to man or at least Homeland Security, anyway.
Now, if you look at it in normal light, it appears as though he's alone.
I throw an E.M. filter on it he's not.
What are those?
If I had to guess, I'd say the light one's a protector of some kind.
Uh ...
Protector of what?
Like some sort of Guardian Angel thing?
That's one way of putting it.
What, you don't believe in them?
You do?
Given all the scrapes that I've slipped out of, it's the only reason why I think I'm still alive.
My guess is that that's the power that the dark figure wants... people who have especially strong protectors.
That would explain why they miraculously survive something and in the next moment don't.
What?
Nothing.
So, uh ... how do we find out if that dark figure is what you think it is?
We wait for the next fire.
Interested?
There's nowhere else to turn.
Nowhere else to go.
Leave me alone.
Let go of all you know.
Don't resist us.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
Perhaps we've pushed him too far.
We have no choice.
He must join us willingly, but first must see there is no other option.
But his will is strong, even for an Elder.
Which is why he's so valuable to us.
What is it?
There may be another way, another opportunity to show him that one cannot ignore the truth forever.
Leo?
Leo?
You see, I know he can hear me.
He just doesn't wanna come.
Let me give this a try.
Leo!
Leo, you get your butt down here right now or we will summon your ass!
Nicely done.
It's not safe for me to be here.
You know that.
We'll take that risk.
What about the boys?
They're at school.
Nice try, though.
We think we found a way to help you.
Help me what?
Help you stop running.
It's a Vision Quest.
A Vision Quest.
No way.
Leo, don't you dare leave.
This is not just about you.
You are a father and somebody's husband, too.
Which is why it's too risky for me to be here.
Yeah, except you're the one that's in danger.
I'm an Elder.
I can take care of myself.
Actually, you haven't really been yourself lately.
Look, Leo, the Vision Quest helped me, and we're thinking maybe it could help you too, you know?
Won't stop the creatures.
How do you know?
You've tried everything else.
What do you have to lose...
your mind, your family, your life?
You've already lost all those things, haven't you?
Go ahead, tell me I'm wrong.
I'll go get the potion.
Okay, when I said I'd help you, this is not what I had in mind.
Just go.
I'll be okay.
Are you crazy?
How is this gonna be okay?
Because I believe in my guardian, remember?
Look, if I'm right, whoever set this fire is out there waiting for mine, so just say your spell when I'm safe and we'll see what happens.
Don't worry about me.
Yeah.
It's a little late for that!
Which way?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Homeland Security.
Paige!
Paige!
Go!
Show me what the evil sees
Even if at lightning speeds.
So it is true.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
A witch?
You're not getting his Guardian.
Now, why would I want his when I can have yours?
What's the matter, huh?
What's wrong?
I think I'm in big trouble.
No, I know, Elise, but something came up.
Yes, again, but you don't have to worry about my column.
I promise it'll -- uh, I gotta go.
What's goin' on?
Pai --oh, my god!
What happened?
Par for the course, unfortunately.
"Par for what course", and what are you doing here?
Trying to protect your sister.
I lost my Guardian Angel.
You lost your who?
Protection spirits, guides.
They're with us all the time.
Yes.
I know what Guardian Angels are.
Thank you.
Not just the hallmark thing.
It's real.
I actually saw mine.
I'm surprised we've not seen them before.
Yeah, the problem is without them, people tend to be vulnerable.
In my case, accident-prone.
Okay, I don't understand.
How did you lose your Guardian Angel?
Well, actually, we tried to lose mine, but then this demon... it was a demon, right?
Demon.
Yeah, demon comes along and takes hers instead.
Can I talk to you for a second, please, over here?
What is going on?
What's going on is that we figured out what is killing all of those innocents.
The demon is stealing their protectors.
We think it's somehow connected to this whole New Power thing.
And let me guess.
This is another one of his hunches?
No.
It's one of mine.
But you have to admit, all of his have panned out so far, right?
Yeah.
So far, they have.
So what's the next move?
Well, I'm gonna go I.D. the demon.
Have you seen the Book of Shadows?
It wasn't upstairs.
Why?
You're not gonna show him the Book of Shadows, are you?
Yeah, I am.
I trust him.
I told you that.
If it considers him a threat, it'll just zap him.
Don't worry.
Paige, you're my sister.
I have to worry.
Well, if it makes you feel better, why don't you just come with us?
I wish I could, but I can't.
Leo needs some ... serious help.
What's new?
Just promise me you're gonna be careful.
I promise.
I think I can take care of one little demon.
I meant Agent Brody.
The Book's in the kitchen.
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
No problem.
She lost her what?
Agent Brody is watching her.
She's okay.
We can't leave her alone if she lost her Guardian An -
Phoebe said she's fine.
Now, would you please focus?
What am I supposed to do?
Don't fight it.
Just let it take you to where you're supposed to be.
What if I wanna get out?
You won't be able to, not until you see what you're supposed to see.
Just sip it.
Now what?
Make yourself comfortable.
Close your eyes and just let it all go.
We gotta stop the bleeding!
He's going into shock!
I need a morphine kit!
Is there a medic out in the field?
What's going on?
What am I doing here?
Don't worry, dad.
I'm gonna help you through this.
Chris?
Chris?
Thank you.
Guess I never knew how much my Guardian Angel actually helped me, even with the little stuff.
Don't worry.
We'll find her.
I hope.
You know, maybe it'd help if you looked at the Book with me.
Feel better?
What do you mean?
Well, I assume the Book won't let anything evil touch it.
Most magical tomes don't.
What do I have to do to prove that I'm not a threat to you?
Look, I'm -
- I'm sorry.
I am.
I can't seem to trust myself right now, let alone anybody else.
Well, the Guardians did more than keep you upright.
They're your inner voice, your conscience, instincts, and without them, you tend to get a little lost.
You really do believe in them, don't you?
Yeah.
I'm a believer, all right.
Hunting the New Power for years has made me realize that there are some awful things in this world.
I just like to think that there's some good things, too, to balance it out.
Like you.
You found it.
"Celerity demon"
"Celerity demons are powerful beings who can move at the speed of light and feed off lesser demons."
Yeah, but Guardian Angels are hardly lesser demons.
Well, whether they are or they aren't, he's able to steal them.
The question is why?
Well done.
Witches have powerful Guardians...
especially a Charmed One's.
How can you be sure that she was a Charmed One?
It's the only explanation.
It's the most powerful one I possess.
Still ... it will not be enough when the Avatars come.
Perhaps not.
Unless I get the other two.
After all, legend holds that the sisters are magically connected.
Stands to reason that their Guardians should be as well.
How will you get them?
I'll just ...
listen to the one I've got.
She'll whisper to me when the others need their Guardians the most, when they're the most vulnerable.
You've taught me well, Aku.
I hope ... well enough.
Why isn't he saying anything?
So you think he's all right?
Yes.
I think he's doing exactly what he needs to be doing.
You sure you don't wanna help me out here?
No.
I'm fine right here.
Sweetie, you said it yourself.
This is something that he needs to do.
Yeah, well, I can have second thoughts, can't I?
What if something happens to him?
Well, hopefully his Guardian Angels are taking care of him.
I don't think Angels have Angels, Phoebe.
It's redundant.
You just protect ours so we can protect him.
So I don't understand.
If I'm in the past, what are you doing here?
I'm guiding you.
So you're real?
No.
But I represent something that is.
I died in your arms, dad, killed by everything that you thought was good.
I'm your root pain, okay?
And I'm gonna be sticking with you until you're ready to let me go.
How will I know when that is?
Come on.
Let's check out some parts of your life that you really need to remember.
Do I have a choice?
Hey, it's your Vision Quest.
It's up to you.
Come on.
Where are we now?
I never stopped loving you.
That feeling's what it's all about, dad.
You died fighting evil in the war, then you were reborn as a Whitelighter to fight evil again.
That led you to mom ...
love ... to all that's good.
Is that what I think it is?
To the day Wyatt was born.
Yes, it is.
Oh, it's a boy.
You mean, I got a boy?
Here you go mama.
Hi.
Hi, little guy.
What are you doing?
Look what we did.
I see.
It's a miracle.
A little miracle.
To the day when I was born.
Oh, look.
He's beautiful.
Baby Christopher, that's your brother.
Looks like we didn't lose him after all.
Do you understand now?
All the pain, all the sacrifices, it's all been for good.
That's what you're all about, dad.
That's what you've always been about.
That's what the future's about, too.
Look at your brother.
You just need to believe in that again.
Can we see her?
Go.
Your family's waiting for you.
Piper.
How you feeling?
Good.
Wait.
What?
What is it?
Leo?
Leo, wake up.
Leo!
Wake up!
Who are you?
What do you want?
I want you to see the truth, Leo.
I want you to see the real future.
We've got to do something.
There's nothing that we can do.
He's back in the Quest.
Only he can get himself out of it.
But he was just out.
Something made him go back in, something he saw.
I don't think anything can get past the crystals.
What about the New Power?
I didn't see any floating heads.
It doesn't mean they weren't there.
Why are you doing this?
...
Why are you doing this to me?
I want to get out of here.
You can't leave yet, Leo.
You're not ready.
You haven't seen what you need to see.
Why are you haunting me?
Haunting?
No.
The Creature Heads were a necessary part of guiding you to the truth.
To the truth that lies beyond Good and Evil.
To us.
Us?
Avatars.
We are ... a power.
One that offers a better way, a solution to this.
You see, Leo, the future Chris failed to mention... the death of all the people that you love, sometimes peaceful... sometimes painful... but always inevitable.
And all well before their time.
Death is a part of life.
Natural death, yes.
But not death caused by the... pointless, endless, battles...
It's not pointless.
It's necessary.
And when good wins -
Wins?
Duality is self-perpetuating.
It feeds only on itself.
That is why the battle has been raging since the dawn of time.
There is no winner.
There can be.
How?
With Good, there is always Evil.
And so the battle never ends.
Not until there's nothing left.
That is the future your fight is leading to.
Not Good nor Evil.
Only nothing.
Leo.
Who are you talking to?
I'm afraid he can't hear you.
Well, he's hearing someone.
Leo.
Leo!
What was that?
Stay here.
Why?
Just ... stay.
Guess your Guardians didn't tell you about that.
That's why I want yours...
so these kinds of things don't happen again.
Damn it!
Paige, quick!
In here!
You're gettin' to be a pain.
You can't hide in there forever!
Paige?
What the hell?
Leave him alone!
No.
There's too much at stake.
Besides, I could use the leverage.
Oh, no.
You're not a witch.
What are you?
I'm a Federal Agent.
A what?
And you know about all this?
Magic?
Demons?
I'm getting a quick education.
It won't do you much good.
I only need you long enough for the witches to attempt a rescue.
And since they're obviously otherwise occupied and down a guardian, they won't come all at once.
Someone will get left behind.
And that's when I'll attack.
I'm just curious.
What do you want with all these Guardians if you don't mind me asking.
I don't want them.
I need them.
Worried about the New Power, are we?
You know about the Avatars?
Avatars?
So that's what they're called?
Yes, that's what they're called.
And I, for one, won't be cast aside by them when the time comes for them to take power.
Which is why I need more Guardians, which is the only reason I'm keeping you alive.
So what are you going to do if you find him?
What do you mean, what am I going to do?
I'm going to save him.
We are going to save him.
But it's a trap.
The demon said so himself.
He just took him for leverage.
So we're just going to let him get killed?
He's not going to kill him, okay?
He needs him alive.
Yeah, but for how long?
Piper, help me out.
I'm with Phoebe here.
Sarpedon's really powerful, and he's got all those Guardians.
Yeah, including mine.
And that's why you're not thinking straight!
Paige, we can't go after him.
It's ridiculous.
Yeah?
Well, I'm not just going to let him rot, either.
I'll go get him myself.
Okay, so now that we know where they are, all we have to do is mix up a new vanquishing potion and get Paige's spell.
Yeah, but that would mean we would have to go to the Book, which is in the kitchen and which entails us going downstairs away from the crystals, which means the demon could slice and dice us.
True, but for all we know, the demon could already have Paige.
Us getting killed doesn't change that.
Besides, I can't leave Leo.
Okay, I know this is really hard for you, Piper, but there's nothing that we can do to help Leo.
He's got to fight this fight on his own.
But we can help Paige.
All right.
Let's just make it fast.
Okay.
Remember, if the demon attacks, grab the amulet.
Oh, sure, yeah.
No problem.
Phoebe!
Next.
Hey!
Where's your amulet?
No!
Leo.
What do you mean this is the end?
The end of what?
The end of the battle between Good and Evil, its outcome... mutual destruction, and the eternal void that necessarily follows.
How is this possible?
I'm afraid it's unavoidable.
A flawed design.
There is, however, another way, a better way.
That is what we represent, Leo.
But we'll need your help to implement it.
And The Charmed Ones, of course, when they're ready.
What way is that?
Utopia.
A world where good and evil no longer exist, where the battle is behind you, behind everyone.
A world where you and Piper no longer have to suffer through the obstacles that have kept you apart.
What's the catch?
Only the courage to change.
Unless it's already too late.
Piper.
She's not here, Leo.
I'm afraid there isn't much time.
Piper?
Piper!
Why did you do this?
We didn't do this, Leo, evil did.
It might not be too late, though, to reverse it if you'll join us.
You can save them?
We can save everyone, Leo, with your help.
So be it.
Welcome to the fold.
What do I do next?
Heal them.
I can't heal them, they're dead.
You're an Avatar now, Leo.
You have all you need.
You have the powers.
Leo?
Piper.
You're back.
I thought I was Dead?
Where did you get that?
Oh, from the demon, I guess.
What, so that's it?
It's over?
Is it?
I've never seen you heal anyone like that, Leo.
Did something happen to you?
What do you mean?
In the Vision Quest, you seemed like you were in pain.
Yeah.
Well ... it's something I had to go through, I guess, to see the truth.
I can't believe she bought it she got too close and she caught it had a point, but she forgot it
how long is she gonna be around?
And how long do we have to watch her dumb it down?
'Cause when it's cheap, it fades fast and how long does she think it's gonna last?
You're gonna fall behind me you're gonna cry and beg for mercy 'cause you're not ready, baby and you got nothing on me
and you got nothing on me and you got nothing on me
Give it up for San Francisco's very own, The Donnas!
Thanks for getting Rex to do that sound check.
They sounded great.
Yeah.
Actually, I forgot to do that.
What?
I was very busy trying to save your husband.
All right.
Down girl.
Easy.
Don't worry about it.
I guess I get a little testy when someone kills me, you know.
Oh, come on.
We weren't killed, we were just maimed.
Leo can't heal the dead.
Hey, ladies.
Sorry I'm late.
Ooh, you guys look great for being recently deceased.
We weren't dead.
Ah, forget it.
Oh, hey--
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
My bad.
I see you got your Angel back.
Thank God.
No pun intended.
What about Agent Brody?
Who?
All right.
Kyle.
You know, just because we almost got him killed doesn't mean we have to trust him.
Ah, come on now.
Enough of this already.
Everything turned out fine, like it always does.
Well, almost always does.
Except for the Avatars.
Kyle said that's what the demon called the New Power.
Doesn't ring any bells.
Well, well, well, look at you.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
It's good to be back.
Believe me.
No more voices, floating heads, guilt trips?
Nope.
Nothing.
Ever hear of the Avatars?
Avatars?
Why?
I guess they could be the big bad everyone's worried about.
I will look into it.
But first, a toast to being back together.
New beginnings.
I will drink to that.
We have to get you away from the building.
Yeah, but my stuff!
Paige, there you are.
- Anyone got hurt?
- Not as far as I can tell.
- Have you seen Agent Brody yet?
- What are we doing here?
He said for us to meet him here.
He needed to talk to us about something important.
Yeah, but it's a fire.
- So?
- So we don't do fires.
Firemen do fires.
We do fireballs.
He said it was something connected to this
- New Power thing he's talking about.
- Well, we're not Brody's Angels.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm stressed.
It's my first week back at work, and I have a lot of catching up to do.
Follow me.
Keep an eye on the third floor.
Wait.
Why?
Somebody's trapped.
If I'm right, he's gonna jump and not get hurt.
- How do you know?
- Just a hunch.
Just a hunch, huh, Agent Brody?
- Kyle.
- Whatever.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but we don't really know you.
I know you were right about the New Power thing, but...
On the ledge, third floor!
Jumper!
Come on, bring it down!
Hey, get the ladder over here!
Let me protect you.
Are you all right?
Come on.
Whoa.
Okay, how did you know that?
That's the fourth person it's happened to in the last month.
If the pattern holds, he's about to die.
- Pattern?
What pattern?
- What?
All right, guys, stay on the survivor.
- Keep recording!
- Copy that.
Oh, God, is he talking to that helicopter?
He's really cool.
Yes, ma'am.
I understand that.
I'm okay.
The EMT needs to check you out first.
Down there.
Sir!
No...
Stop.
Watch for the...
- Who are you?
- A thief.
Looks like you're on your own.
No, no, no, wait!
Damn it!
Ten-four, we'll update it.
Agent 250 at dispatch.
We need you to return...
Yeah.
Well, take care of it.
I still don't understand how he knew this was gonna happen.
I wanna know why we couldn't stop it.
Stop what?
A man jumped out of a burning building only to get hit by a truck?
- What's the connection there?
- I'm hoping Kyle knows.
Okay, you know, can we call him Agent Brody until we can trust him?
I trust him.
- Are you okay?
- No.
I just wish I knew why this keeps happening.
- Something about a pattern?
- Every time something unusual happens,
I investigate.
The more unusual, the more it tends to lead towards this New Power.
- This New Power have a name?
- Don't know.
Wanna walk?
You think that whole thing's what's killing these innocents?
I don't think they're literally running them down.
I do think that they're doing something to cause them to be killed.
- What kind of something?
- I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's got to do with taking power.
- It's what they're all about.
- Powers?
Innocents don't have powers.
If they did, they wouldn't need us.
All I know is things this unusual don't just happen over and over.
- Something's going on.
- Another hunch?
Don't knock 'em, Phoebe.
My hunches led me to you.
Look, I can guarantee you this is not gonna be the last person to miraculously escape a fire, only to die moments later.
If you guys wanna help me figure this one out you know where to find me.
What do you think?
I think he's got some style.
How dare you summon me.
You said to call if I ever wanted to challenge you.
You think you are ready to challenge me?
The last time you tried it, I spared your life.
This time I may not be so merciful.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
You've been around humans too long.
What makes you think you're ready?
Like you said, I've been around humans.
Shall we?
Talk to me.
You've come far... quickly.
Not far enough.
I need more!
- More what?
- More guardians.
I steal the ones who help save their humans so that they can help me instead.
- All this just to defeat me?
- No.
So I can protect myself from the threat you taught us was coming.
Nothing can protect you from that.
- Unless you go into hiding until...
- I won't hide!
If demons don't stand up to them, who will?
I just need more.
Could you do me a favour?
Call Rex and have them do a sound check before the show.
I don't wanna mess up The Donna's release party.
- It's gonna be packed.
- Are you listening to me?
Yeah, yeah, Brody, fires, hunches.
I got my own problems.
- Are you sure Enola graduated already?
- Yeah, I'm positive.
Why?
- She might be the one who can save Leo.
- What are you talking about?
She helped you see your future with a vision quest.
Gave you something to look forward to.
Life after demons.
- That's what Leo needs.
- There's no guarantees
Leo would see that.
A vision quest can take you anywhere, and sometimes it can be dangerous.
Couldn't be more dangerous than what he's going through now, if that New Power is still after him.
A vision quest won't change that.
No, but it may show him a way to fight them.
Phoebe, he's alone, and he's scared, and he's forgotten who he is.
I'm afraid if I can't help him, my children are gonna lose their father.
- It's still risky.
- But it's a risk I'm willing to take.
What are you doing?
I'm making the vision quest potion.
She showed me how to do it.
- What about Brody?
- Paige can take care of Brody.
I think she likes taking care of Brody, if you know what I'm talking about.
And besides, this... is family.
Nobody's home.
You're quite the liar.
Sorry.
I didn't realise it was you.
Actually, I'm surprised you even showed up.
Really?
Why would that be?
It's pretty clear your sister doesn't trust me very much.
- Should she?
- I think she should.
I've proven myself.
I've saved you from getting exposed more than once.
By the way, where is Inspector Sheridan?
Come on, does it really matter?
It does if you hurt her.
I'm not here to hurt anybody, Paige.
I'm here to keep them from getting hurt.
The fact that you know that people may die is exactly what makes you so suspicious, Agent Brody.
Kyle.
What is that?
That is a bird's-eye view of the victim just before he stepped off the kerb.
We shot this with the fastest digital imaging equipment known to man.
Or at least Homeland Security.
If you look at it in normal light, it appears as though he's alone.
Throw an EM filter on it he's not.
What are those?
If I had to guess, I'd say the light one's a protector of some kind.
Protector?
Like some sort of guardian angel thing?
That's one way of putting it.
- What, you don't believe in them?
- You do?
Given all the scrapes that I've slipped out of, it's the only reason I think I'm still alive.
My guess is that's the power the dark figure wants.
People have especially strong protectors.
It'd explain why they miraculously survive something and, the next moment, don't.
- What?
- Nothing.
So...
How do we find out if that dark figure is what you think it is?
We wait for the next fire.
Interested?
There's nowhere else to turn.
- Nowhere else to go.
- Leave me alone!
Let go of all you know.
Don't resist.
Don't resist us.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
- Perhaps we've pushed him too far.
- We have no choice.
He must join us willingly.
But first must see there's no other option.
- His will is strong, even for an Elder.
- Which is why he's so valuable to us.
What is it?
There may be another way.
Another opportunity to show him that one cannot ignore the truth forever.
Leo?
Leo?
You see, I know he can hear me.
He just doesn't wanna come.
Let me give this a try.
Leo!
Leo, you get your butt down here right now, or we will summon your ass!
Nicely done.
It's not safe for me to be here, you know.
- We'll take that risk.
- What about the boys?
At school.
Nice try though.
- We found a way to help you.
- Help me what?
- Help you stop running.
- It's a vision quest.
A vision quest?
No way.
Leo, don't you dare leave.
This is not just about you.
You are a father and somebody's husband.
Which is why it's risky for me to be here.
Except you're the one in danger.
I'm an Elder.
I can take care of myself.
Actually, you haven't been yourself lately.
The vision quest helped me.
- Maybe it could help you too.
- It won't stop the creatures.
How do you know?
You tried everything else.
What do you have to lose?
Your mind, your family, your life.
You've already lost those, haven't you?
Go ahead, tell me I'm wrong.
I'll go get the potion.
Okay, when I said I'd help you, this is not what I had in mind.
- Just go.
I'll be okay.
- You crazy?
How's this gonna be okay?
I believe in my guardians.
If I'm right, whoever set this fire is out there.
Say your spell, and we'll see what happens.
- Don't worry about me.
- It's a little late for that.
Which way?
Trust us.
You all right?
- It's all right.
Homeland Security.
- You sure?
Paige?
Paige!
Come on...
Show me what the evil sees even if at lightning speed
- So it is true.
- Well, well, well.
What have we here... a witch?
You're not getting his guardian.
Now why would I want his, when I can have yours?
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
I think I'm in big trouble.
No, I know, Elise, but something came up.
Yes, again, but you don't have to worry about my column.
I promise it'll...
I gotta go.
Wha...?
Paige?
What's going on?
Pa...
Oh, my God, what happened?
- Par for the course, unfortunately.
- Par for what course?
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to protect your sister.
- I lost my guardian angel.
- You lost your who?
Protection spirits, guides.
They're with us all the time.
I know what guardian angels are.
Not just the Hallmark thing.
It's real.
I saw mine.
- Surprised we'd not seen them before.
- The problem is, without them,
- people tend to be vulnerable.
- In my case, accident-prone.
I don't understand.
How did you lose your guardian angel?
We were trying to lose mine,
- but then this demon...
Demon, right?
- Demon.
Demon comes along and takes hers instead.
Can I talk to you for a second, please, over here?
What is going on?
We figured out what is killing all of those innocents.
The demon's stealing their protectors.
It's connected to this New Power thing.
- This is another of his hunches?
- No, it's one of mine.
But you have to admit, all of his have panned out so far, right?
Yeah, so far they have.
So what's the next move?
I'm gonna ID the demon.
Seen the Book of Shadows?
- It wasn't upstairs.
- You're not gonna show him the Book?
Yeah, I am.
I trust him.
I told you that.
Look, if it considers him a threat, it'll just zap him.
Don't worry.
Paige, you're my sister.
I have to worry.
Well, if it makes you feel better, come with us.
I wish I could, but I can't.
Leo needs some serious help.
- What's new?
- Promise me you're gonna be careful.
Promise.
I think I can take care of one little demon.
I meant Agent Brody.
The Book's in the kitchen.
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
- No problem.
- Yeah...
- She lost her what?
- Brody's watching her.
She's okay.
We can't leave her alone if she lost...
Phoebe said she's fine.
Now, please focus.
- What am I supposed to do?
- Don't fight it.
Let it take you where you're supposed to be.
- What if I want out?
- You won't be able to.
Not until you see what you're supposed to see.
Just sip it.
- Now what?
- Make yourself comfortable.
Close your eyes and just let it all go.
Wyatt!
We've gotta stop the bleeding.
He's going into shock.
I need a morphine kit!
Is there a medic out in the field?
What's going on?
What am I doing here?
Don't worry, Dad.
I'm gonna help you through this.
Chris?
Chris?
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Guess I never knew how much my guardian angel actually helped me,
- even with the little stuff.
- Don't worry, we'll find her.
I hope.
You know, maybe it'd help if you looked at the Book with me.
- Feel better?
- What do you mean?
I assume the Book won't let anything evil touch it.
Most magical tomes don't.
What do I have to do to prove I'm not a threat to you?
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry.
I am.
I can't seem to trust myself right now, let alone anybody else.
Well, guardians do more than keep you upright.
I mean, they're your inner voice, your conscience, instincts.
And without them, you tend to get a little lost.
You really do believe in them, don't you?
Yeah.
I'm a believer, all right.
Hunting the New Power for years has made me realise there's some awful things in this world.
I'd just like to think there's some good things too, to balance it out.
Like you.
You found it!
"Celerity demons are powerful beings who can move at the speed of light and feed off lesser demons."
Yeah, but guardian angels are hardly lesser demons.
Well, whether they are or they aren't, he's able to steal them.
The question is, why?
Well done.
Witches have powerful guardians especially a Charmed One's.
How can you be sure that she was a Charmed One?
It's the only explanation.
It's the most powerful one I possess.
Still, it will not be enough when the Avatars come.
Perhaps not.
Unless I get the other two.
Legend holds the sisters are magically connected.
It stands to reason their guardians should be as well.
- How will you get them?
- I'll just listen to the one I've got.
She'll whisper to me when the others need their guardians most.
When they're the most vulnerable.
You've taught me well, Aku.
I hope... well enough.
Why isn't he saying anything?
Do you think he's all right?
Yes, I think he's doing exactly what he needs to be doing.
Sure you don't wanna help me out here?
No, I'm fine right here.
Sweetie, you said it yourself.
This is something that he needs to do.
I can have second thoughts, can't I?
What if something happens to him?
Hopefully, his angels are taking care of him.
I don't think angels have angels, Phoebe.
It's redundant.
You just protect ours so we can protect him.
I don't understand.
If I'm in the past, what are you doing here?
I'm guiding you.
So you're real?
No.
But I represent something that is.
I died in your arms, Dad.
Killed by everything that you thought was good.
I'm your root pain, okay?
I'm gonna be sticking with you until you're ready to let me go.
How will I know when that is?
Come on, let's check out parts of your life you really need to remember.
Do I have a choice?
Hey, it's your vision quest.
It's up to you.
Come on.
Where are we now?
I never stopped loving you.
That feeling's what it's all about, Dad.
You died fighting evil in the war.
You were reborn as a Whitelighter to fight evil.
That led you to Mom, love, to all that's good.
Is that what I think it is?
- To the day Wyatt was born.
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, it's a boy.
- I got a boy?
- Here you go, Mama.
- Hi.
Hi, little guy, what are you doing?
Look what we did!
I see.
It's a miracle.
A little miracle.
To the day when I was born.
Oh, look, he's beautiful.
Baby Christopher.
That's your brother.
Looks like we didn't lose him after all.
Do you understand now?
All the pain, all the sacrifices.
It's all been for good.
That's what you're all about, Dad.
That's what you've always been about.
That's what the future's about too.
- Look at your brother!
- You need to believe in that again.
Can we see her?
Go.
Your family's waiting for you.
- Piper...
- Hey, how you feeling?
Good.
What?
What is it?
Leo.
Leo, wake up.
Leo!
Wake up!
Who are you?
What do you want?
I want you to see the truth, Leo.
I want you to see the real future.
- We gotta do something.
- There's nothing we can do.
He's back in the quest.
Only he can get himself out.
He was out.
Something made him go back in.
Something he saw.
I don't think anything can get past crystals.
- The New Power?
- I didn't see floating heads.
- Doesn't mean they weren't there.
- Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this to me?
I wanna get out of here.
You can't leave yet, Leo.
You're not ready.
You haven't seen what you need to see.
- Why are you haunting me?
- Haunting?
No, the creature heads were a necessary part of guiding you to the truth.
To the truth that lies beyond good and evil.
- To us.
- Us?
Avatars.
We are a power.
One that offers a better way.
A solution to this.
You see, the future Chris failed to mention the death of all the people that you love.
Sometimes peaceful sometimes painful but always inevitable.
And all well before their time.
Death is a part of life.
Natural death, yes.
But not death caused by the pointless, endless battles between good and evil.
It's not pointless, it's necessary.
And when good wins...
Wins?
Duality is self-perpetuating.
It feeds only on itself.
That is why the battle has been raging since the dawn of time.
There is no winner.
- There can be.
- How?
With good there is always evil.
And so the battle never ends.
Not until there's nothing left.
That is the future your fight is leading to.
Not good nor evil only nothing.
No!
- Leo, who are you talking to?
- Piper, he can't hear you.
Well, he's hearing someone.
Leo.
Leo!
What was that?
- Stay here.
- Why?
Just stay.
Guess your guardians didn't tell you about that.
That's why I want yours.
So these kinds of things don't happen again.
- Damn it!
- Paige, quick!
In here!
You're getting to be a pain.
- You can't hide in there forever.
- Paige?
What the hell?
Leave him alone!
No.
There's too much at stake.
Besides, I could use the leverage.
Oh, no!
You're not a witch.
What are you?
I'm a federal agent.
A what?
And you know about all this?
Magic, demons?
I'm getting a quick education.
It won't do you much good.
I only need you long enough for the witches to attempt a rescue.
Since they're otherwise occupied and down a guardian, they won't come all at once.
Someone will get left behind.
And that's when I'll attack.
I'm just curious what do you want with these guardians, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't want them.
I need them.
Worried about the New Power, are we?
You know about the Avatars?
Avatars?
So that's what they're called?
Yes, that's what they're called.
I won't be cast aside by them when the time comes for them to take power, which is why I need more guardians, which is the only reason I'm keeping you alive.
So, what are you gonna do if you find him?
What do you mean, "What am I gonna do?"
I'm gonna save him.
We're gonna save him.
It's a trap.
The demon said so.
- He took him for leverage.
- We're gonna let him get killed?
He's not gonna kill him, okay?
He needs him alive.
Yeah, but for how long?
Piper, help me out.
I'm with Phoebe here.
Sarpedon's powerful.
He has all those guardians.
Yeah, including mine.
That's why you're not thinking straight.
We can't go after him.
It's ridiculous.
Yeah?
Well, I'm not gonna let him rot.
- I'll go get him myself.
- Wha?
Pa...
Kyle?
Kyle?
Kyle?
Kyle?
Pai...
Now we know where they are.
All we have to do is mix up a new vanquishing potion and get Paige's spell.
But that'd mean we'd have to go to the Book, which is in the kitchen, which entails us going downstairs, away from the crystals, which means the demon could slice and dice us.
True, but for all we know the demon could already have Paige.
Us getting killed doesn't change that.
I can't leave Leo.
I know this is really hard for you, Piper.
But there's nothing that we can do to help Leo.
He's gotta fight this fight on his own.
But we can help Paige.
All right, let's just make it fast.
Okay.
Remember, if the demon attacks, grab the amulet.
Oh, sure, yeah, no problem.
Phoebe!
Next.
Hey!
Where's your amulet?
No!
Leo!
What do you mean, this is the end?
The end of what?
The end of the battle between good and evil.
Its outcome.
Mutual destruction.
And the eternal void that necessarily follows.
How is this possible?
I'm afraid it's unavoidable.
A... flawed design.
There is, however, another way.
A better way.
That is what we represent, Leo.
But we'll need your help to implement.
And the Charmed Ones, of course, when they're ready.
What way is that?
Utopia.
A world where good and evil no longer exist.
Where the battle is behind you, behind everyone.
A world where you and Piper no longer have to suffer through the obstacles that have kept you apart.
What's the catch?
Only the courage to change.
Unless it's already too late.
Piper.
She's not here, Leo.
I'm afraid there isn't much time.
Piper!
Piper!
No.
Why did you do this?
We didn't do this, Leo.
Evil did.
It might not be too late, though, to reverse it.
If you'll join us.
You can save them?
We can save everyone, Leo.
With your help.
So be it.
Welcome to the fold.
What do I do next?
Heal them.
I can't heal them.
They're dead.
You're an Avatar now, Leo.
You have all you need.
You have the powers.
Leo?
- Piper.
- You're back.
- I thought I was...
- Dead?
- Where did you get that?
- From the demon, I guess.
Wait, so that's it?
It's over?
Is it?
I've never seen you heal anyone like that, Leo.
- Did something happen to you?
- What do you mean?
In the vision quest, you seemed like you were in pain.
Yeah, well, something I had to go through, I guess to see the truth.
Give it up for San Francisco's very own, The Donnas!
Thanks for getting Rex to do that sound check.
- They sounded great.
- Actually, I forgot to do that.
What?
I was very busy trying to save your husband.
Down, girl.
Easy.
Don't worry about it.
I guess I get a little testy when someone kills me, you know.
Oh, come on, we weren't killed.
We were just maimed.
Leo can't heal the dead.
Hey, ladies.
Sorry I'm late.
You guys look great for being recently deceased.
We weren't dead!
Forget it.
Oh, hey!
Sorry!
God, I'm sorry, my bad.
I see you got your angel back.
Thank God.
No pun intended.
- What about Agent Brody?
- Who?
All right, Kyle.
Just 'cause we almost got him killed doesn't mean we have to trust him.
Oh, come on, now.
Enough of this already.
Everything turned out fine, like it always does.
Well, almost always does.
Except for the Avatars.
Kyle said that that's what the demon called the New Power.
Doesn't ring any bells.
Well, well, well, look at you.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
It's good to be back, believe me.
No voices, floating heads, guilt trips?
Nope, nothing.
You ever hear of the Avatars?
Avatars?
Why?
They could be the big bad everyone's worried about.
I will look into it.
But first, a toast to being back together.
- New beginnings.
- I will drink to that.
Time to stop now.
Off you go.
Relax, go dancing with your husband.
See you tomorrow...
Ciao...
Bye...
Thank you.
It's taken, sorry.
Good, isn't it?
Yes.
They say 'a hamburger's a hamburger.
But these are the best.
-Really?
Yes. I've been everywhere, had them everywhere.
Maybe it's because we're at home.
Everything is always better at home.
You know what else is good?
What?
-Coffee.
Milk, sugar?
Lovely, both please.
Will you keep an eye on her?
Yes, that sounds like a good idea.
Stop by and we'll go over it all.
That's fine.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
Galina... I have to go out.
Will you take over?
See you later.
Oh, how sweet.
-Look at the little feet.
I hope it still fits.
She has her father's feet.
Do you want to?
-Yes.
Careful...
I'll take her.
She needs changing.
What a smelly little sweetie.
The baby's fantastic.
One smile from her makes my day lt's incredible, and all the clichés are true.
I wanted to ask... do you remember the name of that little hotel in Portugal?
I want to surprise José, but can't find it on the net.
The one by the sea.
There are so many.
-l know, but...
With that family in the kitchen and the little bay...
Where we fooled around all day.
You haven't forgotten.
-l'm afraid I have.
It was great seeing you again.
Thanks.
Bye...
Stop by any time.
Hello...
Hello...
Martje Portegies...
-Loe de Koning...
Great coffee...
Yes...
This way.
You'd be driving the delivery van.
-l thought so.
That one. I don't know if you're familiar with it.
I usually go south.
Spain, Portugal, Morocco.
Okay.
High cubes, ferry transport, sometimes combis.
A bit bigger than this then.
-Yes.
Why do you want to work here?
-Because of the hamburgers.
Sorry about the coffee.
Won't we be too boring for you?
We have steady customers, a short route.
No further than Hardewijk.
-Hardewijk, great.
The Dolfinarium.
I've been driving south for 1 2 years.
It's a lovely route.
But I want to spend more time at home.
For the children?
-No children.
Not yet.
I'm sorry.
Let's leave it at that.
I'll get in touch as soon as possible.
Okay.
Goodbye for now.
Goodbye for now.
I'd like to... introduce you to someone.
This is your new colleague, Loe de Koning.
He has the impossible task of replacing Guus.
Bye.
Loe, can you dance?
-Can I dance?
Wait a minute.
I want to say something.
Where's my vodka?
Guus, thank you for everything.
And all the best.
That was for you.
Now, Loe...
Before you show us how well you can dance... I want to welcome you to your new job.
This is a good business with beautiful people.
But most important:
Martje is the best boss in the world.
He's terribly thirsty.
What do you want?
-What do you have?
Whatever you want.
-Everything.
Go ahead.
-Here?
Cola, cassis, beer, breezer, water, white wine... cola. I already said that.
-Whisky.
Whisky?
Yuck.
-You've never had a good one.
Good whisky is smooth.
I bet you'd like it.
Make it a beer.
Going good, isn't it?
He's nice.
A nice man.
-Who, Guus?
Guus is great.
We'll miss him.
-l'm talking about Loe.
Loe is a nice man.
-He's a good dancer, yes.
You're single, you're lovely.
You should take Loe.
He wants you, he's yours.
Loe is ours.
I guess they've had enough of me.
Let's agree to one thing:
when we dance, I lead.
Okay?
Deal?
-Yes.
Ouch, my hand.
I should've worn shoes more suitable for dancing.
Or picked another dancing partner.
I need a drink.
Come on, Martje.
-Sorry. lt was great fun.
Have a nice weekend everyone.
See you all on Monday.
I'll lend a hand.
-No, that's okay.
I'll manage.
Where does that bench go?
-ln the boiler room.
Over there, past those machines.
Okay.
No, we can't.
-Sure we can.
No.
Leave it.
I'll do it tomorrow.
Come on, time to go.
I'm the boss.
I decide what happens here.
See you on Monday.
You'll see more trousers than jackets, for they get dirty sooner.
My men must be faultless and impeccable.
A dirty pilot is a dreadful sight.
We have more than 1 1 2 officers, a cabin crew of 350... and 500 ground personnel.
Plus the support crew.
The laundry process...
-Washing and dry-cleaning are best.
I can submit a quote and offer a trial run of 200 uniforms.
Pick-up tomorrow, ready in ten days.
-Ten days?
Okay, in a week.
-Deal.
If all goes well, an annual contract with the possibility of an extension.
You'll have the quote within a week.
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
Loe, my office, please.
I was wondering if you... if you still...
Yes.
Here, at work?
-lf the boss doesn't mind.
I'm the boss.
Martje...
But I don't know if you want me.
I do.
But...
Trust me.
Do you trust me?
What's wrong?
-Nothing.
My hand caught on something.
Jesus...
-Get out.
Jesus, I got a fright.
Sorry.
Get out.
You could've said something.
I mean... then I'd have known.
You mean, so you could back off?
-No.
If you know, it doesn't matter.
-Don't lie.
Of course it matters.
Do you think you're the first to back off?
I'm still here, aren't I?
Yes, but why?
Bugger off.
Now you know.
Now you know, it doesn't matter, does it?
Hey, Loe, want to dance?
Yes, wash it again.
-l've washed it three times.
What happened?
He's gone.
Good afternoon.
My prosthesis is leaking.
Look, here.
-Yes, I see it.
I think you'll need a new one.
Have you ever thought of an adhesive prosthesis?
It attaches directly to the skin.
You hardly notice it.
It has a ventilating strip and moves with the body, like a real breast.
No, I'll stick to this kind.
Sure?
-Yes.
Okay, I'll order it.
I have a spare for you here.
Here you are.
You can fit it around the corner there.
Fine, that's everything then.
Would you like a nipple on it?
I have them in rust and chocolate brown.
No, thank you.
-Okay, bye.
Keys, for the boiler room.
-lt's very hot in there.
It'll teach him a lesson.
-But Loe...
He's a bad man and you're a good boss.
He has to learn who's boss here.
Martje...
We're here for you if you need us.
Martje...
Yes...
They put me in the boiler room.
I'm coming.
Come on, Martje.
-Okay.
Dammit Martje, let me out.
I'll go mad in here.
Come on, open the door.
I'm melting in here.
Martje, open the door.
I want you to agree not to tell anyone what happened.
Nothing happened.
Open the door.
-You assaulted me.
Assaulted?
Leave it, Martje.
You know nothing happened.
That's not what the girls think.
-Leave it, nothing happened.
Nobody will believe you.
-Come on, let me out.
Okay, but give me three minutes... to get away, so we don't have to see each other again.
Say that nothing happened.
Open the door. I want to go home.
-Three minutes.
Say I didn't do anything or I'm not going anywhere.
Say I didn't do anything.
Loe...
-l didn't do anything.
Say that nothing happened or I'm going straight back in there.
You know nothing happened.
We kissed, that's all.
You didn't tell me you only had one boob... and I was startled.
Big deal.
A friend of mine took a woman home, turned out to be a man.
He had no boobs at all.
That's bad.
I was lucky.
Jesus...
Open the door.
Martje, open the door.
Good morning...
Girls, I have something to say.
I just want to tell you that he's gone.
Your action gave him a good fright.
Okay, the matter is closed.
I don't want to hear about it again.
Let's get to work.
Hey...
You okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.
Let's see, this is quite difficult.
It must be perfect.
-Okay, I'll try.
Who's that?
What's she doing here?
She's here to work.
Said you wouldn't mind if she brought her baby.
I don't know her.
is this yours?
Who are you?
How did you get here?
Do you understand?
Do you know her?
Did you let her in?
No.
-Can you understand her?
No, she's Russian, I'm Croatian.
Galina, she's Russian.
-l know.
Come here.
-Okay.
How old is it?
Are you sure she understands you?
It's a newborn, you can't just leave it there.
And you should be home in bed, not working.
Stop that.
You don't work here.
Take your baby and go home.
Go...
What's she saying?
-She wants to work here.
She says everyone knows you're a good boss.
(in Dutch) You're a good boss.
I need a good boss.
Please.
Can I see your papers?
Sorry, I don't work with illegals.
You need a residence permit.
Do you know what that is?
What am I to do with a baby here?
And an illegal.
Quiet, you.
Quiet...
Don't cry.
Yes, I was just about to phone.
We have a problem with transport.
I'm terribly sorry.
Certainly.
Once we're moving again, you'll be first.
Yes, that's fine.
Of course.
I'm mailing the quote today.
No change there.
It'll all be delivered on Monday.
Okay, don't mention it.
Bye.
What lungs.
Zoya, office, please.
We have a good name.
It's a permanent contract, 1 3th month.
Do you know where l can find a new driver then?
Thanks, bye.
God, how clumsy.
Here...
You don't hold a baby like that.
is it a boy or a girl?
A boy.
What's your name little guy?
The baby.
'The baby' isn't a name.
Every baby has a name.
-His is 'the baby'.
What's his father's name?
-Don't know.
You must know who his father is.
That baby must have a name.
He can only stay here if you give him a name.
You think of one.
-Sorry?
You think of one.
Martje, what's happening tomorrow?
-No, no...
No, it's broken.
Girls, we're delivering again tomorrow.
You can all go home now.
Okay, have a nice evening.
-You too.
Come here, bitch.
I didn't mean that.
You're fantastic, really.
You really are.
Open the door then I can help you.
The first time I saw you you were wearing a pink top.
Remember that pink top?
You looked good in it.
Martje... I dreamt last night that we went away together.
Somewhere south.
To a beach with shells.
You and me, a sunset.
We made a fire.
Martje...
You know what I'd really like?
To start over again.
No mistakes this time.
Do you hear me?
I can't stay in here, Martje.
You know I can't.
Think of yourself.
You have to let me out. i need something to drink.
Martje, get the key and open the door.
I'll wait three minutes or four, or five.
Whatever it takes.
I'll walk right out without looking round.
Get the key and let me out.
You'll never see me again.
You're all alone.
Just a minute, Loe.
The baby's crying.
You're thirsty.
Drink it all up.
That's enough.
We'll have a nice sleep.
A little sleep. I'm right here.
Loe?
I fell asleep, sorry.
Martje...
Come on, open the door.
is Zoya in yet?
-No, I've not seen her.
Just forgot.
-You don't forget a baby.
Only once.
-Not even once, Zoya.
He's not a doll.
You have to care for him.
Some would kill to have a child and you just forget him.
Do you know how fast a baby dehydrates?
He's still alive.
Do you love your baby?
Right, a mother has to love her child.
She doesn't have to, she just does.
You're much too young to have a baby.
Shall I trade him?
For a bike?
I'd rather have a bike.
You don't know what you are saying.
Here, for you.
You can have him.
We're waiting for the driver.
No washing, no work.
I'll take care of it.
Everything'll be fine.
Martje, stop.
You're not a driver.
You have to wait for the real one.
I couldn't find one, so I'll have to drive for now.
You can't. lt's dangerous.
There'll be an accident.
Get off...
Go away...
Get out of the way, move aside.
I have to think of the business.
We'll lose our customers.
Certainly if they see you like this.
Just look at yourself.
I'll ask Guus to drive.
Listen, come inside.
You must look after yourself.
Come on.
Guus...
Hello, ladies... I'm back.
Hello.
-l'll be right with you.
I'm Loe's wife.
Loe's wife?
-Yes.
Have a seat.
-Thank you.
I didn't notice a thing.
He didn't act strange.
He just didn't show up.
I had to phone for a replacement.
I didn't know he was married or I would have...
Loe wouldn't stay away two nights without telling me.
I don't understand.
He's always so thoughtful.
And he was happy about the new job.
It meant he'd be home more.
The police won't help.
They say it's quite common.
But Loe just isn't like that.
How are the children taking it?
-We don't have any children.
That's good.
I mean now, with everything...
-Sorry.
Loe seemed like a man who'd want children.
Will you please let me know if you hear anything?
Of course, immediately.
But I'm afraid... lt's okay.
Are you okay?
-Yes, fine.
Everything'll be fine.
Martje, let me out... I want...
Put your thing in a hole.
And flap it about. I know what you want.
Jezus, I want you, nobody else...
Do you say that to all your women?
How many are there actually?
You're the only one.
-l spoke to Dorien, Loe.
Your wife, in case you've forgotten.
Son of a bitch...
Bastard... I didn't forget.
I should have told you...
Dorien and me, that's already two.
Two what?
-Victims.
How many more are there?
You're the only one who counts, Martje.
Bullshit.
I didn't want to hurt her.
Bastard.
Dorien and I were young.
It was different with you.
With you, from the very first...
Let me out, Martje.
I can't take any more.
I'm thirsty.
Let me be near you.
May I be with you?
I really want to be with you.
Martje?
Yes?
What are you wearing?
My pink top... and a skirt.
You're beautiful...
Gorgeous.
I want to look at you.
Can I look at you?
Martje...
Let's take the truck and go away together.
Where do you want to go?
Somewhere south.
-Yes.
We go.
Take your stuff.
We'll go.
Yes.
Okay...
Ms Portegies, would you like to fit it?
I've reconsidered.
I'd like the adhesive one.
The Comfort Contact?
-Yes.
That's fine.
I'll take this one back then.
If I order it now, it'll be in tomorrow.
Not sooner?
-No.
Shall I?
-Yes, please.
All right, then.
-With nipple, please.
Okay.
That looks good.
-Not good enough.
It's too much work.
Look, here and here...
We need more time.
-We don't have it.
Once I have the contract we can hire more people.
My sister is a good worker.
Clean...
Once the order is in, you can bring the whole family.
I talked to him.
Good.
See, it's not difficult.
It is difficult.
He's a baby now.
But he'll grow.
What do I say when he's 1 8?
You'll know.
-No, I won't 'know'.
When I was little I wanted to be a good person.
My father said it was easy But he forgot... that other people make us beasts.
That's enough.
-You know I'm right.
I know what happened.
To you.
With that man.
Farida told me.
-No, be quiet.
You can't change the past, but you can forget it.
I've forgotten it, Zoya.
Happy...
I'm happy.
You can be too. I'm sure that... lt's not difficult.
I want to do my best.
Not be angry.
Work hard.
Galina, will you close up tonight?
Martje...
Don't worry. I'll handle it.
Trust me.
Hello...
-Hi... I was wondering if you'd heard anything.
-No.
For you.
-Thank you.
I thought I'd stop by.
Nice flat.
I know what its like to lose a husband, suddenly like that.
How are you?
Zoya, no.
The machine has to stay on.
-Why?
Martje say so.
She knows what's best.
Who's in there?
That's the boiler room Nobody's in there.
There's a man in there.
Loe?
is Loe in there?
-Who's Loe?
Come on.
Turn off the machine and listen.
Martje, she says he's not in there.
Turn it off and listen for yourself.
-No.
Martje's the boss.
Be glad you've got a job.
Listen or bugger off.
Galina... lf l'm right...
If Loe really is in there, then what?
I have no sympathy for the man.
I'm concerned about Martje, not him.
What will happen to her if we do nothing?
Martje knows what she's doing.
You must trust her.
We can't trust her, she's been humiliated.
I won't hear a bad word about Martje.
If she wants our help she'll ask for it.
And that shoe isn't Loe's.
His feet are much bigger.
It's good to talk about him.
It'll help you cope.
How long were you together?
-Eight years.
Eight years?
-Yes.
Happy?
I expected it to be different.
Loe did too, maybe.
Look... when we married we expected to have children.
We bought lots of things.
A Winnie-the-Pooh crib... I imagined how we'd walk in the park, with our baby in the pram.
How he'd look at the baby and at me.
The proud father.
And I could imagine our rows... about who the baby took after and such things.
But, a baby never came.
I don't know, maybe our marriage started to bore him.
Are you on your own?
No, I met someone recently.
Do you have any children?
-Yes, one.
A son.
I'd given up hope.
It was like a gift from heaven.
Dorien here.
Hi, Mum, no nothing yet... I have to go, or they'll worry at home.
Take care.
Don't give up hope.
Tomorrow.
I'll be ready then.
I've arranged everything.
You won't be startled by me again.
Everything will be perfect tomorrow.
You're so pushy, Loe.
An aperitif.
I was going to save it for when we were together.
Shall I tell you what I'm going to wear tomorrow?
No, I won't tell you.
It'll be a surprise.
What are you going to wear?
It's sweet of you to give me the time, Loe.
You're sweet.
Now what?
-We have a problem, Martje.
People keep asking why the machine is on all the time.
It's not good for the business.
-A machine can always break down.
When can it be turned off?
The machine?
-Yes.
It's fixed.
Didn't I say?
I had it repaired.
We can turn it off this evening.
The problem's solved.
Everything'll be fine now.
Yes?
-Yes, really.
You look after things here, I'll be right back.
This fits like your own breast.
Tennis, swimming, no problem.
Lovely, isn't it?
26.44, please.
-Hey, Martje.
Hi.
Yes, keeps them dry.
Thank you.
Bye.
Martje, how foxy.
Just look at you.
-Show a bit of respect for your boss.
I'm only saying it's great to see.
She doesn't let herself be fucked around.
I regard that as a compliment.
Have a really nice weekend, girls.
-You too.
Bye, girls.
Wait...
Here.
Dancetrend.
I hear it's really nice.
Children your age should go out in the weekend.
Jan can spend the night with me.
-Jan?
Give Zoya a kiss.
That's right, big guy.
is that enough?
Say goodbye.
Bye, have fun.
Big guy.
Mummy's proud of you.
Yes.
There's lipstick on your little vest.
I'm cooking a chicken.
Look at this.
In it goes.
Coming, Loe?
Papa'll be right here.
Papa's coming to play with us.
That brings a smile.
He's smiling.
Coming, Loe?
Lift and fold the collar back.
You haven't put it on yet.
Loe... I wore this specially for you.
Don't cry.
No, don't cry.
Come here, don't cry.
I have to feed Jan.
It'll give us some peace during dinner.
Come on...
There...
Drink now.
Come along, drink.
No, don't cry.
There, there...
Please, drink now.
You can have this back.
I only want money for my work.
What a racket.
Come along now...
Mummy hasn't time for your fussing.
Drink.
Maybe I can get him quiet.
Yes, fine.
You feed him.
Here, he can put his new clothes on.
Can you smell it, Loe?
It's not haute cuisine but it is... a grilled chicken.
And two glasses...
This blue really suits you.
There...
Martje?
...and a fine, smooth whisky.
Hi, Zoya, do you know Loe?
This is Loe.
He's a great dancer.
Shall we dance, Loe?
Blue suits him, doesn't it?
It suits you, Your Royal Highness.
Do you want more chicken?
I've had enough too.
Martje...
He wants you.
He's tired.
Give him to me.
Will you put him to bed?
Be right back.
I have to put Jan to bed.
You're so tired.
Let's have a nice sleep.
He's quiet now.
He can stay with us.
Get away from him.
Martje, look...
Feel.
He's cold.
He doesn't move anymore.
He has to go.
Go to bed.
When you wake up it'll be over
Martje.
I'll take care of it.
A small fire in a container, that's all.
Let me take him.
-No, don't touch him.
Keep off...
He's mine.
Go away.
I'm the one he likes.
Martje, please...
-Let go.
Martje, think.
Everyone will find out.
What happens then?
To you?
To the business?
Where will everyone go?
Where will I go?
It's all your fault.
Martje, please.
Martje, Jan needs you.
He can't help it.
Martje, Jan needs you.
Zoya...
Sorry, my sweetie.
Hush now, mummie's here.
Everything will be all right.
Do you hear the sea, Loe?
Hear it?
We'll go swimming tomorrow I know a beach that nobody ever uses.
You're cold.
It's cold in here, isn't it?
Previously on Nip / Tuck:
Ms. Gaines was brutalized by a serial rapist.
The Carver.
That's what they're calling him.
We ran into Julia last night on a date with some guy.
It bothered me more than I thought it would.
You are the child's biological mother.
I fear for his life if he remains with you.
I'm granting the Sutherlands' request for custody.
Christian, do something.
Looks like a basal cell carcinoma.
Nothing to worry about.
I can take it off with a local right here in the office, Mrs. Camden.
That's Ms. Camden.
My divorce was final three weeks ago.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm also sorry to say that you'll have to stop the nude sunbathing.
Nope.
Tan lines are for strippers and German tourists.
Then you'll have to find someone to cover that... three-spinning-classes-a-week rear end of yours in SPF 50.
And how do you suppose I'll ever find someone to perform that thankless task?
So how's next Tuesday for you, Ms. Camden?
I think I can fit you in.
Hey, asshole.
You're like herpes.
Every time I feel like I'm getting my life back...
I have a Gina outbreak.
What do you want from me?
I need to talk.
You need to listen.
Jesus, what is this?
Step 9?
No need to apologize about how you acted, Gina.
I don't give a shit.
- I'm positive.
- Positive about what?
I had a fungus in my mouth.
The doctor at the clinic said it was Candid-something.
- Candida albicans.
- Yeah.
I guess that could be an early symptom for HIV... so they tested me.
- When did you find out?
- A week.
Two weeks, maybe.
I'm all right, though.
They gave me some antibiotics... for the fungus and put me on the cocktail.
Do they know when you contracted it?
They're not sure.
Six months or a year.
That's why I'm here, to tell you to get tested.
How could you be so irresponsible?
You didn't stop to sheath your sword, Sir Screws-A-Lot!
- I should have double-bagged it with you.
- You didn't, asshole, did you?
Because you thought you were invincible and you didn't give a shit about me... or any of the sluts you dumped your load into over the past two decades!
Get out.
Get out of my life.
No, wait.
Please, I need your help to get a hold of James and Wilber!
The doctor said I could have passed it on to him in utero.
I don't care about me, but I need to know if my baby's sick.
I could deal with the pills and with the pain... but I cannot stand not knowing if he's all right.
I am not helping you find shit.
You're a poison, Gina.
Everything you touch gets infected with your own special brand of misery.
The way I figure it, asshole, we're a match made in hell.
You know the only difference between you and me?
I take responsibility for my mistakes.
"Beauty is a curse on the world. "
That's what he said when he did this to me.
And he's right.
The way I look has been my curse my whole life.
You can't take responsibility for what happened to you, Mr. Rourke.
You were brutalized by a very deranged individual.
My looks were his bait.
I never wanted to be a model.
I was discovered at the beach, celebrating an A in Legal Ethics.
A photographer came up to me, took a few pictures, and a month later...
I'm skipping the bar exam to be on the cover of the J. Crew catalog.
Sounds like a dream come true.
May I?
I understand that you must be feeling hopeless right now... but have you seen Naomi Gaines?
She was one of The Carver's first, right?
Yes.
We did her corrective surgery.
She just booked the cover of SELF.
There's no reason why your surgery won't be as successful as hers.
We'll use musculature from your inner thighs to repair...
- the nerve damage and cover the scarring.
- Not all of it.
Leave some of the cut on the right side.
The muscle loss from your legs won't be noticeable...
- if that's what you're worried about.
- Look...
I have a responsibility to myself to be more than... some two-dimensional image in some men's fitness magazine, okay?
Did you sustain any other injuries besides the cuts to your face?
This is all covered under the doctor-patient confidentiality, right?
Yes.
I've got a maxi pad shoved down the back of my pants.
He raped me.
I've been shitting razor blades for a week.
I can bench 275 pounds.
I'm a goddamn black belt in Kenpo... but I couldn't keep the son of a bitch...
He overpowered you?
He drugged me.
He shot me up with something.
I couldn't move, I couldn't talk.
We can repair the damage to your rectum at the same time we work on your face.
Until then, I'll prescribe some stool softeners.
I'm sorry I have to ask... but have you had yourself tested for HIV?
No need to.
Asshole had enough self-control to use a condom.
Police said it was to avoid leaving any DNA evidence... but I think the guy just assumed all male models were gay.
He was just protecting his ass.
Can't be too careful nowadays, right?
What's this?
Just running some blood work.
I've been feeling a little weak lately.
I thought I might have a vitamin deficiency.
More like a self-control deficiency.
You're not 20 anymore, pal.
Those all-nighters are catching up to you.
- Here, let me.
- No.
I was always better at finding the vein than you were.
What's going on with you?
Gina's HIV positive.
Well, you... slept with Gina... what, three times?
I assume you never engaged in any... high-risk behavior with her:
multiple partners... anal sex.
Wouldn't go back there with a monkey stick.
Good.
Then I'm sure you're fine.
The statistical probability of you contracting the virus... from low-risk heterosexual activity is actually very small.
Is that why you put gloves on to take my blood?
Look, even if you do have the virus this isn't the '80s anymore.
The cocktail's been wildly successful in suppressing symptoms.
- People are living for years.
- Some are, some aren't.
The media has just decided that the stories of the living... are more interesting than the stories of the dying.
Nobody talks about the side effects of the cocktail.
The chronic diarrhea, kidney stones, fat redistribution.
I'm just saying you can still have a normal life.
Normal life?
Do you realize what this means?
Besides having to donate my dick to charity... we're gonna have to reveal my status to our patients, Sean.
Would you want an HIV-positive surgeon operating on you?
Stop being my doctor.
Start being my friend.
Well, as your friend... and your doctor...
I suggest you go through your BlackBerry, you get a hold of... every woman you exchanged bodily fluids with since your exposure.
I'll start calling after I get my results back.
How long will that take?
Two, three days?
How many of the women are gonna sleep with other men during that time?
Lives are at stake here, Christian.
Including my mother-in-law's.
I'm here for you.
I'll help you through all of this... good results or bad, but you got to own up to your part.
You may not have been responsible with the women, but you're responsible now... for what you might have unknowingly done to them.
Hi, Erica?
It's Christian.
Good to talk to you, too.
Look, Erica, I'm going to cut to the chase here.
I've been with someone who tested HIV positive, which means I might be.
Which means you might be.
I didn't say I had it.
I said she had it.
I tested myself today.
I'm just saying that maybe you should do the same.
Look, sweetheart, don't put this exclusively on me.
You're the one who put my hand up your skirt.
Why would I consider condoms?
You haven't considered a pregnancy scare since Gabe Kaplan was a celebrity.
Yeah, well, you're full of shit, Erica.
I did not violate you!
I don't remember you asking about my sexual history... when you were bent over my desk with your ass hanging out, Ms. Camden!
You don't think I'm in pain over this?
Stop crying.
Stop crying.
Stop crying.
But how do we stop attacks that are so random?
How do we fight an enemy so vicious?
One man with an answer to these questions is Dr. Sean McNamara... a plastic surgeon from Miami... who dedicated his time and skills to fix what The Carver destroys.
He looks good.
Makeup, a little Vaseline on the lens, hell, my dog looks like Demi.
Shut up.
It's not for money.
You're losing thousands in OR time... to help these victims gratis.
Well, that's just it, isn't it?
It's for the victims.
Sometimes we, as a society, have to stop just watching the news... and understand that we play a part in all this.
That we have a responsibility to our communities to stand up and fight.
I use a scalpel to do my talking, but we all have tools.
The police report that The Carver... delivers a message to his victims before he cuts them.
"Beauty is a curse on the world. "
You're a plastic surgeon.
How can you not take that personally?
I do.
Look, we all get caught up in the myth of beauty.
The difference between what The Carver does and what I do... is that he's trying to make people look as ugly as he feels on the inside.
I'm trying to make people as beautiful as they feel on the inside.
This is Andrea Hall reporting from Miami Beach.
Back to you.
Nurse Kimberly...
I've never seen anyone take someone's temperature using that.
Cut.
Okay.
It was good.
Remember what's going on here, Fantasia.
He just slept with a candy striper... so this blowjob isn't to get him off.
It's to get him to love you.
Okay?
All right.
You should take your tit out sooner because we're not reading it on camera.
Okay.
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
Can we talk someplace private?
Yeah.
You'd think that being on a porn set all day would make you horny... but after a couple hours, it's like the last thing you want to do is get laid.
I might be HIV positive.
This is serious, Kimber.
- You have to get yourself tested.
- Well, I have been.
Every month.
I just got my PNR/DNA results back last week.
I mean, it's sort of an unwritten law in this business.
HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea.
I'm clean.
Thank God.
Good.
I still have one call to make.
James and Wilber.
I'm so sorry, Christian.
Hey.
It's okay.
I'm all alone, Kimber.
I've had sex with a thousand women, but the truth is I haven't... been intimate with a single one.
You were intimate with me.
You tried to be, at least, and that counts for something.
Why are you so good to me?
Because I love you, Christian.
You love the idea of me.
Money, good looks, nice things.
On paper, I'm your perfect man.
But how will feel about me when I have no hair... and I can't eat a bowl of brown rice without throwing up... and I'm lying in a hospital bed wearing a diaper?
Your heart will still be there.
And so will I.
Amazing drug, isn't it?
It's a modified form of mivacurium chloride.
They use it on violent psych patients.
Causes a kind of waking coma.
Should wear off in a few minutes.
It's like a plane crash, though.
A few minutes waiting to hit the ground can feel like a lifetime.
Awful feeling.
Being totally helpless, having no control.
That's how most people spend their lives.
Slaves to the tyranny of beauty.
Carb counting and kickboxing classes and chemical peels.
I'm rescuing people from all of that... and you are destroying my work.
They call me The Carver.
I'm an artist.
You are the carver.
Fifty noses all the same, 1,000 flawless breasts.
You're the monster... carving what's beautiful and real out of life.
This is my city now, Doctor.
The drugs are wearing off.
That's good.
Beauty is a curse on the world.
It keeps us from seeing who the real monsters are.
Repair one of my masterpieces again and the next time I'll kill you.
I didn't see his face.
He was wearing some kind of Mardi-Gras mask.
I don't understand how he got in.
We have an alarm.
Looks like he broke in through your son's bedroom... at some point during the day, and waited until you got home.
I'm going to put a uniform out front 24/7.
One at your office, too.
Let's take a look.
- Sweetheart.
- Thanks for coming over.
I didn't tell them to call you, but I'm glad they did.
We're going to need some fresh bandages on this.
I'll get them.
Not as bad as the others.
Angle of incision is above the nerve.
Shouldn't be too complicated to fix.
We'll drop everything, have you on the table first thing.
I'll get Quentin Costa from Atlanta for this.
He's the best face man in the country.
I don't care if I have to charter a plane to get him here myself.
Thank you.
You know I'd do it myself if I could.
- He didn't...
- No.
I can't thank you enough for coming down on such short notice for this.
Oh, please.
After what the two of you have done for all of these Carver victims... it's just the least I could do.
So your office said that you recently got back from Sudan.
That's gruesome shit over there.
These rebels, they're basically mutilating entire villages.
I was reattaching noses and ears that had been macheted off.
Another soldier for lost causes.
Sean is going to love you.
Don't get me wrong.
I did reward myself with a bottle of '83 Chateau Mouton... and a suite at the Shore Club when I got back, so...
I have some very fond memories of the Shore Club.
You and I need to get a drink there.
I think we could tear this town up.
Sure.
The nerve damage seems to be minimal, so there shouldn't be any... serious microsurgery.
Just some irrigating and grafting.
- We already discussed that, didn't we?
- Twice.
Doc, relax.
Your partner's in good hands.
He's not just my partner.
He's my best friend.
I don't want his electric razor knowing what happened to his face.
It won't.
A man's got to look as good as his waiting room, right?
I'm sorry, I...
This damn wrist.
I respect your skills, it's just... having someone else work on Sean's face is like... having another man sleep with my wife.
I promise I'll be gentle.
How are we feeling, Doctor?
Feels weird being on this side.
I can't stop shaking from the adrenaline.
Better give me 10 cc's of Versed.
This is your day off.
Just sit back and let us do the driving.
You'll be fine, buddy.
I'll be here with you every step of the way.
Let's hit it.
Marking pen.
He's so big.
I think he remembers you.
Hey, Wilber.
Gabriel.
Right.
Come in.
We live in a very tight community.
Our physician lives two doors down.
It was hard enough telling everyone that I had a child out of wedlock.
How was I supposed to explain... that I now needed to have that child and myself tested for AIDS?
What about Cicely?
Do we need to have her tested, too?
We haven't been that way for a long time.
Is this thing going to kill me, Christian?
I'd be shocked if you had it, James.
But if I do... am I going to die?
Cross that bridge if we come to it, okay?
You shun your responsibility for one night... and you're caught in the wake forever.
Your turn, buddy.
Come here.
You're such a big boy.
How's he been?
Good.
Standing up on his own now.
He's talking like crazy.
Bottle.
Bye-bye.
Dada.
What about him?
If he's sick, what are we going to do?
Chances are very low that he contracted it from her.
If he did...
I'm sure there are good pediatric AIDS specialists... in Scottsdale or Phoenix.
If it's necessary, I'd like you to be a part of his treatment.
Having a doctor you trust and can get on the phone... can make all the difference.
Of course I will.
How is Gina, by the way?
I don't know.
She can rot.
May I give you some advice?
I have hated Gina... cursed her many times.
But then I look at Gabriel... and I can't help but see the good in her.
He's the one good thing she did in her life.
Sometimes one good thing is enough... so whatever love you still feel for him... you owe to her.
Very nice.
Dr. Costa's almost as talented as you are, Sean.
I'm glad your practice is in Atlanta, Dr. Costa.
Any closer, I'd be a walking ad for the competition.
Well, I'm happy being a big fish in my small pond.
Wouldn't dream of swimming here with you two sharks... unless you made me one of your own.
I'll leave you in the hands of your capable partner, Dr. McNamara.
Thanks again, Doctor.
Thank you.
It's safe to say you can restart your modeling career if you want to.
Come on, partner, smile.
You're on the mend.
Am I?
Doctors.
Thank you.
I come bearing bad news.
We found this next to the carved face of a teenage girl.
Homecoming queen at Coral Gables Prep.
Christ.
That's my son's school.
He hit her last night.
Parents are a mess.
They were out to dinner.
- Why is he leaving one of our cards there?
- It's a dare.
He wants to know if we're going to fix her.
We're sure as hell not going to.
I appreciate your desire to help these people, Sean... but not at the price this guy's charging.
Nobody's going to think twice if you don't want to take this girl on.
But I need to let the parents know, though.
They requested you specifically.
I guess they heard the piece on the news.
So are you going to do it?
This really isn't necessary, Julia.
I had to pick up Annie, anyway, so I think staying for an extra half an hour... to make you something to eat... and straighten up the place isn't going to kill me.
Is there anything else you need?
Well, if you're asking, could you bring me that tube of vitamin E?
Wow.
That looks great.
Christian really outdid himself.
No, here, let me.
It constantly amazes me what you plastic surgeons can do.
You guys don't get the credit you deserve.
Really?
I always thought you had issues with what I did.
Well, honestly, Sean, I did.
Whenever I used to tell people what my husband did for a living... there was always a little shame behind it.
The shallowness of the industry.
How it plays into our culture.
Self-loathing.
You know?
The sick person who's doing this?
I hate to admit it, but there's a bit of truth in his message.
I've contributed to the cult of beauty.
Built this house.
My work begat his work.
No, Sean, you can't do that to yourself.
Now, I was wrong to be ashamed.
Really?
What you're doing to help... those poor people that that monster is mutilating... you should be proud of yourself for that.
I'm proud of you for that.
I wish you could have felt more of that when we were together.
Maybe I needed some perspective... to be able to really see you.
- Is that enough?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
They want me to fix this girl he attacked the other night.
Her parents asked for me specifically.
Her parents don't know that he's threatened to kill you... if you correct his work.
You think I should do the operation?
My advice would be... to ask you what you think.
I think I'm scared.
Oh, baby.
You don't have to, you know?
- What will you think of me if I don't?
- What is the difference?
The difference is no matter how much you hurt me... or how disconnected we are, I still crave your respect.
I did when I was in school, just starting the business.
Now it's still what lifts me up.
Listen, maybe you should stay here until they catch this guy.
You can stay in here, I'll take Matt's room.
I think he found a way to pirate the adult channels on his cable box.
I just don't want you out there unprotected and alone.
But I'm not alone, Sean.
Kevin is with me.
Ready when you are, Sean.
15-blade.
- What's with this hospital pit stop?
- You tell me.
There's one doctor in the whole place, and his third language is English.
This doesn't make sense.
You have low-grade URI but... your white-cell count is at three.
The cocktail should have prevented all of this.
I'm sure it would if I was taking it.
You're not taking your...
Jesus, Gina.
- What, do you got a death wish?
- No.
I have no health insurance.
I guess that's the same thing.
- Why didn't you come to me?
- And beg you for money?
I hate myself, but not that much.
Bed sores?
No... but every muscle in my body is in a knot.
Roll over.
There you go.
I'm clean.
Good.
That's good.
Even you don't deserve this.
I just got the results for James and Wilber.
Gabriel.
They're negative.
How did he look?
Good.
Big.
He's got your eyes.
I screwed everything up, Christian.
Do you know what it's like to lie sick in a hospital bed... and have no one come to visit you for days?
It's not that I burned bridges, I just... never built them.
I don't want to die alone.
Remember the time Wilber exploded all over you?
He ruined that shirt.
That kid could crap like an Olympian.
And what about the time we gave him his first Cheerio... and he was flapping his arms around like he just... tasted a little "O"-shaped piece of heaven?
Thank you.
For what?
For him.

Previously on Nip / Tuck:
Ms. Gaines was brutalized by a serial rapist.
The Carver.
That's what they're calling him.
We ran into Julia last night on a date with some guy.
It bothered me more than I thought it would.
You are the child's biological mother.
I fear for his life if he remains with you.
I'm granting the Sutherlands' request for custody.
Christian, do something.
Looks like a basal cell carcinoma.
Nothing to worry about.
I can take it off with a local right here in the office, Mrs. Camden.
That's Ms. Camden.
My divorce was final three weeks ago.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm also sorry to say that you'll have to stop the nude sunbathing.
Nope.
Tan lines are for strippers and German tourists.
Then you'll have to find someone to cover that... three-spinning-classes-a-week rear end of yours in SPF 50.
And how do you suppose I'll ever find someone to perform that thankless task?
So how's next Tuesday for you, Ms. Camden?
I think I can fit you in.
Hey, asshole.
You're like herpes.
Every time I feel like I'm getting my life back...
I have a Gina outbreak.
What do you want from me?
I need to talk.
You need to listen.
Jesus, what is this?
Step 9?
No need to apologize about how you acted, Gina.
I don't give a shit.
- I'm positive.
- Positive about what?
I had a fungus in my mouth.
The doctor at the clinic said it was Candid-something.
- Candida albicans.
- Yeah.
I guess that could be an early symptom for HIV... so they tested me.
- When did you find out?
- A week.
Two weeks, maybe.
I'm all right, though.
They gave me some antibiotics... for the fungus and put me on the cocktail.
Do they know when you contracted it?
They're not sure.
Six months or a year.
That's why I'm here, to tell you to get tested.
How could you be so irresponsible?
You didn't stop to sheath your sword, Sir Screws-A-Lot!
- I should have double-bagged it with you.
- You didn't, asshole, did you?
Because you thought you were invincible and you didn't give a shit about me... or any of the sluts you dumped your load into over the past two decades!
Get out.
Get out of my life.
No, wait.
Please, I need your help to get a hold of James and Wilber!
The doctor said I could have passed it on to him in utero.
I don't care about me, but I need to know if my baby's sick.
I could deal with the pills and with the pain... but I cannot stand not knowing if he's all right.
I am not helping you find shit.
You're a poison, Gina.
Everything you touch gets infected with your own special brand of misery.
The way I figure it, asshole, we're a match made in hell.
You know the only difference between you and me?
I take responsibility for my mistakes.
"Beauty is a curse on the world. "
That's what he said when he did this to me.
And he's right.
The way I look has been my curse my whole life.
You can't take responsibility for what happened to you, Mr. Rourke.
You were brutalized by a very deranged individual.
My looks were his bait.
I never wanted to be a model.
I was discovered at the beach, celebrating an A in Legal Ethics.
A photographer came up to me, took a few pictures, and a month later...
I'm skipping the bar exam to be on the cover of the J. Crew catalog.
Sounds like a dream come true.
May I?
I understand that you must be feeling hopeless right now... but have you seen Naomi Gaines?
She was one of The Carver's first, right?
Yes.
We did her corrective surgery.
She just booked the cover of SELF.
There's no reason why your surgery won't be as successful as hers.
We'll use musculature from your inner thighs to repair...
- the nerve damage and cover the scarring.
- Not all of it.
Leave some of the cut on the right side.
The muscle loss from your legs won't be noticeable...
- if that's what you're worried about.
- Look...
I have a responsibility to myself to be more than... some two-dimensional image in some men's fitness magazine, okay?
Did you sustain any other injuries besides the cuts to your face?
This is all covered under the doctor-patient confidentiality, right?
Yes.
I've got a maxi pad shoved down the back of my pants.
He raped me.
I've been shitting razor blades for a week.
I can bench 275 pounds.
I'm a goddamn black belt in Kenpo... but I couldn't keep the son of a bitch...
He overpowered you?
He drugged me.
He shot me up with something.
I couldn't move, I couldn't talk.
We can repair the damage to your rectum at the same time we work on your face.
Until then, I'll prescribe some stool softeners.
I'm sorry I have to ask... but have you had yourself tested for HIV?
No need to.
Asshole had enough self-control to use a condom.
Police said it was to avoid leaving any DNA evidence... but I think the guy just assumed all male models were gay.
He was just protecting his ass.
Can't be too careful nowadays, right?
What's this?
Just running some blood work.
I've been feeling a little weak lately.
I thought I might have a vitamin deficiency.
More like a self-control deficiency.
You're not 20 anymore, pal.
Those all-nighters are catching up to you.
- Here, let me.
- No.
I was always better at finding the vein than you were.
What's going on with you?
Gina's HIV positive.
Well, you... slept with Gina... what, three times?
I assume you never engaged in any... high-risk behavior with her:
multiple partners... anal sex.
Wouldn't go back there with a monkey stick.
Good.
Then I'm sure you're fine.
The statistical probability of you contracting the virus... from low-risk heterosexual activity is actually very small.
Is that why you put gloves on to take my blood?
Look, even if you do have the virus this isn't the '80s anymore.
The cocktail's been wildly successful in suppressing symptoms.
- People are living for years.
- Some are, some aren't.
The media has just decided that the stories of the living... are more interesting than the stories of the dying.
Nobody talks about the side effects of the cocktail.
The chronic diarrhea, kidney stones, fat redistribution.
I'm just saying you can still have a normal life.
Normal life?
Do you realize what this means?
Besides having to donate my dick to charity... we're gonna have to reveal my status to our patients, Sean.
Would you want an HIV-positive surgeon operating on you?
Stop being my doctor.
Start being my friend.
Well, as your friend... and your doctor...
I suggest you go through your BlackBerry, you get a hold of... every woman you exchanged bodily fluids with since your exposure.
I'll start calling after I get my results back.
How long will that take?
Two, three days?
How many of the women are gonna sleep with other men during that time?
Lives are at stake here, Christian.
Including my mother-in-law's.
I'm here for you.
I'll help you through all of this... good results or bad, but you got to own up to your part.
You may not have been responsible with the women, but you're responsible now... for what you might have unknowingly done to them.
Hi, Erica?
It's Christian.
Good to talk to you, too.
Look, Erica, I'm going to cut to the chase here.
I've been with someone who tested HIV positive, which means I might be.
Which means you might be.
I didn't say I had it.
I said she had it.
I tested myself today.
I'm just saying that maybe you should do the same.
Look, sweetheart, don't put this exclusively on me.
You're the one who put my hand up your skirt.
Why would I consider condoms?
You haven't considered a pregnancy scare since Gabe Kaplan was a celebrity.
Yeah, well, you're full of shit, Erica.
I did not violate you!
I don't remember you asking about my sexual history... when you were bent over my desk with your ass hanging out, Ms. Camden!
You don't think I'm in pain over this?
Stop crying.
Stop crying.
Stop crying.
But how do we stop attacks that are so random?
How do we fight an enemy so vicious?
One man with an answer to these questions is Dr. Sean McNamara... a plastic surgeon from Miami... who dedicated his time and skills to fix what The Carver destroys.
He looks good.
Makeup, a little Vaseline on the lens, hell, my dog looks like Demi.
Shut up.
It's not for money.
You're losing thousands in OR time... to help these victims gratis.
Well, that's just it, isn't it?
It's for the victims.
Sometimes we, as a society, have to stop just watching the news... and understand that we play a part in all this.
That we have a responsibility to our communities to stand up and fight.
I use a scalpel to do my talking, but we all have tools.
The police report that The Carver... delivers a message to his victims before he cuts them.
"Beauty is a curse on the world. "
You're a plastic surgeon.
How can you not take that personally?
I do.
Look, we all get caught up in the myth of beauty.
The difference between what The Carver does and what I do... is that he's trying to make people look as ugly as he feels on the inside.
I'm trying to make people as beautiful as they feel on the inside.
This is Andrea Hall reporting from Miami Beach.
Back to you.
Nurse Kimberly...
I've never seen anyone take someone's temperature using that.
Cut.
Okay.
It was good.
Remember what's going on here, Fantasia.
He just slept with a candy striper... so this blowjob isn't to get him off.
It's to get him to love you.
Okay?
All right.
You should take your tit out sooner because we're not reading it on camera.
Okay.
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
Can we talk someplace private?
Yeah.
You'd think that being on a porn set all day would make you horny... but after a couple hours, it's like the last thing you want to do is get laid.
I might be HIV positive.
This is serious, Kimber.
- You have to get yourself tested.
- Well, I have been.
Every month.
I just got my PNR/DNA results back last week.
I mean, it's sort of an unwritten law in this business.
HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea.
I'm clean.
Thank God.
Good.
I still have one call to make.
James and Wilber.
I'm so sorry, Christian.
Hey.
It's okay.
I'm all alone, Kimber.
I've had sex with a thousand women, but the truth is I haven't... been intimate with a single one.
You were intimate with me.
You tried to be, at least, and that counts for something.
Why are you so good to me?
Because I love you, Christian.
You love the idea of me.
Money, good looks, nice things.
On paper, I'm your perfect man.
But how will feel about me when I have no hair... and I can't eat a bowl of brown rice without throwing up... and I'm lying in a hospital bed wearing a diaper?
Your heart will still be there.
And so will I.
Amazing drug, isn't it?
It's a modified form of mivacurium chloride.
They use it on violent psych patients.
Causes a kind of waking coma.
Should wear off in a few minutes.
It's like a plane crash, though.
A few minutes waiting to hit the ground can feel like a lifetime.
Awful feeling.
Being totally helpless, having no control.
That's how most people spend their lives.
Slaves to the tyranny of beauty.
Carb counting and kickboxing classes and chemical peels.
I'm rescuing people from all of that... and you are destroying my work.
They call me The Carver.
I'm an artist.
You are the carver.
Fifty noses all the same, 1,000 flawless breasts.
You're the monster... carving what's beautiful and real out of life.
This is my city now, Doctor.
The drugs are wearing off.
That's good.
Beauty is a curse on the world.
It keeps us from seeing who the real monsters are.
Repair one of my masterpieces again and the next time I'll kill you.
I didn't see his face.
He was wearing some kind of Mardi-Gras mask.
I don't understand how he got in.
We have an alarm.
Looks like he broke in through your son's bedroom... at some point during the day, and waited until you got home.
I'm going to put a uniform out front 24/7.
One at your office, too.
Let's take a look.
- Sweetheart.
- Thanks for coming over.
I didn't tell them to call you, but I'm glad they did.
We're going to need some fresh bandages on this.
I'll get them.
Not as bad as the others.
Angle of incision is above the nerve.
Shouldn't be too complicated to fix.
We'll drop everything, have you on the table first thing.
I'll get Quentin Costa from Atlanta for this.
He's the best face man in the country.
I don't care if I have to charter a plane to get him here myself.
Thank you.
You know I'd do it myself if I could.
- He didn't...
- No.
I can't thank you enough for coming down on such short notice for this.
Oh, please.
After what the two of you have done for all of these Carver victims... it's just the least I could do.
So your office said that you recently got back from Sudan.
That's gruesome shit over there.
These rebels, they're basically mutilating entire villages.
I was reattaching noses and ears that had been macheted off.
Another soldier for lost causes.
Sean is going to love you.
Don't get me wrong.
I did reward myself with a bottle of '83 Chateau Mouton... and a suite at the Shore Club when I got back, so...
I have some very fond memories of the Shore Club.
You and I need to get a drink there.
I think we could tear this town up.
Sure.
The nerve damage seems to be minimal, so there shouldn't be any... serious microsurgery.
Just some irrigating and grafting.
- We already discussed that, didn't we?
- Twice.
Doc, relax.
Your partner's in good hands.
He's not just my partner.
He's my best friend.
I don't want his electric razor knowing what happened to his face.
It won't.
A man's got to look as good as his waiting room, right?
I'm sorry, I...
This damn wrist.
I respect your skills, it's just... having someone else work on Sean's face is like... having another man sleep with my wife.
I promise I'll be gentle.
How are we feeling, Doctor?
Feels weird being on this side.
I can't stop shaking from the adrenaline.
Better give me 10 cc's of Versed.
This is your day off.
Just sit back and let us do the driving.
You'll be fine, buddy.
I'll be here with you every step of the way.
Let's hit it.
Marking pen.
He's so big.
I think he remembers you.
Hey, Wilber.
Gabriel.
Right.
Come in.
We live in a very tight community.
Our physician lives two doors down.
It was hard enough telling everyone that I had a child out of wedlock.
How was I supposed to explain... that I now needed to have that child and myself tested for AIDS?
What about Cicely?
Do we need to have her tested, too?
We haven't been that way for a long time.
Is this thing going to kill me, Christian?
I'd be shocked if you had it, James.
But if I do... am I going to die?
Cross that bridge if we come to it, okay?
You shun your responsibility for one night... and you're caught in the wake forever.
Your turn, buddy.
Come here.
You're such a big boy.
How's he been?
Good.
Standing up on his own now.
He's talking like crazy.
Bottle.
Bye-bye.
Dada.
What about him?
If he's sick, what are we going to do?
Chances are very low that he contracted it from her.
If he did...
I'm sure there are good pediatric AIDS specialists... in Scottsdale or Phoenix.
If it's necessary, I'd like you to be a part of his treatment.
Having a doctor you trust and can get on the phone... can make all the difference.
Of course I will.
How is Gina, by the way?
I don't know.
She can rot.
May I give you some advice?
I have hated Gina... cursed her many times.
But then I look at Gabriel... and I can't help but see the good in her.
He's the one good thing she did in her life.
Sometimes one good thing is enough... so whatever love you still feel for him... you owe to her.
Very nice.
Dr. Costa's almost as talented as you are, Sean.
I'm glad your practice is in Atlanta, Dr. Costa.
Any closer, I'd be a walking ad for the competition.
Well, I'm happy being a big fish in my small pond.
Wouldn't dream of swimming here with you two sharks... unless you made me one of your own.
I'll leave you in the hands of your capable partner, Dr. McNamara.
Thanks again, Doctor.
Thank you.
It's safe to say you can restart your modeling career if you want to.
Come on, partner, smile.
You're on the mend.
Am I?
Doctors.
Thank you.
I come bearing bad news.
We found this next to the carved face of a teenage girl.
Homecoming queen at Coral Gables Prep.
Christ.
That's my son's school.
He hit her last night.
Parents are a mess.
They were out to dinner.
- Why is he leaving one of our cards there?
- It's a dare.
He wants to know if we're going to fix her.
We're sure as hell not going to.
I appreciate your desire to help these people, Sean... but not at the price this guy's charging.
Nobody's going to think twice if you don't want to take this girl on.
But I need to let the parents know, though.
They requested you specifically.
I guess they heard the piece on the news.
So are you going to do it?
This really isn't necessary, Julia.
I had to pick up Annie, anyway, so I think staying for an extra half an hour... to make you something to eat... and straighten up the place isn't going to kill me.
Is there anything else you need?
Well, if you're asking, could you bring me that tube of vitamin E?
Wow.
That looks great.
Christian really outdid himself.
No, here, let me.
It constantly amazes me what you plastic surgeons can do.
You guys don't get the credit you deserve.
Really?
I always thought you had issues with what I did.
Well, honestly, Sean, I did.
Whenever I used to tell people what my husband did for a living... there was always a little shame behind it.
The shallowness of the industry.
How it plays into our culture.
Self-loathing.
You know?
The sick person who's doing this?
I hate to admit it, but there's a bit of truth in his message.
I've contributed to the cult of beauty.
Built this house.
My work begat his work.
No, Sean, you can't do that to yourself.
Now, I was wrong to be ashamed.
Really?
What you're doing to help... those poor people that that monster is mutilating... you should be proud of yourself for that.
I'm proud of you for that.
I wish you could have felt more of that when we were together.
Maybe I needed some perspective... to be able to really see you.
- Is that enough?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
They want me to fix this girl he attacked the other night.
Her parents asked for me specifically.
Her parents don't know that he's threatened to kill you... if you correct his work.
You think I should do the operation?
My advice would be... to ask you what you think.
I think I'm scared.
Oh, baby.
You don't have to, you know?
- What will you think of me if I don't?
- What is the difference?
The difference is no matter how much you hurt me... or how disconnected we are, I still crave your respect.
I did when I was in school, just starting the business.
Now it's still what lifts me up.
Listen, maybe you should stay here until they catch this guy.
You can stay in here, I'll take Matt's room.
I think he found a way to pirate the adult channels on his cable box.
I just don't want you out there unprotected and alone.
But I'm not alone, Sean.
Kevin is with me.
Ready when you are, Sean.
15-blade.
- What's with this hospital pit stop?
- You tell me.
There's one doctor in the whole place, and his third language is English.
This doesn't make sense.
You have low-grade URI but... your white-cell count is at three.
The cocktail should have prevented all of this.
I'm sure it would if I was taking it.
You're not taking your...
Jesus, Gina.
- What, do you got a death wish?
- No.
I have no health insurance.
I guess that's the same thing.
- Why didn't you come to me?
- And beg you for money?
I hate myself, but not that much.
Bed sores?
No... but every muscle in my body is in a knot.
Roll over.
There you go.
I'm clean.
Good.
That's good.
Even you don't deserve this.
I just got the results for James and Wilber.
Gabriel.
They're negative.
How did he look?
Good.
Big.
He's got your eyes.
I screwed everything up, Christian.
Do you know what it's like to lie sick in a hospital bed... and have no one come to visit you for days?
It's not that I burned bridges, I just... never built them.
I don't want to die alone.
Remember the time Wilber exploded all over you?
He ruined that shirt.
That kid could crap like an Olympian.
And what about the time we gave him his first Cheerio... and he was flapping his arms around like he just... tasted a little "O"-shaped piece of heaven?
Thank you.
For what?
For him.

- SDH
Marie-Loup!
My little Marie!
Marie-Loup?
Oh, thank you, my God.
- Thank you.
- No.
It is not Marie-Loup, Father.
Don't you recognize me?
I'm her daughter.
France.
France?
You got my note.
It was very selfish of me.
But the hope of seeing you again has kept me alive.
Thank God.
But first of all I don't want this falling into the hands of strangers.
Your poor mother wouldn't keep it at the time.
But I was to blame.
I know.
I have read it a thousand times.
Marie with the she-wolf's eyes.
Now that I have met you I've become my true self.
Before that I had a future.
Now I have a destiny.
Here.
1759.
Another life.
Another world.
A year when passions ran high.
I was only a child then, living in a country which in the eyes of history, was still in its infancy.
I had no idea that my country was about to be lost or that by the grace of God, I would survive.
This hostile, beautiful no man's land 10 times bigger than its mother country France.
The same France that was about to sell us for a handful of islands in the sun.
The English were preparing to attack where I was born and when the city of Quebec fell England would seize the keys to a new outpost of her empire.
That was our fate and this is our story.
François.
You're too late, my poor boy.
Your father's just died.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Tell me, Jean-Baptiste did my father leave you some money?
A modest amount but quite enough for me.
- I'm very grateful to him.
- I'll double it.
If you thank me, I'll half it.
Your father gave me instructions.
All the papers are ready and the notary is waiting for you to call on him.
There are a lot of accounts to go through.
We can't have your debtors taking advantage of the situation.
Jean-Baptiste, you're not only shaving me but you're boring me too.
That's quite enough, no?
Come here, you little savage!
Move!
Get away!
No!
Is that splendid decoration for your courage?
Or were you just trying to baptize her with your holy oil?
He's got a knife!
That's enough.
Carry on.
Go back to where you came from.
- You like her, huh?
- Yes.
Good.
Go now.
Madame.
For red blotches and broken veins, madame.
You took quite a risk, my lovely.
Is your sister always this reckless?
She's not my sister.
She's my mother.
But she's so young.
- I was married when I was 14.
- No.
I bet your husband has to keep his eyes open with a spirited girl like you.
He's watching me from on high.
A widow?
Already?
How sad.
Apparently, you have quite a few tricks up your sleeve.
Is there a cream for getting rid of the first wrinkles?
Not today, madame, but I can make you up a pot.
It's a miraculous remedy.
Payment in advance.
I have love potions too.
Has anyone ever told you what beautiful eyes you have?
Yes.
- What's your name?
- France.
François.
My compliments, mademoiselle.
And what's her name?
Marie Carignan.
But everyone calls her Marie-Loup.
It's because she can see in the dark.
You're a...
You're a brave woman.
That's not hard when the men are such cowards.
- All the men?
- There may be the odd exception.
I must admit though, I was scared to death.
That's what I mean.
Courage goes hand-in-hand with fear.
You're teaching her to read.
That's the best gift.
She deserves it.
Thank you.
To who do I have the honor of speaking?
François Le Gardeur, at your service.
- Marie Carignan.
- I know.
You're the miller's daughter.
- François Le Gardeur.
- Xavier Maillard.
I wasn't sure it was you, with all those stripes, minus your beard.
Thank you.
You arrived just in time.
You mean now, or earlier on?
It's done.
Let's have a drink.
Why didn't you tell him the priest was teaching me how to read?
Are you ashamed you don't know how to?
I'm ashamed for your grandfather.
He's never thought studying mattered.
Then I'm going to be more intelligent than you.
More educated than me.
Intelligence doesn't come from here.
It comes from here.
The only thing I care about, sweetie, is that you don't grow up ignorant.
Then you'll be truly free.
I love you, you know?
I always forget.
You'll have to keep telling me.
I love you.
I love you.
- Tell me again.
- I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you...
Don't tell me you've sunk to dabbling in the peasantry.
Bright young girls come to a penny in Quebec.
With all the polish to take their place in society.
Especially now, your heritage will attract them like flies.
Do you think any of those girls would have risked their lives for a savage?
You haven't changed.
I have a very important message for you.
Intendant Bigot wants to meet you.
Tomorrow night.
An invitation or an order?
Don't be too clever with him.
I warn you.
He has no time for braggarts.
That's too bad.
So the priest, he's coughing up yellow stuff.
And he's lost some more hair.
I'll tell you a secret.
Everyone thinks I'm his servant but I'm not.
He bought me.
From a captain in the West Indies.
- No.
You're having me on.
- Oh, I'm not complaining.
- Don't tell me he's never touched you.
- Never.
It's me who touches him when he needs a rub down there.
He says it helps him keep impure thoughts at bay especially when he sees you.
We're going to have a big storm.
I love that.
Go home, all of you.
You're attracting the evil eye.
You don't need to be three for God to listen to you.
Marie-Loup.
My little Marie-Loup.
Can you drop these in some boiling water?
I always knew you were special, even when you were 6.
I've loved you like a daughter, more than a daughter.
Calm yourself, Father.
The fever is making you delirious.
- I know.
- Marie-Loup.
Careful.
You and your late husband were married for several years but you only had one daughter.
What happened?
You didn't try to stop having a family, did you?
Gosselin was always in such a hurry.
God rest his soul.
He should have taken longer.
He never went in deep enough.
He never went deep enough?
- Yes.
- Calm.
Calm.
Calm yourself.
The night is for sleeping, François.
I never knew you were so hard-working.
Neither did I.
Tell me, Jean-Baptiste.
All those farms my father took the families he turned out of their homes and the wheelings and dealings with Intendant Bigot didn't that keep him awake at night?
Not to my knowledge.
He was a strong man.
No.
A hard man.
I'm going to have to pass.
I pass as well, I guess.
My friends "fell for your bluff," as the English say.
But I reckoned, you look too honest to be trusted.
Until the return match, young man?
Your father was luckier than you.
Luckier in cards.
Good evening.
- Gentlemen.
- Monsieur.
An inheritance like yours entails obligations as well as privileges.
Obligations with regard to you, monsieur?
To me and to the colony.
In both private and public interest.
For many years, we have called on your father's good offices for various transactions.
The most important was on the verge of completion when fate...
As soon as you've taken over the reins, we must tie up this affair.
Time is running out.
Do you mean the war, Monsieur Bigot?
Wars are won, my young friend, and peace is paid for.
Which is the most expensive?
And let's not forget that France has her wars in Europe.
So as far as the colonies are concerned...
But there's one colony that France will never abandon.
I only hope God agrees with you.
Rumor has it, that instead of losing Canada our good King Louis will use her as currency.
Everything can be negotiated, Monsieur Le Gardeur, even a country.
Good night, François.
Go.
Here is the minister now.
Good day, Mr. Pitt.
I always knew Mr. Franklin as the American colony's illustrious representative.
I had no idea he was a remarkable inventor too.
You can see both near and far with them.
Ingenious, what?
I was just pointing out to the general how I find what I see extremely worrying, both near and far.
My friend is exasperated by France's scheming.
He demands annexation of Canada by Britain.
Aren't we already at war over that very issue?
Precisely, general.
That is why we must continue the action your army began at Arcady over the entire territory.
We must rid ourselves of the Canadians and the savages for good.
By deporting them?
By having them swear allegiance to the crown of England.
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.
- But you don't need them, madame.
- Thank you.
Some days I do, some days I don't.
I had a very rejuvenating potion this morning, as it happens.
Let me do something about that.
- For you.
- No, I can't accept it.
Do as I say.
This is my house.
I'm giving the orders.
It's magnificent.
- But why?
- Because I'm your friend.
And also because I want you to come to the intendant's ball.
- So that's what this dress is for?
- You're so naive.
No, this is for everyday wear.
Wait.
This is for you.
But I keep all the memories still clinging to it.
I thought I heard voices.
An unexpected visitor.
A little wildcat I've taken under my wing.
You saw her at the market the other day.
Bigot's asked me to give her to him for the intendant's ball.
You're in a hurry to leave all of a sudden.
Bigot's lucky to have such an understanding mistress.
Do you often give him presents like that?
Whenever a pretty girl catches his eye.
But she still has to be interested in his advances.
That girl has quite a strong character.
Good.
He knows how to force them if they resist.
- I'm going.
- Oh, I could tell you some stories.
You impressed him last night and you're in his good books now after letting him win.
Good morning, Marie Carignan.
I recognized you from a distance.
Wasn't difficult.
I wasn't expecting to see you here.
Our paths must be destined to cross.
Our paths don't cross, monsieur.
They follow each other.
Did Mademoiselle de Roquebrune send you?
I wouldn't have gone there if I had known I'd see you again today.
But if I hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen you.
You're seeing me now.
What does it change?
A lot of things.
You make me want to look further ahead than the present moment.
You're very friendly with Intendant Bigot, apparently.
Why don't you tell him to stop looting our farms and bleeding us dry?
Tell him yourself.
You've been invited to the palace, haven't you?
A word of advice, if I may.
Don't go.
You obviously feel I don't fit in there.
You fit in Mademoiselle de Roquebrune's good books for sure.
Ever wondered why?
I'll ask her myself when I'll see her at the ball.
Please do.
People in town say you're a witch.
They're the first ones to come to me with a toothache.
Don't look after them.
That will teach them.
It wouldn't teach them anything.
You know, evil is one disease that can't be cured.
Let's go eat.
Grandmother's waiting.
Look.
Over there.
Oh, yes, in the undergrowth.
I see him now.
My God!
He's enormous.
Save me, Maman!
Welcome!
- Hi, Grandma.
- My dear.
Look.
I found you some sarsaparilla roots.
Oh, they're nice.
Thank you.
Hello, Father.
- Hello, Grandfather.
- Hi.
Haven't you forgotten something?
Bread is holy, my girl.
Don't you ever forget it.
Bless us, our Lord, and these, thy fruits that we are about to receive from thy bounty.
Aren't you going to make the sign of the cross, you little savage?
Don't start all that again, Father.
You know she hasn't been baptized.
She doesn't think the same way we do.
Leave her alone.
Those savages don't have souls until they're baptized.
Go and ask the priest if you don't believe me.
Anyway, he's got nothing to be proud of with that dirty Negress of his.
I hardly know you now, Father.
You rant and rave about everything.
You hate the savages.
You hate the Negroes.
You have no respect for anyone.
And what's worse, you think you're right about everything.
That's dangerous.
Everyone in this house is miserable.
Do you really want to isolate yourself?
Because you are doing just that.
We go through this farce every year.
You accuse us of robbing you, but how do you expect us to feed the army defending you from the English?
We know all about your scheming, Lavigueur.
You auctioned off my sow instead of feeding the army.
I know.
My brother was at the sale and he recognized her.
You should know that all sows look alike.
Same as assholes, sergeant.
Except that some are shittier than others.
Don't let him get away.
Hello, Monsieur Le Gardeur.
Hello, Marie-Loup.
Hello.
Shame on you, Basile Lavigueur!
- Good Lord.
He's really cured.
- Lf you don't want to go to hell go back to being a butcher.
- It's a miracle.
Stop persecuting the poor.
A witch's trickery, you mean.
I don't make the decisions, Father.
I'm only following orders.
Tell the Intendant Bigot for me that the local people have barely enough food to feed their own families.
He'll end up with a revolt on his hands.
Now go.
Go!
Let me through.
Let me through.
- Let me through.
- Go back home!
That's an order!
Or else there's going to be trouble.
You're lucky you're wearing a cassock, Father.
Otherwise, I'd show you what people get for challenging the authorities.
Hey, I'm not wearing a cassock.
Go ahead.
Show me.
You're very brave.
Monsieur de Vaudreuil?
Oh, pardon.
Monsieur le Gouverneur.
My name will do.
All titles are valueless in the house of the Lord who wore only a crown of thorns.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Nouvelle-France is in grave danger, Father.
Imminent danger.
You can defend Nouvelle-France.
The people here trust you.
Probably because I'm a born and bred Canadian, like them.
It's both my weakness and my strength.
A few months ago you asked me if I knew anyone you could trust.
I remember catching you off balance.
Since then, however, I've met a brave young man who has guts and a heart.
Really?
The Major General Wolfe who we put in charge of the army invading Canada.
America will be the center of world finance and commerce before very long.
That's a fact, not a prediction.
What is equally certain is we can only defend our interests by negotiating the annexation of Canada and the West Indies.
Negotiate?
We cannot negotiate an annexation.
It's weakness.
Annexation is won.
The French colonies stretch as far as Louisiana.
It's an insult.
No matter.
I have control of the river Saint-Laurent.
And the ships supplying the rebels are all being intercepted.
Not one will get through.
Not one.
Calm down, general.
Quebec must be taken before the river freezes.
I will take Louisburg and with your permission, I will take Quebec and Montreal.
If the city refuses to give in I will torch and shell it 24 hours a day.
I will burn their crops upstream and downstream.
I'll destroy the farms and livestock.
I will leave a trail of famine and devastation behind me.
Excuse me.
I think I need some air.
Excuse me, sir.
Monsieur Le Gardeur.
François Le Gardeur greetings.
You were recommended to me by a mutual friend Father Blondeau.
He sings your praises.
What do you want with me, monsieur?
I want you to go to Versailles and talk to Madame de Pompadour.
Me?
Go to Paris?
You went to university there, didn't you?
And read political sciences, what's more.
So you must know that France's foreign policy is run by the marquises.
How can I succeed where you have failed?
An emissary is more eloquent than letters and reports that get lost.
And what's more, it's high time that the born-and-bred Canadians took their destiny into their own hands.
When should I leave?
As soon as possible.
May I suggest you begin your mission by a visit to Geneva.
- Geneva?
- Ferney.
It's very close.
I think I can arrange a meeting for you with France's leading influence in the universe of ideas.
Voltaire?
But he's violently opposed to the Canadian cause.
Violently opposed, but not an enemy.
He'll listen to you intelligently.
And besides, he's one of La Pompadour's protégés which doesn't hurt.
Come.
I see your disdain for the peasantry has its exceptions.
Like your scorn for the aristocracy.
I hear you're getting on very nicely with Gouverneur Vaudreuil.
Did you give him some beaver pelts?
That would explain it.
Laugh if you like but there's nothing laughable about the situation.
We must talk, Xavier.
You know I trust you.
Come.
- You are beautiful.
- So are you.
Come.
I'll show you around.
He recognized you, and the dress too.
He won't have much difficulties separating one from the other.
What wonderfully wide eyes.
Perfect.
He saw you with your daughter the other day.
- I told him she was your sister.
- Why?
So you can play at being a pure young girl.
Nothing excites him as much as conquering virgin territory.
He's bored with colonialism.
It takes two to play.
Don't count on me.
Hoity-toity.
What a little miss.
I expected you to be grateful.
Don't disappoint me.
You should be honored instead of giving yourself airs and graces.
How naive I was ever to believe in your friendship, madame.
Don't be such a little idiot.
You won't get very far and you'll just make a fool of yourself.
I only want what's best for you, once Bigot's happy, of course.
I know him.
He'll handle the whole thing correctly so get what you can out of it.
He's capable of anything, even generosity.
I'd rather he saved his generosity for you.
I'll never let myself be treated like that.
Good.
He loves being stood up to.
One word of advice, though.
Don't use your nails or your teeth if you don't want them pulled out.
He can be cruel too.
We're here to enjoy ourselves, damn it.
I've got to talk to you about Bigot.
And documents I found concerning him among my father's papers.
What sort of documents?
Documents that could send him and the other conspirators to the Bastille for a very long time.
You're risking your head, spreading slander like that.
If my word isn't enough for you, come to my house and see for yourself.
Why didn't you talk to Gouverneur Vaudreuil about it as you're getting along so well?
I already have.
Mind you, any illusions he might have had about Bigot vanished ages ago.
There's a very good chance that I go to Paris on a confidential mission.
This is strictly between us.
François, you can count on my loyalty.
How could I forget that the Marquis de Vaudreuil has authority over Bigot.
Come.
You know where to take her.
Make sure she's ready for me.
I'm in no mood for foreplay.
I'll do my best.
But I warn you, she's rather stubborn, I'm afraid.
All the better.
Truss her up and I'll ram her.
Thank you.
Lucky girl.
Pardon me.
Sorry.
Your attention, please.
Look.
Look.
Guard?
Look.
Wonderful.
Scissors?
Scissors?
Bravo.
This is the way you thank me?
I've never been so humiliated in all my life.
Oh, I know, I should have listened to you.
No, your only mistake was not believing in my friendship.
Friendship, in exchange for what?
You're just like the rest of them.
It's all a game to you.
You really think so?
No, but I wish I did.
You probably think I've nothing to be proud about.
No.
I know I'm not important or influential, monsieur.
But I am my own person.
You're stronger than me.
Go on.
Make me.
I don't care.
And if you kissed me first would you care then?
No.
That would change everything.
You're bound to make me suffer sooner or later.
So we might as well get it over with.
Go right away.
Don't waste a minute.
Grab all his father's papers, the registers, bills, everything.
Shouldn't we arrest him?
He must still be around.
I don't want any scandals here.
The papers first.
As for your friend, seize him when he gets back home.
I'll interrogate him myself later.
Go.
- Intendant Bigot?
- Yes.
I've tried so hard to stop thinking about you ever since that day.
Love is all I long for.
But I can't give myself by half.
You're saying that to a man who wants to give you everything.
I've been thinking about you endlessly.
Whenever I close my eyes, I see you.
When I open them, I look for you.
What can I do to make you trust me?
Kiss me.
Still full of stars in my head.
Don't go any further, François.
Bigot's men have searched the house and left guards there.
It's a trap.
They've killed Jean-Baptiste.
- What?
- Stop, François.
You're out of your league.
They've made off with everything.
Your father's registers, the deeds, the lot.
You've got nothing left now.
You're a nobody.
You're a dead man.
You took a risk, warning me like this.
Why?
Maybe to remind myself what it's like to feel clean.
Go now.
Leave.
They said you're going to pursue the affair in Paris.
You have no time to lose.
Don't stay here a minute longer.
I beg you.
God bless you, François.
Goodbye.
Nothing has changed.
My plans for our life together and my love for you are just the same.
Let's go away and live together forever under a kinder sky.
Meet me at sunset tomorrow at Anse-aux-Foulons at the foot of the white cross.
Be very careful and don't tell anyone.
I love you, Marie-Loup.
What is it?
What's wrong, my child?
I need your help.
"My plans for our life together and my love for you are just the same.
Let's go away and live together forever.
Meet me at sunset tomorrow at Anse-aux-Foulons at the foot of the white cross.
I love you, Marie-Loup."
Well?
It's a letter that says farewell.
What?
It can't be.
There's a price on his head.
He says he must leave the country immediately.
But he can't go without me.
I told him I'd follow him to the ends of the earth.
You've read it wrong.
Look.
You know this word, my child.
"France."
He begs you to stay here for your daughter's sake.
He refuses to let you share a life of...
How does he put it?
"A life of pitfalls and dangers."
How does it finish?
Does he say he loves me?
He says you must forget him.
He doesn't want you to ruin your life for him.
All he asks you're not to tell anyone about this letter.
He's underlined it.
Look.
He's underlined it.
Pitfalls.
He'll come back.
I know he will.
I love him.
I love him so much.
How can I live without him?
What are you doing here?
Marie-Loup is being watched by the militia.
No need to tell you why.
She was afraid they'd follow her here, so she asked me to come.
She received your letter, but she can't go with you.
She has to think of her family, especially little France.
She begs you to not hold it against her.
No, that's impossible.
Please, Father, talk to her.
She trusts you.
She told me.
Look at me, for God's sake.
You know I can make her happy.
I'm sure you can, my son.
But you know Marie-Loup she goes her own way.
I can't make her change her mind nor can anyone else.
- I'm not leaving without her.
- They're looking everywhere for you.
She could be in danger through your stubbornness.
The militia.
I'm unarmed.
The courageous captain can shoot me down without risk.
Don't tempt me, Le Gardeur.
I'm not asking anything for myself, Xavier.
You're a man of honor.
See she isn't harassed.
You're a fine one to talk about honor.
Intendant Bigot honored you with his trust and you're plotting against him.
- Let's talk about your Bigot.
He's lining his pockets while soldiers are massacred for a cause that is lost.
Did you read the registers before handing them to Bigot?
I did.
It's the only reason you're still alive.
You were born on this land, Xavier, so were your men.
They will live here in grinding poverty till the end of their days.
Who deserves your loyalty?
Your superiors or your own people?
Save your fine speeches for your funeral.
How do you think you can resist the English if you can't even stand up to Bigot?
Get out of here.
But I warn you I'm not giving you a second chance.
Tell her...
Tell her I love her despite herself and despite myself.
I love her too despite herself despite myself.
Order.
Take heart my friends.
Tomorrow our brave general sets off for the New World.
Why, soldiers why should we be melancholy, boys?
Why, soldiers whose business it is to die?
To our glorious army and victory.
God bless our general.
- God save the king!
- God save the king!
God save the king!
Clear the way!
- Hold the line!
- Ready?
Number one, fire!
Ready, set, fire!
Number three, ready!
- Ready?
- Number three.
Fire!
Number one ready, sir.
My weak health has prevented me from visiting the savages in Canada.
But there is another reason.
The example of our nations fighting out there has made those savages almost as evil as we are.
Be that as it may I don't need to go there to see the obvious.
What is obvious, exactly?
You're talking about a country.
I see a continent.
France owns a large slice of it by treaty, I agree.
But tell me.
What is a possession worth if we can't defend it?
War is expensive, and war appalls me as I claim that men were made to learn from each other not kill each other.
The harsh truth is that Quebec isn't worth the bones of a single French grenadier.
You say nothing about the injustice suffered by the Canadians in this tragedy.
Isn't it the duty of all honest men to ensure that all injustices are brought to the ears of all the people?
You're turning my own words against me.
Your conduct should vex me but I find your impertinence stimulating.
Monsieur de Vaudreuil was quite right to suggest you meet Madame de Pompadour.
Would you like me to send her a note in your favor?
Oh, it's more than I ever expected.
- God bless you, monsieur.
- Don't bring him into this.
You might pay Jean-Jacques Rousseau a visit in the meantime.
Your tales about your stay with the noble savages will have him drooling at the mouth.
Charge it!
Priming.
- Ready to fire?
- Ready!
Fire!
Fire!
Marie-Loup.
Acoona!
Acoona!
France!
Come.
Acoona!
Come, my love.
Come.
Acoona!
Acoona!
Acoona!
Acoona.
What can I do to forget?
Don't even try.
If you forget her, that means she died for nothing.
I'd rather not think about her anymore.
Then it would stop hurting.
That's not the way it works.
How does it work?
You can keep Acoona alive in your heart.
That way you can talk to her and tell her how sad you feel.
Sometimes I feel angry with her.
You can tell her that too.
She'll understand.
I love it when we talk like this.
So do I.
When you were in my tummy you and I, we were the same.
And then, when you were born you became someone else.
Did I make you feel sad?
At first because I didn't know I could feel even closer to you like now.
I love you so much.
To be honest, monsieur, only yesterday I'd have lent half an ear to Monsieur de Vaudreuil's request.
But the news I received early this morning has thrown another light on your undertaking.
News from Canada, madame?
A defeat for our troops at the gates of Quebec.
And glory for General Wolfe.
Posthumous glory.
Apparently, he recited a poem on the battlefield.
- You're very silent.
- Yes.
I'm thinking of the people I left behind.
Waging two wars at once one in Europe and the other one in America.
People in Quebec may not realize it but the financial situation in France has been put under dire pressure with times as they are.
I'm sure it has.
I can't make head or tail of England's calculations.
They're spending more money tearing Canada from us by force than the colony will ever bring in.
And our spies inform us that they're preparing another attack.
Madame, it's not too late to save Nouvelle-France.
Military reinforcements are not the only solution.
There is another way that is just as crucial.
Dismiss the crooks and the bunglers governing the colony immediately.
Eliminate the bunglers from the positions of power.
Sheer genocide.
Seriously, monsieur I know for a fact that our garrison in Montreal can hold out indefinitely against English provocations.
The English.
For a long time, I believe they were Canada's main enemies.
They're the most visible, that's for sure which makes them the least dangerous.
I'm very grateful to you for pointing this out to me.
My compliments, madame.
My brothers and sisters my friends.
The war is over.
Governor Vaudreuil has signed the colony's surrender in Montreal.
The English have pledged their word to respect the inhabitants' rights to their property and their goods.
The Catholic religion may be worshipped freely and the inhabitants can gather in churches and receive the sacraments with nothing to fear.
In exchange the mission of the clergy is to promote good relations with the conquerors and respect for their authority.
Nouvelle-France is no more.
Francois
Aren't you going to bed?
I'm not sleepy.
Because of François?
Do you still talk to him?
In your heart, I mean.
No.
I've stopped talking to him.
I'm doing everything I can to forget him.
Doesn't seem to be working.
If I could go back inside your tummy all tiny again, I would.
Then, you'd never feel lonely anymore.
And we could start all over again.
Have we fallen out?
Why don't you come to warm my bed anymore?
Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, Maman.
He's not for us.
You don't seem to be in a party mood.
Here.
Something for you.
He needs looking after as well.
I don't like cats.
I know you still think of him.
You've lost your lover and I've lost my best friend.
He can't be alive anymore.
Otherwise, we'd have heard from him.
There's no other explanation.
Let me take care of you.
Marry me.
I'll talk to your father.
Say what you have to say, Xavier Maillard.
But I warn you, the pittance you earn pen-pushing for the English is not enough to support a family.
So if this is about my daughter, my answer is no.
You're right.
I'm going to ask you for her hand but your answer will be yes.
You drink and you live a wild life.
Giving you my daughter will disgrace my name.
Miller Carignan's reputation.
Tell me about it.
Bigot and his henchmen have been thrown into the Bastille.
Did you know that?
Your name has come up in several statements along with your associate, old Le Gardeur.
It would be a real shame if those documents started circulating in Quebec.
Right?
Times are hard my friend.
About her dowry it's not the moment to be greedy.
You're not gonna marry him, are you?
Life is hard in this country especially for a woman on her own.
You'll be leaving home in a few years' time.
Don't deny it, I know you will.
- But I don't wanna be on my own.
- But you'll be on your own with him.
You frighten me sometimes.
You're growing up too fast.
Not fast enough to stop you from doing something silly.
Marie Madeleine Joseph Suzanne Carignan do you take Xavier Thomas Maillard as your lawful wedded husband and promise to love cherish and obey him before God?
If you consent, say:
"I do."
Yes, I do.
God.
You're beautiful.
I've wanted you for so long, Marie.
And you knew it.
I'm capable of loving you truly.
And you, Marie are you willing to be mine forever?
If you want me, you'll have to make me yours first.
I was so afraid you'd forget me.
You made me lose count.
So the savages didn't keep you?
They can't be as stupid as they seem.
All that for the hog?
It's a good price.
Except you'll take half of it off me.
I must have been drunk when I signed that damn contract.
Keep the lot for all I care.
You drink too much.
We can't go on like this.
We must separate.
We should never have gotten married.
I don't love you.
I've never loved you.
We'll go and see the priest.
He'll understand.
Marie-Loup.
For the love of God what's happened?
- Don't touch me.
- Oh, no.
Calm down, Marie-Loup.
- Did Maillard do that?
- Surprised?
At least he didn't strike me in the back.
What do you mean?
He came to see me.
He's been looking everywhere for you.
He said you've refused him his rights for months.
Yes, I have.
He disgusts me.
- Conjugal duty is sacred, my child.
- I'm not your child!
Isn't your own sin mortal?
I've known you all my life.
You've baptized me.
But you took advantage of my ignorance.
You lied to me.
Lied blatantly.
Here!
In front of the altar!
Before God!
So he's come back.
Forgive me.
Forgiving you won't wipe out the harm you've done.
I want a separation and my share of the property back.
- You'll help me.
- I don't have that right.
Resign yourself, Marie-Loup.
Maillard has his faults, but he is your husband.
- You must obey and respect him.
- Go to hell, Father!
Father Blondeau lent it to me.
I can only understand half of it but that doesn't matter.
Just half makes me want to fly up and away.
Does it hurt?
I'm going to tell you a secret.
A real secret.
He's come back.
François?
He's asked me to go away with him and to bring you with us, if you like.
Why did he say that?
Of course I want to.
We'll meet him tomorrow.
Don't tell anyone.
Not even Grandma.
And pack your things.
We won't be back for a long time.
What about Xavier?
- Won't he stop us?
- François will cut through the woods.
We'll wait for him at L'Anse-aux-Rochers.
Well we'll wait for him here.
You'll never have the Carignan girl.
The wolves are all you're good for now.
You're dead meat!
Leave.
Now.
If you ever come back, I'll kill you.
You will never see your handsome lover again.
- Cuckold's honor.
- What did you say?
You heard me.
- Leave!
- Go away!
Go away!
Filthy little brat.
I hate you both.
You'll pay for this.
Marie-Loup?
It's me.
Mélodie.
So he was found dead in the stable with head wounds.
Blows from the horse's hooves, maybe.
- You weren't there?
- No.
Maillard was blind drunk yesterday.
You can see the result.
I was scared he'd start again so I came to spend the night here with my daughter.
I found this in your house.
I couldn't ask for your permission as you weren't there.
- It's his hair.
- It looks like it.
But if your husband died in the stable who brought this into the house?
That's what I'd like to know.
If it's not inconvenient for you, Monsieur Carignan I'll have the body brought here for the wake.
I've put her to bed.
We've got to do something.
The children have been shouting terrible things at her.
They even threw stones at her.
Mélodie.
Can you do me a favor?
Anything you like.
Go get my aunt at the hospice.
The nun, you know her.
Tell her I need her.
- It's urgent.
- Don't worry.
They say you slept with the devil to have me.
And that's just a start.
People are so cruel.
I love you.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
Come, my angel.
You'll be fine.
You'll see.
My poor child.
We've got to think about you now.
There are prayers against wickedness but I don't know any against stupidity.
They've turned on me as if I was a stranger.
- But I'm one of them.
- Oh, no, you're not.
You're from very different stock.
They've accused your father of killing your husband.
We've got to do something.
You have no right to do this.
He didn't do anything.
It was an accident.
Are you Marie, the late Xavier Maillard's widow?
You're charged with aiding and abetting your late husband's murder.
Carry on.
Make him see sense.
Because you're wearing their uniform, it doesn't mean you're not one of us.
No.
No.
No.
No.
I saw them leaving the mill at sunup.
Whom did you see leaving?
Him.
With her.
Even though they were hurrying so no one would see them.
You saw them leave together.
Then what?
I saw them come back, right after they'd done their dirty work.
Did you see the accused carrying out what you call "their dirty work"?
How could I?
I was in the mill.
The jury will disregard that last declaration of the witness.
Mademoiselle Grandjean, can you give us any facts to prove that the defendants intended to harm Monsieur Maillard?
Harm him?
They wanted to do him in.
The day before, Marie-Loup came around whining that her husband had beaten her up.
I heard him with my own eyes.
We got on all right.
I'm talking about an intimate relationship.
The groom, Dieudonné, says in his statement that he saw you, and these are his exact words:
"Do the beast with two backs in the barn, with Monsieur Maillard."
It was just to help him.
He thought he couldn't do it anymore because the witch had cast a spell on his private parts.
The witch?
What witch?
Over there!
The she-devil.
That's how she does it!
She stares at us with those white eyes of hers.
No.
No.
Stop her.
Don't...
Don't let her.
She sets my blood boiling!
Good God.
Thank you.
What for?
You asked to see me.
I came with the secret hope that you'd forgiven me.
Hope?
I have no more hope.
I'm ready to hear your confession.
Well, I'm not ready to confess.
It was an excuse to get you here.
Can I ask you to give this to the mother superior at the home?
It's for my daughter.
Nobody knows she's there.
You know how sensitive she is.
She must be kept away from all these horrors.
Confession is not the most important thing.
You just have to say you are sorry from your heart and I can give you your absolution.
You think I've killed him too.
That's not for me to say.
Thank God.
But why does your father refuse to speak?
His testimony could change everything.
If only you could make him see sense.
What does it mean, "Make him see sense"?
The less he says the better.
I'd rather he stay stubborn as a mule.
I don't understand you, Marie-Loup.
Good.
- Is that a prayer book, France?
- Yes, aunt.
Read me one, then.
"She was from a world where the greatest beauty has the harshest destiny.
She was a rose, living like a rose for a brief morning."
That's not really a prayer.
Yes, aunt.
When God hears that, it makes him think.
He's not the only one.
Here.
It's for you.
They claim that the victim's wounds were caused when his horse trampled on him.
It's possible, but highly unlikely.
In my opinion, the wounds were caused by a sharp instrument.
An ax, for instance.
François.
This is incredible.
I thought you were dead.
And you could be too, if your face is anything to go by.
I don't wanna bother you.
But to be quite honest I don't know anyone in Quebec now.
Can you help me?
- You still love her?
- Yes.
I still love her.
Yes.
Have you asked to see the judge?
Do you think he'd receive me?
I need someone to speak for me.
I know someone who could influence the court.
- Who?
- Gouverneur Murray.
But we must take you in hand first and we'll have to move fast.
You don't have much time left to help her.
We can't hear you.
Speak louder.
She came in and woke me up at dawn.
She said something bad had happened.
She wanted me to go and see.
You went to her house with her?
We went to see Maillard in the stables.
He was dead.
I'm sure of it.
But not cold.
And what did you do next?
We went back to the mill.
Marie-Loup was afraid people would think she'd killed him.
So she asked me to...
What?
Speak louder, please.
Did your daughter lead you to believe that she was responsible for the death of her husband?
I can't say.
I asked her:
"What really happened?"
And she said:
"He had it coming.
He got what he deserved."
One can never be too careful.
I understand you wanted to shed some light on a certain case.
Yes.
It's about Marie Carignan.
The woman is innocent.
Innocent?
Isn't that rather a contradiction in terms?
This will surprise you, contrary to popular opinion I don't believe the defendant is guilty.
And you're right.
Maillard and a man called Lavigueur ambushed me in the woods behind the mill.
I fought back and I left Lavigueur's body there with my dagger in his belly.
I wounded Maillard but he got away.
So I followed him and I finished him off in his stable.
You see.
Why wasn't the judge informed?
I've always wanted to know who this dagger belonged to.
Thank you.
Been looking for a reason to get you out of Quebec and now you've served me one up on a plate.
You deserve to go to the gallows with the wretch you're willing to sacrifice everything for.
A short spell in Salieres penal colony will help you think straight and forget her.
What happens to me doesn't matter.
You're a gentleman, Gouverneur Murray.
You can't hang a woman when she's innocent.
We brought peace when we got rid of the French.
We have the clergy to thank for part of it.
For reasons I don't know the Episcopal authorities are favorable to the witch being condemned.
The life of an illiterate little Canadian girl is a negligible price to pay for the Church's collaboration with the state policies, wouldn't you say?
Take him down!
- Guilty of the charge of murder.
Therefore, the court sentences her to be locked in an iron cage and hung by the neck at the close of day until she dies.
Silence in the court.
Does the accused have anything to say?
Yes, Your Honor.
My father spoke the truth.
I killed my husband, Xavier Maillard to put an end to his brutality.
May justice be done.
Why do you care so much?
This little peasant means nothing to you.
She has three days left to live.
She's confessed to her crime.
She only confessed after she's been tried and found guilty.
What did she have to gain by it?
Why break a silence that leaves room for doubt?
Feminine logic has never been one of my strong points, madam.
Nevertheless, I've disliked this trial from the start.
- I'm in a hurry to turn the page.
- Does that mean...?
Three minutes to say goodbye.
That's two minutes too many.
Put them down on my account, will you?
- No, Maman!
- France.
I beg you, Marie-Loup.
You'll die in a state of mortal sin.
For the love of God, my child confess.
I can't.
I can't.
Why did she refuse absolution?
Why?
But she's not here.
And no one can answer in her place.
No one.
I can.
Make one sound and I'll kill you.
So it was you, my poor child.
Now I can die knowing the truth.
Your mother protected you all the way to the gallows.
Pray to God to save a little place for me up there at her side.
Marie I hear your voice in the whisper of the wind the murmur of the river and the song of the birds.
You're in my heart forever.
The wonder will never fade.
Did you say something, Father?
No, nothing.
I talk to her too every day the good Lord gives us.
Marie-Loup!
My little Marie!
Marie-Loup?
Oh, thank you, my God.
- Thank you.
- No.
It is not Marie-Loup, Father.
Don't you recognize me?
I'm her daughter.
France.
France?
You got my note.
It was very selfish of me.
But the hope of seeing you again has kept me alive.
Thank God.
But first of all I don't want this falling into the hands of strangers.
Your poor mother wouldn't keep it at the time.
But I was to blame.
I know.
I have read it a thousand times.
Marie with the she-wolf's eyes.
Now that I have met you I've become my true self.
Before that I had a future.
Now I have a destiny.
Here.
1759.
Another life.
Another world.
A year when passions ran high.
I was only a child then, living in a country which in the eyes of history, was still in its infancy.
I had no idea that my country was about to be lost or that by the grace of God, I would survive.
This hostile, beautiful no man's land 10 times bigger than its mother country France.
The same France that was about to sell us for a handful of islands in the sun.
The English were preparing to attack where I was born and when the city of Quebec fell England would seize the keys to a new outpost of her empire.
That was our fate and this is our story.
François.
You're too late, my poor boy.
Your father's just died.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Tell me, Jean-Baptiste did my father leave you some money?
A modest amount but quite enough for me.
- I'm very grateful to him.
- I'll double it.
If you thank me, I'll half it.
Your father gave me instructions.
All the papers are ready and the notary is waiting for you to call on him.
There are a lot of accounts to go through.
We can't have your debtors taking advantage of the situation.
Jean-Baptiste, you're not only shaving me but you're boring me too.
That's quite enough, no?
Come here, you little savage!
Move!
Get away!
No!
Is that splendid decoration for your courage?
Or were you just trying to baptize her with your holy oil?
He's got a knife!
That's enough.
Carry on.
Go back to where you came from.
- You like her, huh?
- Yes.
Good.
Go now.
Madame.
For red blotches and broken veins, madame.
You took quite a risk, my lovely.
Is your sister always this reckless?
She's not my sister.
She's my mother.
But she's so young.
- I was married when I was 14.
- No.
I bet your husband has to keep his eyes open with a spirited girl like you.
He's watching me from on high.
A widow?
Already?
How sad.
Apparently, you have quite a few tricks up your sleeve.
Is there a cream for getting rid of the first wrinkles?
Not today, madame, but I can make you up a pot.
It's a miraculous remedy.
Payment in advance.
I have love potions too.
Has anyone ever told you what beautiful eyes you have?
Yes.
- What's your name?
- France.
François.
My compliments, mademoiselle.
And what's her name?
Marie Carignan.
But everyone calls her Marie-Loup.
It's because she can see in the dark.
You're a...
You're a brave woman.
That's not hard when the men are such cowards.
- All the men?
- There may be the odd exception.
I must admit though, I was scared to death.
That's what I mean.
Courage goes hand-in-hand with fear.
You're teaching her to read.
That's the best gift.
She deserves it.
Thank you.
To who do I have the honor of speaking?
François Le Gardeur, at your service.
- Marie Carignan.
- I know.
You're the miller's daughter.
- François Le Gardeur.
- Xavier Maillard.
I wasn't sure it was you, with all those stripes, minus your beard.
Thank you.
You arrived just in time.
You mean now, or earlier on?
It's done.
Let's have a drink.
Why didn't you tell him the priest was teaching me how to read?
Are you ashamed you don't know how to?
I'm ashamed for your grandfather.
He's never thought studying mattered.
Then I'm going to be more intelligent than you.
More educated than me.
Intelligence doesn't come from here.
It comes from here.
The only thing I care about, sweetie, is that you don't grow up ignorant.
Then you'll be truly free.
I love you, you know?
I always forget.
You'll have to keep telling me.
I love you.
I love you.
- Tell me again.
- I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you...
Don't tell me you've sunk to dabbling in the peasantry.
Bright young girls come to a penny in Quebec.
With all the polish to take their place in society.
Especially now, your heritage will attract them like flies.
Do you think any of those girls would have risked their lives for a savage?
You haven't changed.
I have a very important message for you.
Intendant Bigot wants to meet you.
Tomorrow night.
An invitation or an order?
Don't be too clever with him.
I warn you.
He has no time for braggarts.
That's too bad.
So the priest, he's coughing up yellow stuff.
And he's lost some more hair.
I'll tell you a secret.
Everyone thinks I'm his servant but I'm not.
He bought me.
From a captain in the West Indies.
- No.
You're having me on.
- Oh, I'm not complaining.
- Don't tell me he's never touched you.
- Never.
It's me who touches him when he needs a rub down there.
He says it helps him keep impure thoughts at bay especially when he sees you.
We're going to have a big storm.
I love that.
Go home, all of you.
You're attracting the evil eye.
You don't need to be three for God to listen to you.
Marie-Loup.
My little Marie-Loup.
Can you drop these in some boiling water?
I always knew you were special, even when you were 6.
I've loved you like a daughter, more than a daughter.
Calm yourself, Father.
The fever is making you delirious.
- I know.
- Marie-Loup.
Careful.
You and your late husband were married for several years but you only had one daughter.
What happened?
You didn't try to stop having a family, did you?
Gosselin was always in such a hurry.
God rest his soul.
He should have taken longer.
He never went in deep enough.
He never went deep enough?
- Yes.
- Calm.
Calm.
Calm yourself.
The night is for sleeping, François.
I never knew you were so hard-working.
Neither did I.
Tell me, Jean-Baptiste.
All those farms my father took the families he turned out of their homes and the wheelings and dealings with Intendant Bigot didn't that keep him awake at night?
Not to my knowledge.
He was a strong man.
No.
A hard man.
I'm going to have to pass.
I pass as well, I guess.
My friends "fell for your bluff," as the English say.
But I reckoned, you look too honest to be trusted.
Until the return match, young man?
Your father was luckier than you.
Luckier in cards.
Good evening.
- Gentlemen.
- Monsieur.
An inheritance like yours entails obligations as well as privileges.
Obligations with regard to you, monsieur?
To me and to the colony.
In both private and public interest.
For many years, we have called on your father's good offices for various transactions.
The most important was on the verge of completion when fate...
As soon as you've taken over the reins, we must tie up this affair.
Time is running out.
Do you mean the war, Monsieur Bigot?
Wars are won, my young friend, and peace is paid for.
Which is the most expensive?
And let's not forget that France has her wars in Europe.
So as far as the colonies are concerned...
But there's one colony that France will never abandon.
I only hope God agrees with you.
Rumor has it, that instead of losing Canada our good King Louis will use her as currency.
Everything can be negotiated, Monsieur Le Gardeur, even a country.
Good night, François.
Go.
Here is the minister now.
Good day, Mr. Pitt.
I always knew Mr. Franklin as the American colony's illustrious representative.
I had no idea he was a remarkable inventor too.
You can see both near and far with them.
Ingenious, what?
I was just pointing out to the general how I find what I see extremely worrying, both near and far.
My friend is exasperated by France's scheming.
He demands annexation of Canada by Britain.
Aren't we already at war over that very issue?
Precisely, general.
That is why we must continue the action your army began at Arcady over the entire territory.
We must rid ourselves of the Canadians and the savages for good.
By deporting them?
By having them swear allegiance to the crown of England.
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.
- But you don't need them, madame.
- Thank you.
Some days I do, some days I don't.
I had a very rejuvenating potion this morning, as it happens.
Let me do something about that.
- For you.
- No, I can't accept it.
Do as I say.
This is my house.
I'm giving the orders.
It's magnificent.
- But why?
- Because I'm your friend.
And also because I want you to come to the intendant's ball.
- So that's what this dress is for?
- You're so naive.
No, this is for everyday wear.
Wait.
This is for you.
But I keep all the memories still clinging to it.
I thought I heard voices.
An unexpected visitor.
A little wildcat I've taken under my wing.
You saw her at the market the other day.
Bigot's asked me to give her to him for the intendant's ball.
You're in a hurry to leave all of a sudden.
Bigot's lucky to have such an understanding mistress.
Do you often give him presents like that?
Whenever a pretty girl catches his eye.
But she still has to be interested in his advances.
That girl has quite a strong character.
Good.
He knows how to force them if they resist.
- I'm going.
- Oh, I could tell you some stories.
You impressed him last night and you're in his good books now after letting him win.
Good morning, Marie Carignan.
I recognized you from a distance.
Wasn't difficult.
I wasn't expecting to see you here.
Our paths must be destined to cross.
Our paths don't cross, monsieur.
They follow each other.
Did Mademoiselle de Roquebrune send you?
I wouldn't have gone there if I had known I'd see you again today.
But if I hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen you.
You're seeing me now.
What does it change?
A lot of things.
You make me want to look further ahead than the present moment.
You're very friendly with Intendant Bigot, apparently.
Why don't you tell him to stop looting our farms and bleeding us dry?
Tell him yourself.
You've been invited to the palace, haven't you?
A word of advice, if I may.
Don't go.
You obviously feel I don't fit in there.
You fit in Mademoiselle de Roquebrune's good books for sure.
Ever wondered why?
I'll ask her myself when I'll see her at the ball.
Please do.
People in town say you're a witch.
They're the first ones to come to me with a toothache.
Don't look after them.
That will teach them.
It wouldn't teach them anything.
You know, evil is one disease that can't be cured.
Let's go eat.
Grandmother's waiting.
Look.
Over there.
Oh, yes, in the undergrowth.
I see him now.
My God!
He's enormous.
Save me, Maman!
Welcome!
- Hi, Grandma.
- My dear.
Look.
I found you some sarsaparilla roots.
Oh, they're nice.
Thank you.
Hello, Father.
- Hello, Grandfather.
- Hi.
Haven't you forgotten something?
Bread is holy, my girl.
Don't you ever forget it.
Bless us, our Lord, and these, thy fruits that we are about to receive from thy bounty.
Aren't you going to make the sign of the cross, you little savage?
Don't start all that again, Father.
You know she hasn't been baptized.
She doesn't think the same way we do.
Leave her alone.
Those savages don't have souls until they're baptized.
Go and ask the priest if you don't believe me.
Anyway, he's got nothing to be proud of with that dirty Negress of his.
I hardly know you now, Father.
You rant and rave about everything.
You hate the savages.
You hate the Negroes.
You have no respect for anyone.
And what's worse, you think you're right about everything.
That's dangerous.
Everyone in this house is miserable.
Do you really want to isolate yourself?
Because you are doing just that.
We go through this farce every year.
You accuse us of robbing you, but how do you expect us to feed the army defending you from the English?
We know all about your scheming, Lavigueur.
You auctioned off my sow instead of feeding the army.
I know.
My brother was at the sale and he recognized her.
You should know that all sows look alike.
Same as assholes, sergeant.
Except that some are shittier than others.
Don't let him get away.
Hello, Monsieur Le Gardeur.
Hello, Marie-Loup.
Hello.
Shame on you, Basile Lavigueur!
- Good Lord.
He's really cured.
- Lf you don't want to go to hell go back to being a butcher.
- It's a miracle.
Stop persecuting the poor.
A witch's trickery, you mean.
I don't make the decisions, Father.
I'm only following orders.
Tell the Intendant Bigot for me that the local people have barely enough food to feed their own families.
He'll end up with a revolt on his hands.
Now go.
Go!
Let me through.
Let me through.
- Let me through.
- Go back home!
That's an order!
Or else there's going to be trouble.
You're lucky you're wearing a cassock, Father.
Otherwise, I'd show you what people get for challenging the authorities.
Hey, I'm not wearing a cassock.
Go ahead.
Show me.
You're very brave.
Monsieur de Vaudreuil?
Oh, pardon.
Monsieur le Gouverneur.
My name will do.
All titles are valueless in the house of the Lord who wore only a crown of thorns.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Nouvelle-France is in grave danger, Father.
Imminent danger.
You can defend Nouvelle-France.
The people here trust you.
Probably because I'm a born and bred Canadian, like them.
It's both my weakness and my strength.
A few months ago you asked me if I knew anyone you could trust.
I remember catching you off balance.
Since then, however, I've met a brave young man who has guts and a heart.
Really?
The Major General Wolfe who we put in charge of the army invading Canada.
America will be the center of world finance and commerce before very long.
That's a fact, not a prediction.
What is equally certain is we can only defend our interests by negotiating the annexation of Canada and the West Indies.
Negotiate?
We cannot negotiate an annexation.
It's weakness.
Annexation is won.
The French colonies stretch as far as Louisiana.
It's an insult.
No matter.
I have control of the river Saint-Laurent.
And the ships supplying the rebels are all being intercepted.
Not one will get through.
Not one.
Calm down, general.
Quebec must be taken before the river freezes.
I will take Louisburg and with your permission, I will take Quebec and Montreal.
If the city refuses to give in I will torch and shell it 24 hours a day.
I will burn their crops upstream and downstream.
I'll destroy the farms and livestock.
I will leave a trail of famine and devastation behind me.
Excuse me.
I think I need some air.
Excuse me, sir.
Monsieur Le Gardeur.
François Le Gardeur greetings.
You were recommended to me by a mutual friend Father Blondeau.
He sings your praises.
What do you want with me, monsieur?
I want you to go to Versailles and talk to Madame de Pompadour.
Me?
Go to Paris?
You went to university there, didn't you?
And read political sciences, what's more.
So you must know that France's foreign policy is run by the marquises.
How can I succeed where you have failed?
An emissary is more eloquent than letters and reports that get lost.
And what's more, it's high time that the born-and-bred Canadians took their destiny into their own hands.
When should I leave?
As soon as possible.
May I suggest you begin your mission by a visit to Geneva.
- Geneva?
- Ferney.
It's very close.
I think I can arrange a meeting for you with France's leading influence in the universe of ideas.
Voltaire?
But he's violently opposed to the Canadian cause.
Violently opposed, but not an enemy.
He'll listen to you intelligently.
And besides, he's one of La Pompadour's protégés which doesn't hurt.
Come.
I see your disdain for the peasantry has its exceptions.
Like your scorn for the aristocracy.
I hear you're getting on very nicely with Gouverneur Vaudreuil.
Did you give him some beaver pelts?
That would explain it.
Laugh if you like but there's nothing laughable about the situation.
We must talk, Xavier.
You know I trust you.
Come.
- You are beautiful.
- So are you.
Come.
I'll show you around.
He recognized you, and the dress too.
He won't have much difficulties separating one from the other.
What wonderfully wide eyes.
Perfect.
He saw you with your daughter the other day.
- I told him she was your sister.
- Why?
So you can play at being a pure young girl.
Nothing excites him as much as conquering virgin territory.
He's bored with colonialism.
It takes two to play.
Don't count on me.
Hoity-toity.
What a little miss.
I expected you to be grateful.
Don't disappoint me.
You should be honored instead of giving yourself airs and graces.
How naive I was ever to believe in your friendship, madame.
Don't be such a little idiot.
You won't get very far and you'll just make a fool of yourself.
I only want what's best for you, once Bigot's happy, of course.
I know him.
He'll handle the whole thing correctly so get what you can out of it.
He's capable of anything, even generosity.
I'd rather he saved his generosity for you.
I'll never let myself be treated like that.
Good.
He loves being stood up to.
One word of advice, though.
Don't use your nails or your teeth if you don't want them pulled out.
He can be cruel too.
We're here to enjoy ourselves, damn it.
I've got to talk to you about Bigot.
And documents I found concerning him among my father's papers.
What sort of documents?
Documents that could send him and the other conspirators to the Bastille for a very long time.
You're risking your head, spreading slander like that.
If my word isn't enough for you, come to my house and see for yourself.
Why didn't you talk to Gouverneur Vaudreuil about it as you're getting along so well?
I already have.
Mind you, any illusions he might have had about Bigot vanished ages ago.
There's a very good chance that I go to Paris on a confidential mission.
This is strictly between us.
François, you can count on my loyalty.
How could I forget that the Marquis de Vaudreuil has authority over Bigot.
Come.
You know where to take her.
Make sure she's ready for me.
I'm in no mood for foreplay.
I'll do my best.
But I warn you, she's rather stubborn, I'm afraid.
All the better.
Truss her up and I'll ram her.
Thank you.
Lucky girl.
Pardon me.
Sorry.
Your attention, please.
Look.
Look.
Guard?
Look.
Wonderful.
Scissors?
Scissors?
Bravo.
This is the way you thank me?
I've never been so humiliated in all my life.
Oh, I know, I should have listened to you.
No, your only mistake was not believing in my friendship.
Friendship, in exchange for what?
You're just like the rest of them.
It's all a game to you.
You really think so?
No, but I wish I did.
You probably think I've nothing to be proud about.
No.
I know I'm not important or influential, monsieur.
But I am my own person.
You're stronger than me.
Go on.
Make me.
I don't care.
And if you kissed me first would you care then?
No.
That would change everything.
You're bound to make me suffer sooner or later.
So we might as well get it over with.
Go right away.
Don't waste a minute.
Grab all his father's papers, the registers, bills, everything.
Shouldn't we arrest him?
He must still be around.
I don't want any scandals here.
The papers first.
As for your friend, seize him when he gets back home.
I'll interrogate him myself later.
Go.
- Intendant Bigot?
- Yes.
I've tried so hard to stop thinking about you ever since that day.
Love is all I long for.
But I can't give myself by half.
You're saying that to a man who wants to give you everything.
I've been thinking about you endlessly.
Whenever I close my eyes, I see you.
When I open them, I look for you.
What can I do to make you trust me?
Kiss me.
Still full of stars in my head.
Don't go any further, François.
Bigot's men have searched the house and left guards there.
It's a trap.
They've killed Jean-Baptiste.
- What?
- Stop, François.
You're out of your league.
They've made off with everything.
Your father's registers, the deeds, the lot.
You've got nothing left now.
You're a nobody.
You're a dead man.
You took a risk, warning me like this.
Why?
Maybe to remind myself what it's like to feel clean.
Go now.
Leave.
They said you're going to pursue the affair in Paris.
You have no time to lose.
Don't stay here a minute longer.
I beg you.
God bless you, François.
Goodbye.
Nothing has changed.
My plans for our life together and my love for you are just the same.
Let's go away and live together forever under a kinder sky.
Meet me at sunset tomorrow at Anse-aux-Foulons at the foot of the white cross.
Be very careful and don't tell anyone.
I love you, Marie-Loup.
What is it?
What's wrong, my child?
I need your help.
"My plans for our life together and my love for you are just the same.
Let's go away and live together forever.
Meet me at sunset tomorrow at Anse-aux-Foulons at the foot of the white cross.
I love you, Marie-Loup."
Well?
It's a letter that says farewell.
What?
It can't be.
There's a price on his head.
He says he must leave the country immediately.
But he can't go without me.
I told him I'd follow him to the ends of the earth.
You've read it wrong.
Look.
You know this word, my child.
"France."
He begs you to stay here for your daughter's sake.
He refuses to let you share a life of...
How does he put it?
"A life of pitfalls and dangers."
How does it finish?
Does he say he loves me?
He says you must forget him.
He doesn't want you to ruin your life for him.
All he asks you're not to tell anyone about this letter.
He's underlined it.
Look.
He's underlined it.
Pitfalls.
He'll come back.
I know he will.
I love him.
I love him so much.
How can I live without him?
What are you doing here?
Marie-Loup is being watched by the militia.
No need to tell you why.
She was afraid they'd follow her here, so she asked me to come.
She received your letter, but she can't go with you.
She has to think of her family, especially little France.
She begs you to not hold it against her.
No, that's impossible.
Please, Father, talk to her.
She trusts you.
She told me.
Look at me, for God's sake.
You know I can make her happy.
I'm sure you can, my son.
But you know Marie-Loup she goes her own way.
I can't make her change her mind nor can anyone else.
- I'm not leaving without her.
- They're looking everywhere for you.
She could be in danger through your stubbornness.
The militia.
I'm unarmed.
The courageous captain can shoot me down without risk.
Don't tempt me, Le Gardeur.
I'm not asking anything for myself, Xavier.
You're a man of honor.
See she isn't harassed.
You're a fine one to talk about honor.
Intendant Bigot honored you with his trust and you're plotting against him.
- Let's talk about your Bigot.
He's lining his pockets while soldiers are massacred for a cause that is lost.
Did you read the registers before handing them to Bigot?
I did.
It's the only reason you're still alive.
You were born on this land, Xavier, so were your men.
They will live here in grinding poverty till the end of their days.
Who deserves your loyalty?
Your superiors or your own people?
Save your fine speeches for your funeral.
How do you think you can resist the English if you can't even stand up to Bigot?
Get out of here.
But I warn you I'm not giving you a second chance.
Tell her...
Tell her I love her despite herself and despite myself.
I love her too despite herself despite myself.
Order.
Take heart my friends.
Tomorrow our brave general sets off for the New World.
Why, soldiers why should we be melancholy, boys?
Why, soldiers whose business it is to die?
To our glorious army and victory.
God bless our general.
- God save the king!
- God save the king!
God save the king!
Clear the way!
- Hold the line!
- Ready?
Number one, fire!
Ready, set, fire!
Number three, ready!
- Ready?
- Number three.
Fire!
Number one ready, sir.
My weak health has prevented me from visiting the savages in Canada.
But there is another reason.
The example of our nations fighting out there has made those savages almost as evil as we are.
Be that as it may I don't need to go there to see the obvious.
What is obvious, exactly?
You're talking about a country.
I see a continent.
France owns a large slice of it by treaty, I agree.
But tell me.
What is a possession worth if we can't defend it?
War is expensive, and war appalls me as I claim that men were made to learn from each other not kill each other.
The harsh truth is that Quebec isn't worth the bones of a single French grenadier.
You say nothing about the injustice suffered by the Canadians in this tragedy.
Isn't it the duty of all honest men to ensure that all injustices are brought to the ears of all the people?
You're turning my own words against me.
Your conduct should vex me but I find your impertinence stimulating.
Monsieur de Vaudreuil was quite right to suggest you meet Madame de Pompadour.
Would you like me to send her a note in your favor?
Oh, it's more than I ever expected.
- God bless you, monsieur.
- Don't bring him into this.
You might pay Jean-Jacques Rousseau a visit in the meantime.
Your tales about your stay with the noble savages will have him drooling at the mouth.
Charge it!
Priming.
- Ready to fire?
- Ready!
Fire!
Fire!
Marie-Loup.
Acoona!
Acoona!
France!
Come.
Acoona!
Come, my love.
Come.
Acoona!
Acoona!
Acoona!
Acoona.
What can I do to forget?
Don't even try.
If you forget her, that means she died for nothing.
I'd rather not think about her anymore.
Then it would stop hurting.
That's not the way it works.
How does it work?
You can keep Acoona alive in your heart.
That way you can talk to her and tell her how sad you feel.
Sometimes I feel angry with her.
You can tell her that too.
She'll understand.
I love it when we talk like this.
So do I.
When you were in my tummy you and I, we were the same.
And then, when you were born you became someone else.
Did I make you feel sad?
At first because I didn't know I could feel even closer to you like now.
I love you so much.
To be honest, monsieur, only yesterday I'd have lent half an ear to Monsieur de Vaudreuil's request.
But the news I received early this morning has thrown another light on your undertaking.
News from Canada, madame?
A defeat for our troops at the gates of Quebec.
And glory for General Wolfe.
Posthumous glory.
Apparently, he recited a poem on the battlefield.
- You're very silent.
- Yes.
I'm thinking of the people I left behind.
Waging two wars at once one in Europe and the other one in America.
People in Quebec may not realize it but the financial situation in France has been put under dire pressure with times as they are.
I'm sure it has.
I can't make head or tail of England's calculations.
They're spending more money tearing Canada from us by force than the colony will ever bring in.
And our spies inform us that they're preparing another attack.
Madame, it's not too late to save Nouvelle-France.
Military reinforcements are not the only solution.
There is another way that is just as crucial.
Dismiss the crooks and the bunglers governing the colony immediately.
Eliminate the bunglers from the positions of power.
Sheer genocide.
Seriously, monsieur I know for a fact that our garrison in Montreal can hold out indefinitely against English provocations.
The English.
For a long time, I believe they were Canada's main enemies.
They're the most visible, that's for sure which makes them the least dangerous.
I'm very grateful to you for pointing this out to me.
My compliments, madame.
My brothers and sisters my friends.
The war is over.
Governor Vaudreuil has signed the colony's surrender in Montreal.
The English have pledged their word to respect the inhabitants' rights to their property and their goods.
The Catholic religion may be worshipped freely and the inhabitants can gather in churches and receive the sacraments with nothing to fear.
In exchange the mission of the clergy is to promote good relations with the conquerors and respect for their authority.
Nouvelle-France is no more.
Francois
Aren't you going to bed?
I'm not sleepy.
Because of François?
Do you still talk to him?
In your heart, I mean.
No.
I've stopped talking to him.
I'm doing everything I can to forget him.
Doesn't seem to be working.
If I could go back inside your tummy all tiny again, I would.
Then, you'd never feel lonely anymore.
And we could start all over again.
Have we fallen out?
Why don't you come to warm my bed anymore?
Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, Maman.
He's not for us.
You don't seem to be in a party mood.
Here.
Something for you.
He needs looking after as well.
I don't like cats.
I know you still think of him.
You've lost your lover and I've lost my best friend.
He can't be alive anymore.
Otherwise, we'd have heard from him.
There's no other explanation.
Let me take care of you.
Marry me.
I'll talk to your father.
Say what you have to say, Xavier Maillard.
But I warn you, the pittance you earn pen-pushing for the English is not enough to support a family.
So if this is about my daughter, my answer is no.
You're right.
I'm going to ask you for her hand but your answer will be yes.
You drink and you live a wild life.
Giving you my daughter will disgrace my name.
Miller Carignan's reputation.
Tell me about it.
Bigot and his henchmen have been thrown into the Bastille.
Did you know that?
Your name has come up in several statements along with your associate, old Le Gardeur.
It would be a real shame if those documents started circulating in Quebec.
Right?
Times are hard my friend.
About her dowry it's not the moment to be greedy.
You're not gonna marry him, are you?
Life is hard in this country especially for a woman on her own.
You'll be leaving home in a few years' time.
Don't deny it, I know you will.
- But I don't wanna be on my own.
- But you'll be on your own with him.
You frighten me sometimes.
You're growing up too fast.
Not fast enough to stop you from doing something silly.
Marie Madeleine Joseph Suzanne Carignan do you take Xavier Thomas Maillard as your lawful wedded husband and promise to love cherish and obey him before God?
If you consent, say:
"I do."
Yes, I do.
God.
You're beautiful.
I've wanted you for so long, Marie.
And you knew it.
I'm capable of loving you truly.
And you, Marie are you willing to be mine forever?
If you want me, you'll have to make me yours first.
I was so afraid you'd forget me.
You made me lose count.
So the savages didn't keep you?
They can't be as stupid as they seem.
All that for the hog?
It's a good price.
Except you'll take half of it off me.
I must have been drunk when I signed that damn contract.
Keep the lot for all I care.
You drink too much.
We can't go on like this.
We must separate.
We should never have gotten married.
I don't love you.
I've never loved you.
We'll go and see the priest.
He'll understand.
Marie-Loup.
For the love of God what's happened?
- Don't touch me.
- Oh, no.
Calm down, Marie-Loup.
- Did Maillard do that?
- Surprised?
At least he didn't strike me in the back.
What do you mean?
He came to see me.
He's been looking everywhere for you.
He said you've refused him his rights for months.
Yes, I have.
He disgusts me.
- Conjugal duty is sacred, my child.
- I'm not your child!
Isn't your own sin mortal?
I've known you all my life.
You've baptized me.
But you took advantage of my ignorance.
You lied to me.
Lied blatantly.
Here!
In front of the altar!
Before God!
So he's come back.
Forgive me.
Forgiving you won't wipe out the harm you've done.
I want a separation and my share of the property back.
- You'll help me.
- I don't have that right.
Resign yourself, Marie-Loup.
Maillard has his faults, but he is your husband.
- You must obey and respect him.
- Go to hell, Father!
Father Blondeau lent it to me.
I can only understand half of it but that doesn't matter.
Just half makes me want to fly up and away.
Does it hurt?
I'm going to tell you a secret.
A real secret.
He's come back.
François?
He's asked me to go away with him and to bring you with us, if you like.
Why did he say that?
Of course I want to.
We'll meet him tomorrow.
Don't tell anyone.
Not even Grandma.
And pack your things.
We won't be back for a long time.
What about Xavier?
- Won't he stop us?
- François will cut through the woods.
We'll wait for him at L'Anse-aux-Rochers.
Well we'll wait for him here.
You'll never have the Carignan girl.
The wolves are all you're good for now.
You're dead meat!
Leave.
Now.
If you ever come back, I'll kill you.
You will never see your handsome lover again.
- Cuckold's honor.
- What did you say?
You heard me.
- Leave!
- Go away!
Go away!
Filthy little brat.
I hate you both.
You'll pay for this.
Marie-Loup?
It's me.
Mélodie.
So he was found dead in the stable with head wounds.
Blows from the horse's hooves, maybe.
- You weren't there?
- No.
Maillard was blind drunk yesterday.
You can see the result.
I was scared he'd start again so I came to spend the night here with my daughter.
I found this in your house.
I couldn't ask for your permission as you weren't there.
- It's his hair.
- It looks like it.
But if your husband died in the stable who brought this into the house?
That's what I'd like to know.
If it's not inconvenient for you, Monsieur Carignan I'll have the body brought here for the wake.
I've put her to bed.
We've got to do something.
The children have been shouting terrible things at her.
They even threw stones at her.
Mélodie.
Can you do me a favor?
Anything you like.
Go get my aunt at the hospice.
The nun, you know her.
Tell her I need her.
- It's urgent.
- Don't worry.
They say you slept with the devil to have me.
And that's just a start.
People are so cruel.
I love you.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
Come, my angel.
You'll be fine.
You'll see.
My poor child.
We've got to think about you now.
There are prayers against wickedness but I don't know any against stupidity.
They've turned on me as if I was a stranger.
- But I'm one of them.
- Oh, no, you're not.
You're from very different stock.
They've accused your father of killing your husband.
We've got to do something.
You have no right to do this.
He didn't do anything.
It was an accident.
Are you Marie, the late Xavier Maillard's widow?
You're charged with aiding and abetting your late husband's murder.
Carry on.
Make him see sense.
Because you're wearing their uniform, it doesn't mean you're not one of us.
No.
No.
No.
No.
I saw them leaving the mill at sunup.
Whom did you see leaving?
Him.
With her.
Even though they were hurrying so no one would see them.
You saw them leave together.
Then what?
I saw them come back, right after they'd done their dirty work.
Did you see the accused carrying out what you call "their dirty work"?
How could I?
I was in the mill.
The jury will disregard that last declaration of the witness.
Mademoiselle Grandjean, can you give us any facts to prove that the defendants intended to harm Monsieur Maillard?
Harm him?
They wanted to do him in.
The day before, Marie-Loup came around whining that her husband had beaten her up.
I heard him with my own eyes.
We got on all right.
I'm talking about an intimate relationship.
The groom, Dieudonné, says in his statement that he saw you, and these are his exact words:
"Do the beast with two backs in the barn, with Monsieur Maillard."
It was just to help him.
He thought he couldn't do it anymore because the witch had cast a spell on his private parts.
The witch?
What witch?
Over there!
The she-devil.
That's how she does it!
She stares at us with those white eyes of hers.
No.
No.
Stop her.
Don't...
Don't let her.
She sets my blood boiling!
Good God.
Thank you.
What for?
You asked to see me.
I came with the secret hope that you'd forgiven me.
Hope?
I have no more hope.
I'm ready to hear your confession.
Well, I'm not ready to confess.
It was an excuse to get you here.
Can I ask you to give this to the mother superior at the home?
It's for my daughter.
Nobody knows she's there.
You know how sensitive she is.
She must be kept away from all these horrors.
Confession is not the most important thing.
You just have to say you are sorry from your heart and I can give you your absolution.
You think I've killed him too.
That's not for me to say.
Thank God.
But why does your father refuse to speak?
His testimony could change everything.
If only you could make him see sense.
What does it mean, "Make him see sense"?
The less he says the better.
I'd rather he stay stubborn as a mule.
I don't understand you, Marie-Loup.
Good.
- Is that a prayer book, France?
- Yes, aunt.
Read me one, then.
"She was from a world where the greatest beauty has the harshest destiny.
She was a rose, living like a rose for a brief morning."
That's not really a prayer.
Yes, aunt.
When God hears that, it makes him think.
He's not the only one.
Here.
It's for you.
They claim that the victim's wounds were caused when his horse trampled on him.
It's possible, but highly unlikely.
In my opinion, the wounds were caused by a sharp instrument.
An ax, for instance.
François.
This is incredible.
I thought you were dead.
And you could be too, if your face is anything to go by.
I don't wanna bother you.
But to be quite honest I don't know anyone in Quebec now.
Can you help me?
- You still love her?
- Yes.
I still love her.
Yes.
Have you asked to see the judge?
Do you think he'd receive me?
I need someone to speak for me.
I know someone who could influence the court.
- Who?
- Gouverneur Murray.
But we must take you in hand first and we'll have to move fast.
You don't have much time left to help her.
We can't hear you.
Speak louder.
She came in and woke me up at dawn.
She said something bad had happened.
She wanted me to go and see.
You went to her house with her?
We went to see Maillard in the stables.
He was dead.
I'm sure of it.
But not cold.
And what did you do next?
We went back to the mill.
Marie-Loup was afraid people would think she'd killed him.
So she asked me to...
What?
Speak louder, please.
Did your daughter lead you to believe that she was responsible for the death of her husband?
I can't say.
I asked her:
"What really happened?"
And she said:
"He had it coming.
He got what he deserved."
One can never be too careful.
I understand you wanted to shed some light on a certain case.
Yes.
It's about Marie Carignan.
The woman is innocent.
Innocent?
Isn't that rather a contradiction in terms?
This will surprise you, contrary to popular opinion I don't believe the defendant is guilty.
And you're right.
Maillard and a man called Lavigueur ambushed me in the woods behind the mill.
I fought back and I left Lavigueur's body there with my dagger in his belly.
I wounded Maillard but he got away.
So I followed him and I finished him off in his stable.
You see.
Why wasn't the judge informed?
I've always wanted to know who this dagger belonged to.
Thank you.
Been looking for a reason to get you out of Quebec and now you've served me one up on a plate.
You deserve to go to the gallows with the wretch you're willing to sacrifice everything for.
A short spell in Salieres penal colony will help you think straight and forget her.
What happens to me doesn't matter.
You're a gentleman, Gouverneur Murray.
You can't hang a woman when she's innocent.
We brought peace when we got rid of the French.
We have the clergy to thank for part of it.
For reasons I don't know the Episcopal authorities are favorable to the witch being condemned.
The life of an illiterate little Canadian girl is a negligible price to pay for the Church's collaboration with the state policies, wouldn't you say?
Take him down!
- Guilty of the charge of murder.
Therefore, the court sentences her to be locked in an iron cage and hung by the neck at the close of day until she dies.
Silence in the court.
Does the accused have anything to say?
Yes, Your Honor.
My father spoke the truth.
I killed my husband, Xavier Maillard to put an end to his brutality.
May justice be done.
Why do you care so much?
This little peasant means nothing to you.
She has three days left to live.
She's confessed to her crime.
She only confessed after she's been tried and found guilty.
What did she have to gain by it?
Why break a silence that leaves room for doubt?
Feminine logic has never been one of my strong points, madam.
Nevertheless, I've disliked this trial from the start.
- I'm in a hurry to turn the page.
- Does that mean...?
Three minutes to say goodbye.
That's two minutes too many.
Put them down on my account, will you?
- No, Maman!
- France.
I beg you, Marie-Loup.
You'll die in a state of mortal sin.
For the love of God, my child confess.
I can't.
I can't.
Why did she refuse absolution?
Why?
But she's not here.
And no one can answer in her place.
No one.
I can.
Make one sound and I'll kill you.
So it was you, my poor child.
Now I can die knowing the truth.
Your mother protected you all the way to the gallows.
Pray to God to save a little place for me up there at her side.
Marie I hear your voice in the whisper of the wind the murmur of the river and the song of the birds.
You're in my heart forever.
The wonder will never fade.
Did you say something, Father?
No, nothing.
I talk to her too every day the good Lord gives us.

GREG:
Everyone makes mistakes.
Hell, history's full of them.
Betamax, Waterworld, your brother who's 16 years younger than you.
- Tardy?
- Hi.
I'm not supposed to do this.
GREG:
There's really no shame in making mistakes... just as long as nobody knows about them.
You're Dottie Sunshine from Sweetknuckle Junction, right?
Hi.
I'm Leo Kornelly.
I work at Goodwill, remember?
You know, when you dropped off that box of old clothes.
You were the guy behind the counter who was doing all the funny impressions.
Yeah, when people give, I like to give back.
Anyway, the reason why I'm here... is you may have left something important in that box of junk.
That's so sweet.
You came all the way here and got past the guard just to give it to me?
Not exactly.
You see, what I found, imagine my surprise, was a tape of you.
[Whispering] It was a dirty tape.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
Please give it back to me.
If you were familiar with the rules of Goodwill... you would know that we can't return items or accept carpets or stoves.
- What do you want?
- You see, I'm an actor like you.
At least I've been trying to be for the last 12 years.
Check it out.
I can be serious.
I can be funny.
I slipped.
I can be a gondolier.
Would the nice lady like a pizza?
[Mumbling animatedly]
DOTTlE:
You're very good.
LEO:
I know.
So when I saw in the casting call... that your show was looking to add a singing mailman, I thought:
"What a coincidence!
You guys need a singing mailman...
"and I have your dirty tape!"
So you're blackmailing me to get a part on the show?
"Blackmail is such a dirty word." Jack Nicholson, Chinatown.
And yes, I am.
Look, I would love to help you out... but Sweetknuckle Junction is a network television show.
They don't just let anybody be on it.

TARDY:
I'm strong now.
[Tardy squeals]
- Hi, Dottie, I saw your hooters.
- What?
Those new guys playing your sidekicks on the Dottie Hears a Hoo sketch.
- Hello.
- Right.
OWL #2:
Nice melons.
OWL #1:
Juicy.
What is wrong with you people?
[Dottie crying]
- Are you okay, Dottie?
- Yes, Greg.
Go away!
You don't look okay.
Come on, what's wrong?
I can't tell you.
It's too embarrassing.
Is it more embarrassing than peeing your pants during a Little League game... then to hide it, you fall in a puddle, but nobody buys it... and everyone starts calling you Puddle Pants?
Yeah, it's more embarrassing.
Is it more embarrassing than seeing Nightmare On Elm Street... and you're so scared, you pee yourself, so you pour soda on it... but nobody buys it, and everyone changes your name... from Puddle Pants to Pepsi Pants?
Yes, Greg, it's more embarrassing!
GREG:
What's wrong?
This guy has a videotape of me doing something of an adult nature.
[Greg exclaims]
You mean like, sexual stuff?
No, it's me voting.
Yes, it's sexual.
He has a tape of me stripping and he's blackmailing me to get on the show.
Skatchamagowza, you were a G-string diva?
No, it was nothing like that.
I was young...
I was dating this really cool guy named Ira who went off to dental school.
Like many aspiring dentists of the day, Ira was really into M.C. Hammer.
So, one night, I set up a video camera... and I put on some genie pants... and I danced around seductively to U Can't Touch This... and then I took them off... and I touched it.
It's a tale as old as time.
I've got to get this guy on the show.
He said he'd put the tape on the lnternet and then everyone will see it.
I'm sure that if you just tell Mr. Bender what's going on--
No, I can't tell Gil, because then he'll tell Alison, and I'll get fired.
Oh, God.
And then my parents...
They can't find out.
This would kill them.
Let me talk to the rest of the cast.
Maybe they can help.
No, you've got to swear to me.
You can't tell anyone.
Okay, I swear.
[Popular '80s funk music]
alison:
Oh, my God.
Then instead of taking me home, as I asked him obviously to do... he takes me to his home.
Get it?
Like, his home.
Alison, sometimes I ask people "What's new?" just to be polite.
HAMSTER #1:
Moment of your time, please.
GlL:
What can I do for you fellas?
We're here on official union business.
The Loyal Brotherhood of Hamsters.
Local 146.
We're putting in a formal request.
We want a couch for our exercise wheel.
- Yeah.
- You want a couch for the wheel?
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, fellas.
There's no money in the budget for a couch.
Then you leave us no choice there, Bender.
- A shop steward for the hamsters.
- Local 146.
I'm calling for a work slowdown.
- Yeah.
- You guys can go slower?
That's for us to know... and you to--
Okay.
Bye, fellas.
Off you go.
[Hamsters grumbling]
By the way, I know about the gin in your suck nozzle.
HAMSTER #1:
I got your suck nozzle here.
HAMSTER #3:
Good one.
There you are, Gil.
I hear you're casting for a singing mailman.
Yeah, he delivers letters of the alphabet.
[Exclaiming and laughing]
- That's very inventive.
- Thank you.
- Did you think of that?
- No.
Anyway, you're not going to believe who I can get for this part.
When you think of Broadway, who do you think of?
Nathan Lane?
You can get Nathan Lane?
No, bigger.
Leo Kornelly!
Never heard of him.
He's been in everything.
He's huge.
He's got more Tonys than the mob.
[Drum roll]
Tardy, get off the drums.
- Drumsticks can also be chicken.
- Now.
I'll be honest.
I don't have time for a long casting session this week... so I'll take your word for it.
But this Leo better be great.
Great?
Before he was in The Fantasticks, it used to be called the Just Okays.
[Drum roll]
I'm a rock star.
GlL:
Tardy.
[Tardy squeals]
So where did this Leo guy come from?
He's been on Broadway.
You've heard of him, right, Greg?
Are you kidding?
Who hasn't heard of...
[Whispering] Leo Kornelly.
And by the way, guys, Leo is a little quirky.
He'd prefer it if you didn't talk to him too much.
Fine.
The last thing we need is a disgruntled singing postal worker.
If anyone's going to go nuts and kill everyone, it's going to be Jack.
There's some bad craziness out there.
I, for one, welcome my brother from the stage.
It will be nice to finally have a true actor... to help me carry the show's full dramatic weight.
Here's your banana for the Punky, the Chunky Monkey sketch.
Try not to eat it this time.
Well, that was unfortunate timing.
Apparently, Mr. Kornelly is here.
He's on his way in from Wardrobe.
So why don't we all take our positions for his dance number... and let's show him that we're professionals, too.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Hey, everybody.
[Drum roll]
[Leo exclaiming]
[Dottie exclaims]
[All sigh]
How about that entrance?
You like it?
I just made it up.
I found the crutches in the hallway.
[Gasping]
Could somebody help me, please?
Hey, Dottie.
- Gil Bender, Producer/Director.
- Hiya, Gil.
How are you doing?
Leo, Warren Demontague.
The pleasure is mutual.
I'm looking forward to our scene together.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I'm playing a mailman... why would I be doing a scene with a dog?
[All gasp in shock]
I, sir, am an actor first... a puppet second, and an ape third!
I am not a dog, but if I were, I would bite you thusly.
[All screaming]
WARREN:
That son of a bitch!
Yeah, he does that to all the guest stars.
WARREN:
I'm all right.
After Warren bit Robert Downey Jr.
he was high for two days.
And you are?
Jimmy.
I don't recall ever seeing you on the show.
No, I'm not an actor.
I'm a production assistant.
I do all the behind the scenes.
I work in the...
- Gil, who is that?
- That's our new mailman.
He's creepy.
He looks like a real mailman.
[Dottie chattering]
GlL:
Okay, places, everybody.
This is a rehearsal.
Now, remember, people, motivation.
GlL:
Greg?
GREG:
Yeah?
You wonder what the mailman has in store for you today.
[Greg murmurs]
Jack, you hope it's a bunch of letters and a zippity song.
Here we go.
Action.
GREG:
I wonder what the mailman has for us today.
Hopefully, a bunch of letters and a zippity song.
[Lively song]
[Singing] Hey, Mr. Mailman, what's in your sack?
Letters for Dottie, letters for Jack
I hand out letters That's what I do
I hand out letters to you, you, and you
I pass out letters from nighttime till noon
I make people happy as I yodel a tune
[Leo yodeling]
I don't know where this guy came from, but return to sender.
Because he's a mailman and he's bad.
[Singing] Wind and snow, sleet and hail
I sing a song, and I bring the mail
Or if you prefer I will lay down my rap
I'm so versatile I can also scat
[Scatting]
[Singing] Who's got the moves?
Me
Who's got the ankles and the knees?
Me
[Leo scatting louder]
I hope you guys were filming... because I don't think I can do it that good again.
[Bell rings]
GlL:
I don't believe it.
GlL:
Dottie said he was a big star on Broadway.
alison:
The only thing he's done on Broadway is sell crack.
You see?
You got to go in there and tell them the truth.
- I can't.
- Then they're going to fire Leo.
- No.
I've got a plan.
- I don't know.
Whatever it is, I don't think it's a good idea... unless of course it involves me getting dressed up in some disguise... preferably a sombrero.
Okay.
You guys, wasn't Leo great?
No, Dottie.
He was a pathetic hack.
It's hard coming into a new place... when he's surrounded by such talented actors.
Most of these people suck.
They only look good in comparison to him.
I mean it.
Most of you, you really do suck.
We're talking about Leo.
Fine.
But I've been meaning to bring it up for a while.
All right, where's Leo now?
The last I saw him, he was taking a fax machine out to his car.
I can't reach the pretzels.
I know Leo's horrible, but I need you guys to help me make sure...
- he doesn't get fired.
- Why?
I can't say.
Come on, you guys.
This is really important to me.
- Pretzels.
- Would you give him a freaking pretzel?
DOTTlE:
I'm begging you.
Help me convince Gil and Alison that Leo's got talent.
There's a such thing as artistic integrity.
Yeah, we're not going to sell out the show.
I'll take you all out for sushi.
[Exclaiming]
BLAH:
I suppose I could use a little spicy tuna roll.
DOTTlE:
Come on.
TARDY:
Pretzel!
Well, Dottie, thanks so much for stopping by.
Great job with Leo, incidentally.
Any other friends you want me to cast...
like a guy with no arms for the Patty-Cake sketch?
That's mine.
I just said that a minute ago.
No, you said something about a guy with no arms... to play Who's Got Your Nose?
which makes no sense to me at all.
Why doesn't that make sense?
Just because someone has no arms, you can still grab their nose.
No, it's the guy with no arms who is grabbing the nose.
Yeah, okay.
How much do you two get paid?
Anyway, I can guess why you're all here, and don't worry, we're firing Leo.
The guy stinks.
What are you talking about?
He's brilliant.
And I'm not the only one who thinks so.
Right, guys?
- Gil, the man is a genius.
- Clearly ahead of his time.
If he's ahead of his time, that doesn't do us any good now, does it?
He's only about three weeks ahead of his time... so by the time the show airs, he'll be perfect.
JACK:
Come on.
GlL:
You want him to stay?
Si, Señor Leo es muy taliente.
[Traditional Spanish music]
Fine, we'll keep him.
But when I bring the episode to the network and they hate it... we will have to recast and we'll be re-shooting everything this weekend.
Hold on.
I'm sorry.
I've got Pilates.
No, I've got time reserved at the kiln.
I was going to give flowerpots to all of you for Earth Day.
I will be spending the entire weekend up in wine country... which is what I call the room above my garage, so...
But it's worth it, right, guys?
I mean, it's just one weekend.
[All mumbling disappointedly]
DOTTlE:
Guys?
WARREN:
No.
Come on, guys.
That Frenchman is Greg.
Guys?
- Will you fire him or should I do it?
- No, it's my responsibility.
Let me write the note.
I'll have Jimmy slide it under his door.
[Dottie crying bitterly]
You're doing the right thing there, Gil.
The guy sucks.
[Popular '80s funk music]
- Leo, wait.
- I cannot believe they fired me.
They didn't even have the decency to do it to my face.
They just slipped a note under my door.
- What kind of people are these?
- Them?
You're a blackmailer!
I may be a blackmailer, but it's only because I wanted to be an actor so much!
At least I know I can leave here with dignity and class.
I will see you on the lnternet, lady.
All right, guys, I was sworn to secrecy, but I'm going to tell you anyway.
Leo is blackmailing Dottie... because he's a got tape of her stripping for her dentist boyfriend... to the tune of M.C. Hammer's U Can't Touch This.
WARREN:
This is rich.
GREG:
Guys, she needs our help.
Yeah, someone should do something.
Let's call the cops.
Maybe they'll do something.
We're a theater troupe.
Theater troupes take care of their own.
I say we find this M.C. Hammer and kill him.
Well, what are we waiting for?
To the Blahmobile.
Well, what are we waiting for?
To the Blahmobile.
Wait, I rode my bike today.
[Adventurous instrumental music]
Come on, Jack, hurry up.
We're going to lose him.
Yeah, we're going to lose that.
All right, men, let's get a weapons check.
- I've got a wrench.
- I got a rope.
I got a candlestick.
Guys, we're going to beat up Leo, not play Clue.
Let's focus.
We've got to be ready for everything.
- I'm scared.
- You have a cantaloupe, Tardy.
I feel better now.
There he goes.
He's pulling into that scuzzy motel.
WARREN:
I'm having total déjà vu.
That's right.
I bring whores here.
[Adventurous instrumental music continues]
BLAH:
All right, let's do this thing.
My brass knuckles.
[Jimmy mumbling]
WARREN:
Somebody hold my car keys, will you?
Little Green Bagby George Baker playing.
HAMSTERS:
We want a sofa.
Not Jimmy Hoffa.
HAMSTERS:
Hey!
Whoa!
If you want to get inside... you're going to have to try and cross our picket line.
Yeah.
[Hamsters shouting]
Gil, Alison, this is for you.
It's about what happened with Leo.
It's all in the letter.
I just wanted you to hear it from me.
I'm sorry.
- It's a letter of resignation.
- She's really upset.
She dotted her "l's" with frowny faces.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Tardy.
Ouch!
Someone knock and say he's the pizza man.
Pizza man?
Safety is at stake.
Careers are on the line.
This situation demands realism.
[Warren sniffs and clears throat]
[Knocking]
Room service.
LEO:
I didn't order-- WARREN:
Die, you bastard!
What the...
We came for Dottie's video and we're not leaving without it.
jimmy:
And it better be rewound.
GREG:
Yeah.
Okay.
Wow.
You guys really mean business, don't you?
Yes, we do, Leo.
Or shall we say M.C. Hammer?
So do I.
[Buzzing and crackling]
Oh, please.
I played the unscrupulous owner of a nursing home... in a very well-received episode of Diagnosis Murder... and I think I know a prop when I see one.
[Screaming]
And that is not a prop.
All right, you're all such great actors.
Why don't you act like you're putting your weapons down?
Jack, you were in Nam.
What do you do when someone points a weapon at you?
You spend three years in a bamboo cage.
Leo?
Guys, what are you doing here?
We came to get your tape back.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you came here to help me.
- I can't believe you told them.
- But--
You guys are so sweet.
You are so dead.
Could we just stop the chitchat?
What do you want?
I want to buy my tape back.
Here's all the money that I have and the pink slip to my car.
I'm not doing this for the money.
I've already got a cool car and a great place to live.
I'm doing this because I want to be in show business.
Maybe we can help.
DOTTlE:
Gil, Alison!
Look, Leo, give us the tape and we'll put you back on the show... and not just for an episode.
You can be a regular.
I ain't falling for that.
I want it in writing.
We thought you'd say that... so we brought a contract.
Let's see the tape.
Let's see the contract.
Back off!
Greetings from the Loyal Brotherhood of Hamsters!
Local 146.
Yeah.
[Screaming]
GREG:
So, everyone makes mistakes... but that's okay as long as you also make friends.
Friends will do anything for you... especially if they have friends who will do anything for a couch.
Thanks you, guys.
This means so much.
Don't even think about it, Warren.
Damn.
I was going to take it with me up to wine country.
Don't mind the writer.
I'm sure if I was an actor... everybody would be right in here to help me up.
Wouldn't you?
[Groaning]
I'm in pain.
Pain and ouch.
Hello.
Pain, man on the floor.
Man down.
There's a man down!
Does anybody see the braces here?
If I could walk, I wouldn't be here.
Hello, writer on the floor.
Is there nobody?
Hello?

Paris 1870
"Opera Populaire
"La Carlotta"
This trophy from our saviours,
From our saviours
From the enslaving force of Rome!
Madame
With feasting and dancing and song, tonight in celebration, we greet the victorious throng, returned to bring salvation!
Vicomte, welcome
The trumpets of Carthage resound!
Hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to our step on the ground!
Hear the drums
Hannibal comes!
Sad to return to find the land we love threatened once more by Roma's far-reaching grasp.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Rehearsals, as you see, are under way, for a new production of Chalumeau's 'Hannibal'.
M. Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
M. Reyer, Mme. Giry, ladies and gentlemen, please, if I can have your attention, thank you
As you know, for some weeks there have been rumours of my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you that these were all true, and it is my pleasure to introduce to you the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire, M. Richard Firmin and M. Gilles Andre.
I'm sure you've read that recent fortune in the junk business scrap metal, actually
He must be rich
And we're deeply honored to introduce our new patron, the Vicomte de Chagny
It's Raoul, before my father died,?
to see
I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts
He called me Little Lotte
Christine, he's so handsome
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts
Especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire
Gentlemen, Signora Carlitta Guidicelli our leading soprano for five seasons now.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honour, Signor.
I believe I'm keeping you for your rehearsal
I will be here this evening to share your great triumph
My apologies, monsieur
Thank you, M. Le Vicomte, once more if you please, Signor
He love me, he love me
He wouldn't recognize me
He didn't see you
If you please, monsieur
We take a particular pride in the excellence of our ballets, monsieur
I see why, especially that little blonde angel
My daughter, Meg Giry
And that exceptional beauty, no relation I trust
Christine Daae, promising talent M. Firmin, very promising
Daae, you say?
No relation to the famous Swedish violinist?
His only child, orphaned at seven when she came to live and trained in the ballet dormitories.
An orphan, you said?
I think of her as a daughter also
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side
Hannibals friends!
Oh no, not on my dress, why?
The trumpeting elephants sound - hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to their step on the ground - hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
Ah Daae, all that they want is your dancing
Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala
He's excited by dancing girls as your new managers
Because I will not be singing
Goodbye, everyone
Now it's finished
Get my doggie, bring my doggie.
Bye bye
What do we do?
- Grovel, grovel, grovel
- Right
See you later, because I'm going out
It is finished
Principessa.
Bella diva
- Si si
- Goddess of song
Mr. Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elisa in Act Three of 'Hannibal'?
Yes, yes, yes.
Ma no!
Because I have not my costume for act 3 because somebody not finish it!
And I hate my hat!
I wonder, Signora, as a personal favour if you would oblige us with a private rendition
Unless, of course, M. Reyer objects...
No.
Aspetta, aspetta.
If my managers command...
M. Reyer?
if My diva commands?
Yes, I do
Everybody be quite
Monsieur Lefevre, why exactly are you retiring?
My house I see
You as well
Signora?
Maestro.
Think of me, think of me, fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again
You long to take your heart...
Signora!
He's here:the Phantom of the Opera...
Signora!
Are you all right?
Buquet!
For God's sake, man, what's going on there?
Please, monsieur,don't look at me:
as God's my judge,I was not at my post.
Please, monsieur, there's no one there:
Or if there is, well then, it must be a ghost...
Signora, these things do happen.
For the past years, these things do happen
And did you stop them from happening?
No!
And you too, you are as bad as them, these things do happen
Until you stop these things from happening
This thing does not happen!
Ubaldo!
Andiamo!
Bring my doggy, and my boxy
Amateurs!
Now you see.
Byebye I'm leaving
Gentlemen.
Good luck.
If you need me, I should be in Australia.
Signora Guidicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?
You think so, monsieur?
I have a message, sir, from the Opera Ghost.
God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
He welcomes you to his opera house
His opera house?
And commands that you continue to?
leave Box Five empty for his use and reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Monsieur Lefevre used to give him twenty thousand francs a month.
Twenty thousand francs?
Perhaps you can afford more, with the Vicomte de Chagny as your patron.
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight when the Vicomte was to join us at the gala
But obviously we shall now have to cancel as it appears we have lost our star.
There should be a understudy
Understudy?
There is no understudy for La Calatta
A full house, Andre, we shall have to refund a full house.
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.
The chorus girl?
Don't be silly
She's been taking lessons from a great teacher.
Who?
I don't know his name, monsieur
Let her sing for you, monsieur.
She has been well taught.
Alright, come on, don't be shy, come on, come on
Just, just...
- From the beginning of the aria, mademoiselle
Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
She's very pretty
Think of me, think of me fondly, when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while - please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long to take your heart back and be free if you ever find a moment spare a thought for me...
We never said our love was evergreen,
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember,
Stop and think of me...
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen -
Don't think about the ways things might have been...
Think of me, think of me waking silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard to put you from my mind
Recall those days, look back on all those times
Thinks of the things, we'll never do
There will never be a day when I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seem so long ago,
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me, but I remember her
Flower fade, the fruit of summer fade
They have the season so do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me!
Bravo
Ma musica, splendide
"Gustave Daae"
Bravo, bravo, bravissimi
Christine, Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor
Meg
When your mother brought me here to live
Whenever I come down here alone
To light a candle for my father
A voice from above
And in my dreams
He was always there
You see, when my father lay dying
He told me I will be protected by an angel
An angel of music
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father tutored you?
who... who
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing, I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you are talking in riddles
And it's not like you
Angle of Music
Guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory Who is this angel
This...
Angle of Music
Hide no longer
Secret and strange and joy
He's with me, even now
Your hands are cold
All around you
Your face, Christine, is white
It frightens me
Don't be frightened
No, no
You did very well, my dear
He's pleased with you
Ah, Vicomte, I think we've made quite a discovery with Miss Daae
Perhaps we can present her to you, dear Vicomte
Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind, this is one visitor I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you
It would appear they've met before Yes
Little Lotte let her mind wander
Little Lottie thought:
Am I fonder of dolls or of goblins of shoes Raoul or of riddles of frocks
Those picnics in the attic or of chocolates
Father playing the violin
As we read to each other dark stories of the North
No - what I love best, Lottie said, is when I'm asleep in my bed and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
'
The Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
'
Oh, you're so like an angel tonight
Father said, 'When I'm in heaven, child
I will send the Angel of Music to you'.
Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I have been visited by the Angel of Music.
Oh, no doubt of it
- And now we'll go to supper!
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.
Well, I shan't keep you up late!
Raoul, no
You must change.
I'll order my carriage.
Two minutes
- Little Lottie.
No, Raoul, wait!
Insolent boy!
This slave of fashion basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool!
This brave young suitor, sharing in my triumph!
Angel!
I hear you!
Speak, I listen... stay by my side, guide me!
Angel, my soul was weak - forgive me... enter at last, Master!
Flattering child you shall know me, see why in shadow I hide!
Look at your face in the mirror -
I am there inside!
Angel of Music!
Guide and guardian!
Grant to me your glory!
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me:
Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
I am your Angel of Music Christine, Christine
Come to me:
Angel of Music
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear...
Your/My spirit and your/my voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
I have brought you to the seat of sweet music's throne to this kingdom where all must pay homage to music music
You have come here, for one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing,
I have needed you with me, to serve me, to sing, for my music... my music...
Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation.
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.
Silently the senses abandon their defences
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour.
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender.
Turn your face away from the garish light of day,
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light - and listen to the music of the night...
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams!
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before!
Close your eyes,let your spirit start to soar!
And you'll live as you've never lived before
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind, in this darkness that you know you cannot fight the darkness of the music of the night.
Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world!
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before!
Let your soul take you where you long to be!
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication!
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation!
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
Christine
Like yellow parchment is his skin...
A great black hole served as the nose that never grew...
You must be always on your guard, or he will catch you with his magical lasso!
Those who speak of what they know
Find, too late, that prudent silence is wise.
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I remember there was mist swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around, and on the lake there was a boat, and in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows
Whose is the face in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora!
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah!
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free!
Damn you...
Curse you...
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look or bear to think of me:
this loathsome gargoyle, who burns in bell, but secretly yearns for heaven, secretly...
Christine...
Fear can turn to love - you'll learn to see to find the man behind the monster:
this repulsive carcass, who seems a beast but secretly dreams of beauty, secretly...
Oh, Christine...
Come we must return
Those two fools Who run my theatre Will be missing you.
"Mystery after gala night,"
It says, "Mystery of soprano's flight!"
"Mystified all the papers say, we are mystified - we suspect foul play!"
Bad news on soprano scene -
First Carlotta, now Christine!
Still, at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold...
What a way to run a business!
Spare me these unending trials!
Half your cast disappears, but the crowd still cheers!
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hint!
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!
Andre, please don't shout...
It's publicity!
And the take is vast!
Free publicity!
But we have no cast...
Andre, have you seen the queue?
Oh, it seems you've got one too
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala!
Christine was in the world's sublime!
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left -
On that note the diva is a disaster must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime!
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder:
my salary has not been paid.
Send it care of the ghost, by return of post
P.T.O.:
No-one likes a debtor, so it's better if my orders are obeyed!"
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain!
These are both signed "O.G."...
Who the hell is he?
Opera ghost!
It's nothing short of shocking
He's mucking our position!
In addition he wants money
What a funny aberration to expect a large retainer!
Nothing plainer -he is clearly quite insane!
Where is she?
You mean Carlotta?
I mean Miss Daae -where is she?
Well, how should we know?
I want an answer -
I take it that you sent me this note
What's all this nonsense?
Of course not!
Don't look at us!
She's not with you, then?
Of course not!
We're in the dark...
Monsieur, don't argue -
Isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it, that we're meant to have wrote?
Written!
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again. "
If you didn't write it, who did?
Where is he?
Ah, welcome back!
Your precious patron - where is he?
What is it now?
I have your letter - a letter which I rather resent!
And did you send it?
Of course not!
As if he would!
You didn't send it?
Of course not!
What's going on?
You dare to tell me, that this is not the letter you sent?
!
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune, should you attempt to take her place. "
Far too many notes for my taste - and most of them about Christine!
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name...
Miss Daae has returned
I hope no words for as far as we're concerned
Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best that she was alone...
She needed rest
May I see her?
No, monsieur, she will see no-one.
Will she sing?
Here, I have a note...
Let me see it!
Please!
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature, detailing how my theatre is to be run.
You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance..."
Christine Daae has returned to you, and I am anxious her career should progress.
In the new production of "Il Muto", you will therefore cast Carlotta as the Pageboy, and put Miss Daae in the role of Countess.
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal.
The role of the Pageboy is silent - which makes my casting, in a word, ideal.
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in Box Five, which will be kept empty for me.
Should these commands be ignored, a disaster beyond your imagination will occur.
"I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, O.G."
Christine!
It's all a ploy to help Christine!
Whatever next...?
It's all about a ploy to help Christine
This is insane...
I know who sent this:
The Vicomte - her lover!
Indeed?
Can you believe this?
Signora!
O traditori!
This is a joke!
This changes nothing!
O mentitori!
Signora!
You are our star!
And always will be!
Signora...
The man is mad!
We don't take orders!
Miss Daae will be playing the Pageboy - the silent role...
Carlotta will be playing the lead!
It's useless trying to appease me!
You're only saying this to please me!
Signori, e vero?
Non, non, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!
Who scorn his word, beware to those...
You have reviled me!
The angel sees, the angel knows
You have rebuked me!
Signora, pardon us...?
You have replaced me!
Please, Signora, we beseech you...
This hour shall see your darkest fears...
Signora, sing for us!
Don't be a martyr
What new surprises lie in store?
Our star...!
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?
Miss Daae
Your public needs you!
We need you, too!
Would you not rather have your precious little ingenue?
Signora, no!
The world wants you!
Prima donna first lady of the stage!
Your devotees are on their knees to implore you!
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you!
Prima donna, enchant us once again!
Think of your muse...
And of the queues round the theatre!
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Christine spoke of an angel...
Prima donna, your song shall live again!
- Think of your public!
- You took a snub, but there's a public who needs you!
- She has heard the voice of the angel of music...
- Those who hear your voice liken you to an angel!
Think of their cry of undying support!
We get our opera
She gets her limelight!
Leading ladies are a trial!
Prima donna, your song shall never die!
You'll sing again, and to unending ovation!
- Orders!
Warnings!
Lunatic demands!
- Tears... oaths...
lunatic demands are regular occurrences!
Think how you'll shine in that final encore!
Surely there'll be further scenes worse than this!
Think, before these demands are rejected!
Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve a chorus girl, who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette, entwined in love's duet!
Although he may deny, he must have been with her!
You'd never get away with all this in a play, but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue it's just the sort of story audiences adore, in fact a perfect opera!
Prima donna the world is at your feet!
A nation waits, and how it hates to be cheated!
Light up the stage with that age old rapport!
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Oh, go go
They say that this youth has set my Lady's heart aflame!
His Lordship, sure, would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughing-stock!
Should he suspect her, God protect her!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
This faithless lady's bound for HADES!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
Serafimo - your disguise is perfect.
Who can this be?
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband.
That's exactly something the public loves
My love
- I am called to England on affairs of State, and must leave you with your new maid.
Though I'd happily take the maid with me.
The old fool is leaving!
That's the Countess de Cherbourg
She's invited us to her salon, you know
Nothing like that will endorse our junk business
Scrap metal
Serafimo - away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence!
Poor fool, he makes me laugh!
Haha,Haha...
Time I tried to get a better better half!
Poor fool, he doesn't know!
Hoho, Hoho...
If he knew the truth, he'd never, ever go!
Did I not instruct that Box Five was to be kept empty?
He's here: the Phantom of the Opera...
It's him
Your part is silent, little toad!
A toad, madame?
Perhaps it is you who are the toad...
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my...
Poor fool, he makes me laugh -
Hahahahaha!
?
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize, the performance will continue in ten minutes' time when the role of the Countess will be played by Miss Daae.
Until then, we will crave your indulgence for a few moments
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.
what?
Maestro, the ballet, bring, please
The ballet
The ballet, now, please
One moment, thank you
Thank you
You're fired
Are you alright?
Raoul, we're not safe here
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It was an accident... simply an accident
Why have you brought us here?
Don't take me back there!
We must return!
He'll kill me!
His eyes will find me there!
Christine, don't say that...
Those eyes that burn!
Don't even think it...
And if he has to kill a thousand men -
Forget this waking nightmare...
The Phantom of the Opera will kill...
This phantom is a fable...
Believe me...
... and kill again!
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
My God, who is this man who hunts to kill...?
...this mask of death...?
I can't escape from him...
Whose is this voice you hear I never will!
...with every breath...?
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind the Phantom of the Opera is here:
inside your/my mind...
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
Raoul, I've been there - to his world of unending night...
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness... darkness...
Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face in that darkness... darkness...
But his voice filled my spirit with a strange, sweet sound...
In that night there was music in my mind...
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard as I'd never heard before...
What you heard was a dream and nothing more...
Yet in his eyes all the sadness of the world...
Those pleading eyes, that both threaten and adore...
Christine...
Christine...
Christine...
No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears.
I'm here, nothing can harm you - my words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom, let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here with you, beside you, to guard you and to guide you...
Say you love me every waking moment, turn my head with talk of summertime...
Say you need me with you now and always...
Promise me that all you say is true that's all I ask of you...
Let me be your shelter, let me be your light.
You're safe:
No one will find you your fears are far behind you...
All I want is freedom, a world with no more night... and you, always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... let me lead you from your solitude...
Say you need me with you here, beside you... anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
Say you love me...
You know I do...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
Anywhere you go let me go too...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Come with me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!
And soon you'll be beside me!
You'll guard me, and you'll guide me...
I gave you my music... made your song take wing... and now how you've repaid me:
denied me and betrayed me...
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing...
Christine...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You will curse the day you did not do all that the Phantom asked of you...!
"Bal Masque"
M'sieur Andre?
M'sieur Firmin?
Dear Andre, what a splendid party!
The prologue to a bright new year!
Quite a night!
I'm impressed!
Well, one does one's best...
Here's to us!
The toast for the city
What a pity that 'Phantom' can't be here.
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade..
Masquerade!
Look around - there's another mask behind you!
Flash of mauve..
Splash of puce...
Fool and king...
Ghoul and goose...
Green and black...
Queen and priest...
Trace and rouge...
Face of beast...
Faces...
Take your turn, take a ride on the merry-go-round... in an inhuman race...
Eye of gold...
Thigh of blue...
True is false...
Who is who...?
Crul of lip...
Swirl of gown...
Ace of hearts...
Face of clown...
Faces...
Drink it in, drink it up, till you've drowned in the light... in the sound...
But who can name the face...
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Seething shadows, breathing lies...
Masquerade!
You can fool any friend who ever knew you!
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes...
Masquerade!
Run and hide - but a face will still pursue you!
What a night!
What a crowd!
Makes you glad!
Makes you proud!
All the creme de la creme!
Watching us watching them!
And all our fears are in the past!
Six months...
Of relief!
Of delight!
Of Elysian peace!
And we can breathe at last!
No more notes!
No more ghosts!
Here's a health!
Here's a toast: to a prosperous year!
To the new chandelier!
to the hear
And may its splendour never fade!
Six months!
What a joy!
What a change!
What a blessed release!
And what a masquerade!
Think of it!
A secret engagement!
Look - your future bride!
Just think of it!
But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me
No, Raoul, please don't do this
Well, let them see
It's an engagement, not a crime!
Christine, What are you afraid of?
Let's not argue...
Let's not argue...
Please pretend...
I can only hope I'll...
You will understand in time...
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade!
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade!
Masquerade!
Look around -
There's another mask behind you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera!
Here I bring the finished score
"Don Juan Triumphant"!
Fondest greetings to you all!
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts:
Carlotta must be taught to act, not her normal trick of strutting round the stage.
Our Don Juan must lose some weight - it's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age.
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office, not the arts.
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...
No doubt she'll do her best - it's true her voice is good.
She knows, though, should she wish to excel she has much still to learn, if pride will let her return to me
Her teacher, her teacher...
Your chains are still mine
You belong to me
Madame Giry.
Madame Giry...
Please, Monsieur, I know no more than anyone else.
That's not true.
Monsieur, don't ask, there have been too many accidents
Accidents?
Please, Madame Giry, for all our sakes...
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a travelling fair in the city.
Gypsies
I was very young, studying to be a ballerina
One of many
Living in the dormitory of the opera house
Come, come, come inside
Come and see the devil's child
?
the devil's child
Devil's child
Murder, murder
Which way?
...way
I have hidden him from the world and its cruelty is
He has known nothing else of life since then
Except this opera house
It was his playground and now his artistic domain
He's a genius, he's an architect and designer
He's a composer and a magician
A genius, monsieur
But clearly, Madame Giry, genius has turned to madness
Monsieur
Ou vas tu, mademoiselle?
The cemetery
To my father's grave, please
Where have they gone?
Oh, the cemetery
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing
Her Father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.
Her father promised her...
Her father promised her
You were once my one companion... you were all that mattered...
You were once a friend and father - then my world was shattered...
Wishing you were somehow here again... wishing you were somehow near...
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed, somehow you would be here...
Wishing I could hear your voice again... knowing that I never would...
Dreaming of you won't help me to do, all that you dreamed I could!
Passing bells and sculpted angels, cold and monumental.
Seem, for you, the wrong companions, you were warm and gentle.
Too many years fighting back tears, why can't the past just die!
Wishing you were somehow here again, knowing we must say goodbye!
Try to forgive, teach me to live!
Give me the strength to try!
No more memories, no more silent tears!
No more gazing across the wasted years!
Help me say goodbye... help me say goodbye!
Wandering child,
So lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father?
Friend or phantom?
Who is it there, staring?
Have you forgotten your Angel?
Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze
Wildly my mind beats against you
You resist
Yet your/the soul obeys...
Angel of Music!
You denied me/I denied you
Turning from true beauty
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protector
Come to me/your strange Angel...
I am your Angel of Music...
Come to me;
Angel of Music No, Christine, wait!
Wait!
Raoul!
Whatever you believe, this man - this thing - is not your father!
No, Raoul, no
Not like this
Now, let it be war upon you both!
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance
To ensnare our clever friend
We're listening...
Go on.
We shall play his game
Perform his work, but remember we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend
We are certain the doors are barred
We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end!
Raoul, I'm frightened...
Don't make me do this
Raoul, it scares me,
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me, I know
We'll be parted forever...
He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream, I now dread.
If he finds me, it won't ever end.
And he'll always be there, singing songs in my head...
He'll always be there, singing songs in my head...
You said yourself,
He was nothing but a man...
Yet while he lives,
He will haunt us 'til we're dead.
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse...
And yet, I wish I could
Oh God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me
In this, the Phantom's opera
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope, and every prayer rests on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin!
"Don Juan"
Here the sire may serve the dam, here the master takes his meat!
Here the sacrificial lamb utters one despairing bleat!
Poor young maiden!
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets you will have to pay the bill - tangled in the winding sheets!
Serve the meal and serve the maid!
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that, when tables, plans and maids are laid,
Don Juan triumphs once again!
Passarino, faithful friend, once again recite the plan.
Your young guest believes I'm you -
I, the master, you, the man
When you met you wore my cloak, she cannot see your face.
She believes she dines with me, in her master's borrowed place!
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff, stealing what, in truth, is mine.
When it's late and modesty starts to mellow, with the wine...
You come home!
I use your voice - slam the door like crack of doom!
I shall say: "come - hide with me!
Where, oh, where?
Of course - my room!"
Poor thing hasn't got a chance!
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword.
Conquest is assured, if I do not forget myself and laugh...
No thoughts within her head, but thoughts of joy!
No dreams within her heart but dreams of love!
Master?
Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for its prey...
You have come here in pursuit of your deepest urge, in pursuit of that wish, which till now has been silent, silent...
I have brought you, that our passions may fuse and merge - in your mind you've already succumbed to me dropped all defences completely succumbed to me - now you are here with me:
no second thoughts, you've decided,
decided...
Past the point of no return - no backward glances:
Our games of make-believe are at an end
Past all thought of "if" or "when" - no use resisting:
abandon thought, and let the dream descend...
What raging fire shall flood the soul
What rich desire unlocks its door
What sweet seduction lies before us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets
Will we learn beyond the point of no return?
You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech disappears
Into silence
Silence.
I have come here,
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent,
Now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided.
Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion-play has now at last begun.
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race
The sleeping bud burst into bloom
When will the flames at last consume us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return.
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you'll want me
With you here
Beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go too
Christine that's all I ask of...
Go!
Oh,?
You left before me
Oh my God
We'll run, Andre, run
Where did he take her?
Come with me, monsieur
I will take you to him
But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I'll go with you
No, Meg, you must stay here
Come with me, monsieur
No!
Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness, deep as hell
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin but the wickedness of my abhorrent face
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Hounded out by everyone
Met with hatred everywhere
No kind words from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine
Why, why...?
Your hand at the level of your eyes
This is as far as I dare go
Thank you
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
That fate, which condemns me to wallow in blood
Has also denied me the joys of the flesh...
This face, the infection which poisons our love...
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing
A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late
Turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this before your eyes
This haunted face holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies
Wait!
I think, my dear, we have a guest
Sir!
- Raoul!
This is indeed an unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped that you would come
And now my wish comes true
You have truly made my night!
Let me go!
Free her
Do what you like, only free her
Have you no pity?
Your lover makes a passionate plea
Please, Raoul, it's useless
I love her
Does that mean nothing?
I love her
Show some compassion
The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine...
Let me see her
Be my guest, sir...
Monsieur, I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay for the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes
Nothing can save you now, except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love!
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice,
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate,
Grow cold and turn to tears of hate
Christine, forgive me, please forgive me
I did it all for you, and all for nothing...
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered Too late for turning back, Too late for prayers and useless pity
Say you love him, and my life is over!
All hope of cries for help, No point in fighting
For either way you choose, You cannot win Either way you choose, he has to win
So do you end your days with me
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
Angel of Music...
Past the point of no return...
Christine say no!
Who deserved this?
Don't throw your life away for my sake!
The final threshold...
His life is now the prize which you must earn!
Why do you curse mercy?
I fought so hard to free you...
Angel of Music... you deceived me You've passed the point of no return!
I gave you my mind blindly
You try my patience,
Make your choice!
Pitiful creature of darkness,
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you,
You are not alone...
Track down this murderer, he must be found!
Take her, forget me,
Forget all of this...
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground!
Leave me alone - forget all you've seen...
Go now - don't let them find you!
Take the boat, swear to me, never to tell
The secret you know, of the angel in hell!
Go now - go now and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you...
Christine, I love you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You alone, can make my song take flight
It's over now, the music of the night
"Countess de Chagny Beloved wife and mother"
"Chrisine 1854-1917"
Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness
Who will be there for you
Comfort and care for you
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion
Never dreamed out in the world
There are arms to hold you?
You've always known
Your heart was on its own
So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone
Learn to be lonely
Life can be lived
Life can be loved
Alone.

Paris 1870
"Opera Populaire"
"La Carlotta"
This trophy from our saviours,
From our saviours
From the enslaving force of Rome!
Madame
With feasting and dancing and song, tonight in celebration, we greet the victorious throng, returned to bring salvation!
Vicomte, welcome
The trumpets of Carthage resound!
Hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to our step on the ground!
Hear the drums
Hannibal comes!
Sad to return to find the land we love threatened once more by Roma's far-reaching grasp.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Rehearsals, as you see, are under way, for a new production of Chalumeau's 'Hannibal'.
M. Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
M. Reyer, Mme. Giry, ladies and gentlemen, please, if I can have your attention, thank you
As you know, for some weeks there have been rumours of my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you that these were all true, and it is my pleasure to introduce to you the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire, M. Richard Firmin and M. Gilles Andre.
I'm sure you've read that recent fortune in the junk business scrap metal, actually
He must be rich
And we're deeply honored to introduce our new patron, the Vicomte de Chagny
It's Raoul, before my father died, at the house by the sea...
I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts
He called me Little Lotte
Christine, he's so handsome
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts
Especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire
Gentlemen, Signora Carlitta Guidicelli our leading soprano for five seasons now.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honour, Signor.
I believe I'm keeping you for your rehearsal
I will be here this evening to share your great triumph
My apologies, monsieur
Thank you, M. Le Vicomte, once more if you please, Signor
He love me, he love me
He wouldn't recognize me
He didn't see you
If you please, monsieur
We take a particular pride in the excellence of our ballets, monsieur
I see why, especially that little blonde angel
My daughter, Meg Giry
And that exceptional beauty, no relation I trust
Christine Daae, promising talent M. Firmin, very promising
Daae, you say?
No relation to the famous Swedish violinist?
His only child, orphaned at seven when she came to live and trained in the ballet dormitories.
An orphan, you said?
I think of her as a daughter also
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side
Hannibals friends!
Oh no, not on my dress, why?
The trumpeting elephants sound - hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to their step on the ground - hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
Ah Daae, all that they want is your dancing
Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala
He's excited by dancing girls as your new managers
Because I will not be singing
Goodbye, everyone
Now it's finished
Get my doggie, bring my doggie.
Bye bye
What do we do?
- Grovel, grovel, grovel
- Right
See you later, because I'm going out
It is finished
Principessa.
Bella diva
- Si si
- Goddess of song
Mr. Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elisa in Act Three of 'Hannibal'?
Yes, yes, yes.
Ma no!
Because I have not my costume for act 3 because somebody not finish it!
And I hate my hat!
I wonder, Signora, as a personal favour if you would oblige us with a private rendition
Unless, of course, M. Reyer objects...
No.
Aspetta, aspetta.
(No, Attesa, attesa)
If my managers command...
M. Reyer?
if My diva commands?
Yes, I do
Everybody be quiet
Monsieur Lefevre, why exactly are you retiring?
My health I see
You as well
Signora?
Maestro.
Think of me, think of me, fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again
You long to take your heart...
Signora!
He's here:the Phantom of the Opera...
Signora!
Are you all right?
Buquet!
For God's sake, man, what's going on there?
Please, monsieur, don't look at me:
as God's my judge, I was not at my post.
Please, monsieur, there's no one there:
Or if there is, well then, it must be a ghost...
Signora, these things do happen.
For the past years, these things do happen
And did you stop them from happening?
No!
And you two, you are as bad as them, these things do happen
Until you stop these things from happening
This thing does not happen!
Ubaldo!
Andiamo!
Bring my doggy, and my boxy
Amateurs!
Now you see.
Byebye I'm leaving
Gentlemen.
Good luck.
If you need me, I shall be in Australia.
Signora Guidicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?
You think so, monsieur?
I have a message, sir, from the Opera Ghost.
God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
He welcomes you to his opera house
His opera house?
And commands that you continue to?
leave Box Five empty for his use and reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Monsieur Lefevre used to give him twenty thousand francs a month.
Twenty thousand francs?
Perhaps you can afford more, with the Vicomte de Chagny as your patron.
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight when the Vicomte was to join us at the gala
But obviously we shall now have to cancel as it appears we have lost our star.
There should be a understudy
Understudy?
There is no understudy for La Carlotta
A full house, Andre, we shall have to refund a full house.
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.
The chorus girl?
Don't be silly
She's been taking lessons from a great teacher.
Who?
I don't know his name, monsieur
Let her sing for you, monsieur.
She has been well taught.
Alright, come on, don't be shy, come on, come on
Just, just...
- From the beginning of the aria, mademoiselle
Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
She's very pretty
Think of me, think of me fondly, when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while - please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long to take your heart back and be free.
If you ever find a moment, spare a thought for me...
We never said our love was evergreen,
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember,
Stop and think of me...
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen -
Don't think about the ways things might have been...
Think of me, think of me waking silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard to put you from my mind
Recall those days, look back on all those times
Thinks of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day when I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seem so long ago,
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me, but I remember her
Flower fade, the fruit of summer fade
They have their season so do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me!
Bravo
Magnifica!
Stupenda!
"Gustave Daae"
Bravo, bravo, bravissimi
Christine, Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor
Meg
When your mother brought me here to live
Whenever I come down here alone
To light a candle for my father
A voice from above
And in my dreams
He was always there
You see, when my father lay dying
He told me I would be protected by an angel
An angel of music
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father has tutored you?
who... who
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing, I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you are talking in riddles
And it's not like you
Angel of Music
Guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory Who is this angel
This...
Angle of Music
Hide no longer
Secret and strange angel
He's with me, even now
Your hands are cold
All around you
Your face, Christine, is white
It frightens me
Don't be frightened
No, no
You did very well, my dear
He's pleased with you
Ah, Vicomte, I think we've made quite a discovery with Miss Daae
Perhaps we can present her to you, dear Vicomte
Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind, this is one visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you
It would appear they've met before Yes
Little Lotte let her mind wonder
Little Lottie thought:
Am I fonder of dolls or of goblins or shoes Raoul or of riddles or frocks
Those picnics in the attic or of chocolates?
Father playing the violin
As we read to each other dark stories of the North
'No - what I love best', Lottie said, 'is when I'm asleep in my bed' 'and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
'
'The Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
'
Oh, you' sang like an angel tonight
Father said, 'When I'm in heaven, child'
'I will send the Angel of Music to you'.
Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I have been visited by the Angel of Music.
Oh, no doubt of it
- And now we'll go to supper!
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.
Well, I shan't keep you up late!
Raoul, no
You must change.
I'll order my carriage.
Two minutes, Little Lottie.
No, Raoul, wait!
Insolent boy!
This slave of fashion basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool!
This brave young suitor, sharing in my triumph!
Angel!
I hear you!
Speak, I listen... stay by my side, guide me!
Angel, my soul was weak - forgive me...
Enter at last, Master!
Flattering child you shall know me, see why in shadow I hide!
Look at your face in the mirror -
I am there inside!
Angel of Music!
Guide and guardian!
Grant to me your glory!
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
I am your Angel of Music Christine, Christine
Come to me:
Angel of Music
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear...
My/Your spirit and your/my voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
I have brought you to the seat of sweet music's throne to this kingdom where all must pay homage to music music
You have come here, for one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing,
I have needed you with me, to serve me, to sing, for my music... my music...
Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation.
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.
Silently the senses abandon their defences
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour.
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender.
Turn your face away from the garish light of day,
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light - and listen to the music of the night...
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams!
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before!
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar!
And you'll live as you've never lived before
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind, in this darkness that you know you cannot fight the darkness of the music of the night.
Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world!
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before!
Let your soul take you where you long to be!
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication!
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation!
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
Christine
Like yellow parchment is his skin...
A great black hole served as the nose that never grew...
You must be always on your guard, or he will catch you with his magical lasso!
Those who speak of what they know
Find, too late, that prudent silence is wise.
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I remember there was mist swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around, and on the lake there was a boat, and in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows
Whose is the face in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora!
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah!
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free!
Damn you...
Curse you...
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look or bear to think of me:
this loathsome gargoyle, who burns in hell, but secretly yearns for heaven, secretly...
Christine...
Fear can turn to love - you'll learn to see to find the man behind the monster:
this repulsive carcass, who seems a beast but secretly dreams of beauty, secretly...
Oh, Christine...
Come we must return
Those two fools Who run my theatre Will be missing you.
"Mystery after gala night,"
It says, "Mystery of soprano's flight!"
"Mystified all the papers say, we are mystified - we suspect foul play!"
Bad news on soprano scene -
First Carlotta, now Christine!
Still, at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold...
What a way to run a business!
Spare me these unending trials!
Half your cast disappears, but the crowd still cheers!
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hint!
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!
Andre, please don't shout...
It's publicity!
And the take is vast!
Free publicity!
But we have no cast...
Andre, have you seen the queue?
Oh, it seems you've got one too
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala!
Christine was in a word sublime!
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left -
On that note the diva is a disaster must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?
!
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder:
my salary has not been paid.
Send it care of the ghost, by return of post
P.T.O.:
No-one likes a debtor, so it's better if my orders are obeyed!"
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain!
These are both signed "O.G."...
Who the hell is he?
Opera ghost!
It's nothing short of shocking
He's mucking our position!
In addition he wants money
What a funny aberration to expect a large retainer!
Nothing plainer -he is clearly quite insane!
Where is she?
You mean Carlotta?
I mean Miss Daae -where is she?
Well, how should we know?
I want an answer -
I take it that you sent me this note
What's all this nonsense?
Of course not!
Don't look at us!
She's not with you, then?
Of course not!
We're in the dark...
Monsieur, don't argue -
Isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it, that we're meant to have wrote?
Written!
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again. "
If you didn't write it, who did?
Where is he?
Ah, welcome back!
Your precious patron - where is he?
What is it now?
I have your letter - a letter which I rather resent!
And did you send it?
Of course not!
As if he would!
You didn't send it?
Of course not!
What's going on?
You dare to tell me, that this is not the letter you sent?
!
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune, should you attempt to take her place. "
Far too many notes for my taste - and most of them about Christine!
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name...
Miss Daae has returned
I hope no worse for wear as far as we're concerned
Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best that she was alone...
She needed rest
May I see her?
No, monsieur, she will see no-one.
Will she sing?
Here, I have a note...
Let me see it!
Please!
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature, detailing how my theatre is to be run.
You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance..."
Christine Daae has returned to you, and I am anxious her career should progress.
In the new production of "Il Muto", you will therefore cast Carlotta as the Pageboy, and put Miss Daae in the role of Countess.
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal.
The role of the Pageboy is silent - which makes my casting, in a word, ideal.
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in Box Five, which will be kept empty for me.
Should these commands be ignored, a disaster beyond your imagination will occur.
"I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, O.G."
Christine!
It's all a ploy to help Christine!
Whatever next...?
It's all about a ploy to help Christine
This is insane...
I know who sent this:
The Vicomte - her lover!
Indeed?
Can you believe this?
Signora!
O traditori!
This is a joke!
This changes nothing!
O mentitori!
Signora!
You are our star!
And always will be!
Signora...
The man is mad!
We don't take orders!
Miss Daae will be playing the Pageboy - the silent role...
Carlotta will be playing the lead!
It's useless trying to appease me!
You're only saying this to please me!
Signori, e vero?
Non, non, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!
Who scorn his word, beware to those...
You have reviled me!
The angel sees, the angel knows
You have rebuked me!
Signora, pardon us...?
You have replaced me!
Please, Signora, we beseech you...
This hour shall see your darkest fears...
Signora, sing for us!
Don't be a martyr
What new surprises lie in store?
Our star...!
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?
Miss Daae
Your public needs you!
We need you, too!
Would you not rather have your precious little ingenue?
Signora, no!
The world wants you!
Prima donna first lady of the stage!
Your devotees are on their knees to implore you!
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you!
Prima donna, enchant us once again!
Think of your muse...
And of the queues round the theatre!
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Christine spoke of an angel...
Prima donna, your song shall live again!
- Think of your public!
- You took a snub, but there's a public who needs you!
- She has heard the voice of the angel of music...
- Those who hear your voice liken you to an angel!
Think of their cry of undying support!
We get our opera
She gets her limelight!
Leading ladies are a trial!
Prima donna, your song shall never die!
You'll sing again, and to unending ovation!
- Orders!
Warnings!
Lunatic demands!
- Tears... oaths...
lunatic demands are regular occurrences!
Think how you'll shine in that final encore!
Surely there'll be further scenes worse than this!
Think, before these demands are rejected!
Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve a chorus girl, who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette, entwined in love's duet!
Although he may deny, he must have been with her!
You'd never get away with all this in a play, but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue it's just the sort of story audiences adore, in fact a perfect opera!
Prima donna the world is at your feet!
A nation waits, and how it hates to be cheated!
Light up the stage with that age old rapport!
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Oh, go go
They say that this youth has set my Lady's heart aflame!
His Lordship, sure, would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughing-stock!
Should he suspect her, God protect her!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
This faithless lady's bound for HADES!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect.
Who can this be?
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband.
That's exactly something the public loves
My love, I am called to England on affairs of State, and must leave you with your new maid.
Though I'd happily take the maid with me.
The old fool is leaving!
That's the Countess de Cherbourg
She's invited us to her salon, you know
Nothing like that ever happened to us in the junk business
Scrap metal
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence!
Poor fool, he makes me laugh!
Haha,Haha...
Time I tried to get a better better half!
Poor fool, he doesn't know!
Hoho, Hoho...
If he knew the truth, he'd never, ever go!
Did I not instruct that Box Five was to be kept empty?
He's here, the Phantom of the Opera...
It's him
Your part is silent, little toad!
A toad, madame?
Perhaps it is you who are the toad...
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my...
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
Hahahahaha!
?
Bring the curtain in.
Please.
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize, the performance will continue in ten minutes' time when the role of the Countess will be played by Miss Daae.
Until then, we will crave your indulgence for a few moments
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.
what?
Maestro, the ballet, bring forth, please
The ballet
The ballet, now, please
One moment, thank you
Thank you
You're fired
Are you alright?
Raoul, we're not safe here
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It's simple an accident... an accident
Why have you brought me here?
We can't go back there!
We must return!
He'll kill you!
His eyes will find us there!
Christine, don't say that...
Those eyes that burn!
Don't even think it...
And if he has to kill a thousand men -
Forget this waking nightmare...
The Phantom of the Opera will kill...
This phantom is a fable...
Believe me...
... and kill again!
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
My God, who is this man who hunts to kill...?
...this mask of death...?
I can't escape from him...
Whose is this voice you hear I never will!
...with every breath...?
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind the Phantom of the Opera is there/here:
inside your/my mind...
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
Raoul, I've been there - to his world of unending night...
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness... darkness...
Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face in that darkness... darkness...
But his voice filled my spirit with a strange, sweet sound...
In that night there was music in my mind...
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard as I'd never heard before...
What you heard was a dream and nothing more...
Yet in his eyes all the sadness of the world...
Those pleading eyes, that both threaten and adore...
Christine...
Christine...
Christine...
No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears.
I'm here, nothing can harm you - my words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom, let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here with you, beside you, to guard you and to guide you...
Say you love me every waking moment, turn my head with talk of summertime...
Say you need me with you now and always...
Promise me that all you say is true that's all I ask of you...
Let me be your shelter, let me be your light.
You're safe:
No one will find you your fears are far behind you...
All I want is freedom, a world with no more night... and you, always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... let me lead you from your solitude...
Say you need me with you here, beside you... anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
Say you love me...
You know I do...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
Anywhere you go let me go too...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Come with me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!
And soon you'll be beside me!
You'll guard me, and you'll guide me...
I gave you my music... made your song take wing... and now how you've repaid me:
denied me and betrayed me...
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing...
Christine...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You will curse the day you did not do all that the Phantom asked of you...!
"Bal Masque"
M'sieur Andre?
M'sieur Firmin?
Dear Andre, what a splendid party!
The prologue to a bright new year!
Quite a night!
I'm impressed!
Well, one does one's best...
Here's to us!
The toast for the city
What a pity that 'Phantom' can't be here.
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade..
Masquerade!
Look around - there's another mask behind you!
Flash of mauve..
Splash of puce...
Fool and king...
Ghoul and goose...
Green and black...
Queen and priest...
Trace and rouge...
Face of beast...
Faces...
Take your turn, take a ride on the merry-go-round... in an inhuman race...
Eye of gold...
Thigh of blue...
True is false...
Who is who...?
Crul of lip...
Swirl of gown...
Ace of hearts...
Face of clown...
Faces...
Drink it in, drink it up, till you've drowned in the light... in the sound...
But who can name the face...
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Seething shadows, breathing lies...
Masquerade!
You can fool any friend who ever knew you!
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes...
Masquerade!
Run and hide - but a face will still pursue you!
What a night!
What a crowd!
Makes you glad!
Makes you proud!
All the creme de la creme!
Watching us watching them!
And all our fears are in the past!
Six months...
Of relief!
Of delight!
Of Elysian peace!
And we can breathe at last!
No more notes!
No more ghosts!
Here's a health!
Here's a toast: to a prosperous year!
To the new chandelier!
to the hear
And may its splendour never fade!
Six months!
What a joy!
What a change!
What a blessed release!
And what a masquerade!
Think of it!
A secret engagement!
Look - your future bride!
Just think of it!
But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me
No, Raoul, please don't do this
Well, let them see
It's an engagement, not a crime!
Christine, What are you afraid of?
Let's not argue...
Let's not argue...
Please pretend...
I can only hope I'll...
You will understand in time...
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade!
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade!
Masquerade!
Look around -
There's another mask behind you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera!
Here I bring the finished score
"Don Juan Triumphant"!
Fondest greetings to you all!
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts:
Carlotta must be taught to act, not her normal trick of strutting round the stage.
Our Don Juan must lose some weight - it's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age.
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office, not the arts.
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...
No doubt she'll do her best - it's true her voice is good.
She knows, though, should she wish to excel she has much still to learn, if pride will let her return to me
Her teacher, her teacher...
Your chains are still mine
You belong to me
Madame Giry.
Madame Giry...
Please, Monsieur, I know no more than anyone else.
That's not true.
Monsieur, don't ask, there have been too many accidents
Accidents?
Please, Madame Giry, for all our sakes...
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a travelling fair in the city.
Gypsies
I was very young, studying to be a ballerina
One of many
Living in the dormitory of the opera house
Come, come, come inside
Come and see the devil's child
?
the devil's child
Devil's child
Murder, murder
Which way?
...way
I have hidden him from the world and its cruelties
He has known nothing else of life since then
Except this opera house
It was his playground and now his artistic domain
He's a genius, he's an architect and designer
He's a composer and a magician
A genius, monsieur
But clearly, Madame Giry, genius has turned to madness
Monsieur
Ou vas tu, mademoiselle?
The cemetery
To my father's grave, please
Where have they gone?
Oh, the cemetery
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing
Her Father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.
Her father promised her...
Her father promised her
You were once my one companion... you were all that mattered...
You were once a friend and father - then my world was shattered...
Wishing you were somehow here again... wishing you were somehow near...
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed, somehow you would be here...
Wishing I could hear your voice again... knowing that I never would...
Dreaming of you won't help me to do, all that you dreamed I could!
Passing bells and sculpted angels, cold and monumental.
Seem, for you, the wrong companions, you were warm and gentle.
Too many years fighting back tears, why can't the past just die!
Wishing you were somehow here again, knowing we must say goodbye!
Try to forgive, teach me to live!
Give me the strength to try!
No more memories, no more silent tears!
No more gazing across the wasted years!
Help me say goodbye... help me say goodbye!
Wandering child,
So lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father?
Friend or phantom?
Who is it there, staring?
Have you forgotten your Angel?
Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze
Wildly my mind beats against you
You resist
Yet your/the soul obeys...
Angel of Music!
You denied me/I denied you
Turning from true beauty
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protector
Come to me/your strange Angel...
I am your Angel of Music...
Come to me;
Angel of Music No, Christine, wait!
Wait!
Raoul!
Whatever you believe, this man - this thing - is not your father!
No, Raoul, no
Not like this
Now, let it be war upon you both!
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance
To ensnare our clever friend
We're listening...
Go on.
We shall play his game
Perform his work, but remember we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend
We are certain the doors are barred
We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end!
Raoul, I'm frightened...
Don't make me do this
Raoul, it scares me,
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me, I know
We'll be parted forever...
He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream, I now dread.
If he finds me, it won't ever end.
And he'll always be there, singing songs in my head...
He'll always be there, singing songs in my head...
You said yourself,
He was nothing but a man...
Yet while he lives,
He will haunt us 'til we're dead.
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse...
And yet, I wish I could
Oh God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me
In this, the Phantom's opera
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope, and every prayer rests on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin!
"Don Juan"
Here the sire may serve the dam, here the master takes his meat!
Here the sacrificial lamb utters one despairing bleat!
Poor young maiden!
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets you will have to pay the bill - tangled in the winding sheets!
Serve the meal and serve the maid!
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that, when tables, plans and maids are laid,
Don Juan triumphs once again!
Passarino, faithful friend, once again recite the plan.
Your young guest believes I'm you -
I, the master, you, the man
When you met you wore my cloak, she cannot see your face.
She believes she dines with me, in her master's borrowed place!
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff, stealing what, in truth, is mine.
When it's late and modesty starts to mellow, with the wine...
You come home!
I use your voice - slam the door like crack of doom!
I shall say: "come - hide with me!
Where, oh, where?
Of course - my room!"
Poor thing hasn't got a chance!
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword.
Conquest is assured, if I do not forget myself and laugh...
No thoughts within her head, but thoughts of joy!
No dreams within her heart but dreams of love!
Master?
Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for its prey...
You have come here in pursuit of your deepest urge, in pursuit of that wish, which till now has been silent, silent...
I have brought you, that our passions may fuse and merge - in your mind you've already succumbed to me dropped all defences completely succumbed to me - now you are here with me:
no second thoughts, you've decided,
decided...
Past the point of no return - no backward glances:
Our games of make-believe are at an end
Past all thought of "if" or "when" - no use resisting:
abandon thought, and let the dream descend...
What raging fire shall flood the soul
What rich desire unlocks its door
What sweet seduction lies before us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets
Will we learn beyond the point of no return?
You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech disappears
Into silence
Silence.
I have come here,
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent,
Now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided.
Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion-play has now at last begun.
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race
The sleeping bud burst into bloom
When will the flames at last consume us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return.
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you'll want me
With you here
Beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go too
Christine that's all I ask of...
Go!
Oh,?
You left before me
Oh my God
We'll run, Andre, run
Where did he take her?
Come with me, monsieur
I will take you to him
But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I'll go with you
No, Meg, you must stay here
Come with me, monsieur
No!
Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness, deep as hell
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin but the wickedness of my abhorrent face
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Hounded out by everyone
Met with hatred everywhere
No kind words from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine
Why, why...?
Your hand at the level of your eyes
This is as far as I dare go
Thank you
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
That fate, which condemns me to wallow in blood
Has also denied me the joys of the flesh...
This face, the infection which poisons our love...
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing
A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late
Turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this before your eyes
This haunted face holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies
Wait!
I think, my dear, we have a guest
Sir!
- Raoul!
This is indeed an unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped that you would come
And now my wish comes true
You have truly made my night!
Let me go!
Free her
Do what you like, only free her
Have you no pity?
Your lover makes a passionate plea
Please, Raoul, it's useless
I love her
Does that mean nothing?
I love her
Show some compassion
The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine...
Let me see her
Be my guest, sir...
Monsieur, I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay for the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes
Nothing can save you now, except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love!
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice,
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate,
Grow cold and turn to tears of hate
Christine, forgive me, please forgive me
I did it all for you, and all for nothing...
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered Too late for turning back, Too late for prayers and useless pity
Say you love him, and my life is over!
All hope of cries for help, No point in fighting
For either way you choose, You cannot win Either way you choose, he has to win
So do you end your days with me
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
Angel of Music...
Past the point of no return...
Christine say no!
Who deserved this?
Don't throw your life away for my sake!
The final threshold...
His life is now the prize which you must earn!
Why do you curse mercy?
I fought so hard to free you...
Angel of Music... you deceived me You've passed the point of no return!
I gave you my mind blindly
You try my patience,
Make your choice!
Pitiful creature of darkness,
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you,
You are not alone...
Track down this murderer, he must be found!
Take her, forget me,
Forget all of this...
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground!
Leave me alone - forget all you've seen...
Go now - don't let them find you!
Take the boat, swear to me, never to tell
The secret you know, of the angel in hell!
Go now - go now and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you...
Christine, I love you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You alone, can make my song take flight
It's over now, the music of the night
"Countess de Chagny Beloved wife and mother"
"Chrisine 1854-1917"
Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness
Who will be there for you
Comfort and care for you
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion
Never dreamed out in the world
There are arms to hold you?
You've always known
Your heart was on its own
So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone
Learn to be lonely
Life can be lived
Life can be loved
Alone.

Paris 1870
"Opera Populaire"
"La Carlotta"
This trophy from our saviours,
From our saviours
From the enslaving force of Rome!
Madame
With feasting and dancing and song, tonight in celebration, we greet the victorious throng, returned to bring salvation!
Vicomte, welcome
The trumpets of Carthage resound!
Hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to our step on the ground!
Hear the drums
Hannibal comes!
Sad to return to find the land we love threatened once more by Roma's far-reaching grasp.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Rehearsals, as you see, are under way, for a new production of Chalumeau's 'Hannibal'.
M. Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
M. Reyer, Mme. Giry, ladies and gentlemen, please, if I can have your attention, thank you
As you know, for some weeks there have been rumours of my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you that these were all true, and it is my pleasure to introduce to you the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire, M. Richard Firmin and M. Gilles Andre.
I'm sure you've read that recent fortune in the junk business scrap metal, actually
He must be rich
And we're deeply honored to introduce our new patron, the Vicomte de Chagny
It's Raoul, before my father died, at the house by the sea...
I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts
He called me Little Lotte
Christine, he's so handsome
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts
Especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire
Gentlemen, Signora Carlitta Guidicelli our leading soprano for five seasons now.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honour, Signor.
I believe I'm keeping you for your rehearsal
I will be here this evening to share your great triumph
My apologies, monsieur
Thank you, M. Le Vicomte, once more if you please, Signor
He love me, he love me
He wouldn't recognize me
He didn't see you
If you please, monsieur
We take a particular pride in the excellence of our ballets, monsieur
I see why, especially that little blonde angel
My daughter, Meg Giry
And that exceptional beauty, no relation I trust
Christine Daae, promising talent M. Firmin, very promising
Daae, you say?
No relation to the famous Swedish violinist?
His only child, orphaned at seven when she came to live and trained in the ballet dormitories.
An orphan, you said?
I think of her as a daughter also
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side
Hannibals friends!
Oh no, not on my dress, why?
The trumpeting elephants sound - hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to their step on the ground - hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
Ah Daae, all that they want is your dancing
Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala
He's excited by dancing girls as your new managers
Because I will not be singing
Goodbye, everyone
Now it's finished
Get my doggie, bring my doggie.
Bye bye
What do we do?
- Grovel, grovel, grovel
- Right
See you later, because I'm going out
It is finished
Principessa.
Bella diva
- Si si
- Goddess of song
Mr. Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elisa in Act Three of 'Hannibal'?
Yes, yes, yes.
Ma no!
Because I have not my costume for act 3 because somebody not finish it!
And I hate my hat!
I wonder, Signora, as a personal favour if you would oblige us with a private rendition
Unless, of course, M. Reyer objects...
No.
Aspetta, aspetta.
(No, Attesa, attesa)
If my managers command...
M. Reyer?
if My diva commands?
Yes, I do
Everybody be quiet
Monsieur Lefevre, why exactly are you retiring?
My health I see
You as well
Signora?
Maestro.
Think of me, think of me, fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again
You long to take your heart...
Signora!
He's here:the Phantom of the Opera...
Signora!
Are you all right?
Buquet!
For God's sake, man, what's going on there?
Please, monsieur, don't look at me:
as God's my judge, I was not at my post.
Please, monsieur, there's no one there:
Or if there is, well then, it must be a ghost...
Signora, these things do happen.
For the past years, these things do happen
And did you stop them from happening?
No!
And you two, you are as bad as them, these things do happen
Until you stop these things from happening
This thing does not happen!
Ubaldo!
Andiamo!
Bring my doggy, and my boxy
Amateurs!
Now you see.
Byebye I'm leaving
Gentlemen.
Good luck.
If you need me, I shall be in Australia.
Signora Guidicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?
You think so, monsieur?
I have a message, sir, from the Opera Ghost.
God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
He welcomes you to his opera house
His opera house?
And commands that you continue to?
leave Box Five empty for his use and reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Monsieur Lefevre used to give him twenty thousand francs a month.
Twenty thousand francs?
Perhaps you can afford more, with the Vicomte de Chagny as your patron.
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight when the Vicomte was to join us at the gala
But obviously we shall now have to cancel as it appears we have lost our star.
There should be a understudy
Understudy?
There is no understudy for La Carlotta
A full house, Andre, we shall have to refund a full house.
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.
The chorus girl?
Don't be silly
She's been taking lessons from a great teacher.
Who?
I don't know his name, monsieur
Let her sing for you, monsieur.
She has been well taught.
Alright, come on, don't be shy, come on, come on
Just, just...
- From the beginning of the aria, mademoiselle
Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
She's very pretty
Think of me, think of me fondly, when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while - please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long to take your heart back and be free.
If you ever find a moment, spare a thought for me...
We never said our love was evergreen,
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember,
Stop and think of me...
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen -
Don't think about the ways things might have been...
Think of me, think of me waking silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard to put you from my mind
Recall those days, look back on all those times
Thinks of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day when I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seem so long ago,
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me, but I remember her
Flower fade, the fruit of summer fade
They have their season so do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me!
Bravo
Magnifica!
Stupenda!
"Gustave Daae"
Bravo, bravo, bravissimi
Christine, Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor
Meg
When your mother brought me here to live
Whenever I come down here alone
To light a candle for my father
A voice from above
And in my dreams
He was always there
You see, when my father lay dying
He told me I would be protected by an angel
An angel of music
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father has tutored you?
who... who
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing, I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you are talking in riddles
And it's not like you
Angel of Music
Guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory Who is this angel
This...
Angle of Music
Hide no longer
Secret and strange angel
He's with me, even now
Your hands are cold
All around you
Your face, Christine, is white
It frightens me
Don't be frightened
No, no
You did very well, my dear
He's pleased with you
Ah, Vicomte, I think we've made quite a discovery with Miss Daae
Perhaps we can present her to you, dear Vicomte
Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind, this is one visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you
It would appear they've met before Yes
Little Lotte let her mind wonder
Little Lottie thought:
Am I fonder of dolls or of goblins or shoes Raoul or of riddles or frocks
Those picnics in the attic or of chocolates?
Father playing the violin
As we read to each other dark stories of the North
'No - what I love best', Lottie said, 'is when I'm asleep in my bed' 'and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
'
'The Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
'
Oh, you' sang like an angel tonight
Father said, 'When I'm in heaven, child'
'I will send the Angel of Music to you'.
Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I have been visited by the Angel of Music.
Oh, no doubt of it
- And now we'll go to supper!
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.
Well, I shan't keep you up late!
Raoul, no
You must change.
I'll order my carriage.
Two minutes, Little Lottie.
No, Raoul, wait!
Insolent boy!
This slave of fashion basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool!
This brave young suitor, sharing in my triumph!
Angel!
I hear you!
Speak, I listen... stay by my side, guide me!
Angel, my soul was weak - forgive me...
Enter at last, Master!
Flattering child you shall know me, see why in shadow I hide!
Look at your face in the mirror -
I am there inside!
Angel of Music!
Guide and guardian!
Grant to me your glory!
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
I am your Angel of Music Christine, Christine
Come to me:
Angel of Music
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear...
My/Your spirit and your/my voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
I have brought you to the seat of sweet music's throne to this kingdom where all must pay homage to music music
You have come here, for one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing,
I have needed you with me, to serve me, to sing, for my music... my music...
Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation.
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.
Silently the senses abandon their defences
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour.
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender.
Turn your face away from the garish light of day,
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light - and listen to the music of the night...
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams!
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before!
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar!
And you'll live as you've never lived before
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind, in this darkness that you know you cannot fight the darkness of the music of the night.
Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world!
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before!
Let your soul take you where you long to be!
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication!
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation!
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
Christine
Like yellow parchment is his skin...
A great black hole served as the nose that never grew...
You must be always on your guard, or he will catch you with his magical lasso!
Those who speak of what they know
Find, too late, that prudent silence is wise.
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I remember there was mist swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around, and on the lake there was a boat, and in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows
Whose is the face in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora!
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah!
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free!
Damn you...
Curse you...
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look or bear to think of me:
this loathsome gargoyle, who burns in hell, but secretly yearns for heaven, secretly...
Christine...
Fear can turn to love - you'll learn to see to find the man behind the monster:
this repulsive carcass, who seems a beast but secretly dreams of beauty, secretly...
Oh, Christine...
Come we must return
Those two fools Who run my theatre Will be missing you.
"Mystery after gala night,"
It says, "Mystery of soprano's flight!"
"Mystified all the papers say, we are mystified - we suspect foul play!"
Bad news on soprano scene -
First Carlotta, now Christine!
Still, at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold...
What a way to run a business!
Spare me these unending trials!
Half your cast disappears, but the crowd still cheers!
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hint!
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!
Andre, please don't shout...
It's publicity!
And the take is vast!
Free publicity!
But we have no cast...
Andre, have you seen the queue?
Oh, it seems you've got one too
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala!
Christine was in a word sublime!
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left -
On that note the diva is a disaster must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?
!
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder:
my salary has not been paid.
Send it care of the ghost, by return of post
P.T.O.:
No-one likes a debtor, so it's better if my orders are obeyed!"
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain!
These are both signed "O.G."...
Who the hell is he?
Opera ghost!
It's nothing short of shocking
He's mucking our position!
In addition he wants money
What a funny aberration to expect a large retainer!
Nothing plainer -he is clearly quite insane!
Where is she?
You mean Carlotta?
I mean Miss Daae -where is she?
Well, how should we know?
I want an answer -
I take it that you sent me this note
What's all this nonsense?
Of course not!
Don't look at us!
She's not with you, then?
Of course not!
We're in the dark...
Monsieur, don't argue -
Isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it, that we're meant to have wrote?
Written!
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again. "
If you didn't write it, who did?
Where is he?
Ah, welcome back!
Your precious patron - where is he?
What is it now?
I have your letter - a letter which I rather resent!
And did you send it?
Of course not!
As if he would!
You didn't send it?
Of course not!
What's going on?
You dare to tell me, that this is not the letter you sent?
!
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune, should you attempt to take her place. "
Far too many notes for my taste - and most of them about Christine!
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name...
Miss Daae has returned
I hope no worse for wear as far as we're concerned
Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best that she was alone...
She needed rest
May I see her?
No, monsieur, she will see no-one.
Will she sing?
Here, I have a note...
Let me see it!
Please!
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature, detailing how my theatre is to be run.
You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance..."
Christine Daae has returned to you, and I am anxious her career should progress.
In the new production of "Il Muto", you will therefore cast Carlotta as the Pageboy, and put Miss Daae in the role of Countess.
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal.
The role of the Pageboy is silent - which makes my casting, in a word, ideal.
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in Box Five, which will be kept empty for me.
Should these commands be ignored, a disaster beyond your imagination will occur.
"I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, O.G."
Christine!
It's all a ploy to help Christine!
Whatever next...?
It's all about a ploy to help Christine
This is insane...
I know who sent this:
The Vicomte - her lover!
Indeed?
Can you believe this?
Signora!
O traditori!
This is a joke!
This changes nothing!
O mentitori!
Signora!
You are our star!
And always will be!
Signora...
The man is mad!
We don't take orders!
Miss Daae will be playing the Pageboy - the silent role...
Carlotta will be playing the lead!
It's useless trying to appease me!
You're only saying this to please me!
Signori, e vero?
Non, non, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!
Who scorn his word, beware to those...
You have reviled me!
The angel sees, the angel knows
You have rebuked me!
Signora, pardon us...?
You have replaced me!
Please, Signora, we beseech you...
This hour shall see your darkest fears...
Signora, sing for us!
Don't be a martyr
What new surprises lie in store?
Our star...!
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?
Miss Daae
Your public needs you!
We need you, too!
Would you not rather have your precious little ingenue?
Signora, no!
The world wants you!
Prima donna first lady of the stage!
Your devotees are on their knees to implore you!
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you!
Prima donna, enchant us once again!
Think of your muse...
And of the queues round the theatre!
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Christine spoke of an angel...
Prima donna, your song shall live again!
- Think of your public!
- You took a snub, but there's a public who needs you!
- She has heard the voice of the angel of music...
- Those who hear your voice liken you to an angel!
Think of their cry of undying support!
We get our opera
She gets her limelight!
Leading ladies are a trial!
Prima donna, your song shall never die!
You'll sing again, and to unending ovation!
- Orders!
Warnings!
Lunatic demands!
- Tears... oaths...
lunatic demands are regular occurrences!
Think how you'll shine in that final encore!
Surely there'll be further scenes worse than this!
Think, before these demands are rejected!
Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve a chorus girl, who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette, entwined in love's duet!
Although he may deny, he must have been with her!
You'd never get away with all this in a play, but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue it's just the sort of story audiences adore, in fact a perfect opera!
Prima donna the world is at your feet!
A nation waits, and how it hates to be cheated!
Light up the stage with that age old rapport!
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Oh, go go
They say that this youth has set my Lady's heart aflame!
His Lordship, sure, would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughing-stock!
Should he suspect her, God protect her!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
This faithless lady's bound for HADES!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect.
Who can this be?
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband.
That's exactly something the public loves
My love, I am called to England on affairs of State, and must leave you with your new maid.
Though I'd happily take the maid with me.
The old fool is leaving!
That's the Countess de Cherbourg
She's invited us to her salon, you know
Nothing like that ever happened to us in the junk business
Scrap metal
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence!
Poor fool, he makes me laugh!
Haha,Haha...
Time I tried to get a better better half!
Poor fool, he doesn't know!
Hoho, Hoho...
If he knew the truth, he'd never, ever go!
Did I not instruct that Box Five was to be kept empty?
He's here, the Phantom of the Opera...
It's him
Your part is silent, little toad!
A toad, madame?
Perhaps it is you who are the toad...
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my...
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
Hahahahaha!
?
Bring the curtain in.
Please.
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize, the performance will continue in ten minutes' time when the role of the Countess will be played by Miss Daae.
Until then, we will crave your indulgence for a few moments
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.
what?
Maestro, the ballet, bring forth, please
The ballet
The ballet, now, please
One moment, thank you
Thank you
You're fired
Are you alright?
Raoul, we're not safe here
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It's simple an accident... an accident
Why have you brought me here?
We can't go back there!
We must return!
He'll kill you!
His eyes will find us there!
Christine, don't say that...
Those eyes that burn!
Don't even think it...
And if he has to kill a thousand men -
Forget this waking nightmare...
The Phantom of the Opera will kill...
This phantom is a fable...
Believe me...
... and kill again!
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
My God, who is this man who hunts to kill...?
...this mask of death...?
I can't escape from him...
Whose is this voice you hear I never will!
...with every breath...?
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind the Phantom of the Opera is there/here:
inside your/my mind...
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
Raoul, I've been there - to his world of unending night...
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness... darkness...
Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face in that darkness... darkness...
But his voice filled my spirit with a strange, sweet sound...
In that night there was music in my mind...
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard as I'd never heard before...
What you heard was a dream and nothing more...
Yet in his eyes all the sadness of the world...
Those pleading eyes, that both threaten and adore...
Christine...
Christine...
Christine...
No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears.
I'm here, nothing can harm you - my words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom, let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here with you, beside you, to guard you and to guide you...
Say you love me every waking moment, turn my head with talk of summertime...
Say you need me with you now and always...
Promise me that all you say is true that's all I ask of you...
Let me be your shelter, let me be your light.
You're safe:
No one will find you your fears are far behind you...
All I want is freedom, a world with no more night... and you, always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... let me lead you from your solitude...
Say you need me with you here, beside you... anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
Say you love me...
You know I do...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
Anywhere you go let me go too...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Come with me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!
And soon you'll be beside me!
You'll guard me, and you'll guide me...
I gave you my music... made your song take wing... and now how you've repaid me:
denied me and betrayed me...
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing...
Christine...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You will curse the day you did not do all that the Phantom asked of you...!
"Bal Masque"
M'sieur Andre?
M'sieur Firmin?
Dear Andre, what a splendid party!
The prologue to a bright new year!
Quite a night!
I'm impressed!
Well, one does one's best...
Here's to us!
The toast for the city
What a pity that 'Phantom' can't be here.
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade..
Masquerade!
Look around - there's another mask behind you!
Flash of mauve..
Splash of puce...
Fool and king...
Ghoul and goose...
Green and black...
Queen and priest...
Trace and rouge...
Face of beast...
Faces...
Take your turn, take a ride on the merry-go-round... in an inhuman race...
Eye of gold...
Thigh of blue...
True is false...
Who is who...?
Crul of lip...
Swirl of gown...
Ace of hearts...
Face of clown...
Faces...
Drink it in, drink it up, till you've drowned in the light... in the sound...
But who can name the face...
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Seething shadows, breathing lies...
Masquerade!
You can fool any friend who ever knew you!
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes...
Masquerade!
Run and hide - but a face will still pursue you!
What a night!
What a crowd!
Makes you glad!
Makes you proud!
All the creme de la creme!
Watching us watching them!
And all our fears are in the past!
Six months...
Of relief!
Of delight!
Of Elysian peace!
And we can breathe at last!
No more notes!
No more ghosts!
Here's a health!
Here's a toast: to a prosperous year!
To the new chandelier!
to the hear
And may its splendour never fade!
Six months!
What a joy!
What a change!
What a blessed release!
And what a masquerade!
Think of it!
A secret engagement!
Look - your future bride!
Just think of it!
But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me
No, Raoul, please don't do this
Well, let them see
It's an engagement, not a crime!
Christine, What are you afraid of?
Let's not argue...
Let's not argue...
Please pretend...
I can only hope I'll...
You will understand in time...
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade!
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade!
Masquerade!
Look around -
There's another mask behind you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera!
Here I bring the finished score
"Don Juan Triumphant"!
Fondest greetings to you all!
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts:
Carlotta must be taught to act, not her normal trick of strutting round the stage.
Our Don Juan must lose some weight - it's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age.
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office, not the arts.
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...
No doubt she'll do her best - it's true her voice is good.
She knows, though, should she wish to excel she has much still to learn, if pride will let her return to me
Her teacher, her teacher...
Your chains are still mine
You belong to me
Madame Giry.
Madame Giry...
Please, Monsieur, I know no more than anyone else.
That's not true.
Monsieur, don't ask, there have been too many accidents
Accidents?
Please, Madame Giry, for all our sakes...
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a travelling fair in the city.
Gypsies
I was very young, studying to be a ballerina
One of many
Living in the dormitory of the opera house
Come, come, come inside
Come and see the devil's child
?
the devil's child
Devil's child
Murder, murder
Which way?
...way
I have hidden him from the world and its cruelties
He has known nothing else of life since then
Except this opera house
It was his playground and now his artistic domain
He's a genius, he's an architect and designer
He's a composer and a magician
A genius, monsieur
But clearly, Madame Giry, genius has turned to madness
Monsieur
Ou vas tu, mademoiselle?
The cemetery
To my father's grave, please
Where have they gone?
Oh, the cemetery
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing
Her Father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.
Her father promised her...
Her father promised her
You were once my one companion... you were all that mattered...
You were once a friend and father - then my world was shattered...
Wishing you were somehow here again... wishing you were somehow near...
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed, somehow you would be here...
Wishing I could hear your voice again... knowing that I never would...
Dreaming of you won't help me to do, all that you dreamed I could!
Passing bells and sculpted angels, cold and monumental.
Seem, for you, the wrong companions, you were warm and gentle.
Too many years fighting back tears, why can't the past just die!
Wishing you were somehow here again, knowing we must say goodbye!
Try to forgive, teach me to live!
Give me the strength to try!
No more memories, no more silent tears!
No more gazing across the wasted years!
Help me say goodbye... help me say goodbye!
Wandering child,
So lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father?
Friend or phantom?
Who is it there, staring?
Have you forgotten your Angel?
Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze
Wildly my mind beats against you
You resist
Yet your/the soul obeys...
Angel of Music!
You denied me/I denied you
Turning from true beauty
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protector
Come to me/your strange Angel...
I am your Angel of Music...
Come to me;
Angel of Music No, Christine, wait!
Wait!
Raoul!
Whatever you believe, this man - this thing - is not your father!
No, Raoul, no
Not like this
Now, let it be war upon you both!
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance
To ensnare our clever friend
We're listening...
Go on.
We shall play his game
Perform his work, but remember we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend
We are certain the doors are barred
We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end!
Raoul, I'm frightened...
Don't make me do this
Raoul, it scares me,
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me, I know
We'll be parted forever...
He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream, I now dread.
If he finds me, it won't ever end.
And he'll always be there, singing songs in my head...
He'll always be there, singing songs in my head...
You said yourself,
He was nothing but a man...
Yet while he lives,
He will haunt us 'til we're dead.
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse...
And yet, I wish I could
Oh God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me
In this, the Phantom's opera
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope, and every prayer rests on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin!
"Don Juan"
Here the sire may serve the dam, here the master takes his meat!
Here the sacrificial lamb utters one despairing bleat!
Poor young maiden!
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets you will have to pay the bill - tangled in the winding sheets!
Serve the meal and serve the maid!
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that, when tables, plans and maids are laid,
Don Juan triumphs once again!
Passarino, faithful friend, once again recite the plan.
Your young guest believes I'm you -
I, the master, you, the man
When you met you wore my cloak, she cannot see your face.
She believes she dines with me, in her master's borrowed place!
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff, stealing what, in truth, is mine.
When it's late and modesty starts to mellow, with the wine...
You come home!
I use your voice - slam the door like crack of doom!
I shall say: "come - hide with me!
Where, oh, where?
Of course - my room!"
Poor thing hasn't got a chance!
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword.
Conquest is assured, if I do not forget myself and laugh...
No thoughts within her head, but thoughts of joy!
No dreams within her heart but dreams of love!
Master?
Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for its prey...
You have come here in pursuit of your deepest urge, in pursuit of that wish, which till now has been silent, silent...
I have brought you, that our passions may fuse and merge - in your mind you've already succumbed to me dropped all defences completely succumbed to me - now you are here with me:
no second thoughts, you've decided,
decided...
Past the point of no return - no backward glances:
Our games of make-believe are at an end
Past all thought of "if" or "when" - no use resisting:
abandon thought, and let the dream descend...
What raging fire shall flood the soul
What rich desire unlocks its door
What sweet seduction lies before us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets
Will we learn beyond the point of no return?
You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech disappears
Into silence
Silence.
I have come here,
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent,
Now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided.
Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion-play has now at last begun.
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race
The sleeping bud burst into bloom
When will the flames at last consume us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return.
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you'll want me
With you here
Beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go too
Christine that's all I ask of...
Go!
Oh,?
You left before me
Oh my God
We'll run, Andre, run
Where did he take her?
Come with me, monsieur
I will take you to him
But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I'll go with you
No, Meg, you must stay here
Come with me, monsieur
No!
Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness, deep as hell
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin but the wickedness of my abhorrent face
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Hounded out by everyone
Met with hatred everywhere
No kind words from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine
Why, why...?
Your hand at the level of your eyes
This is as far as I dare go
Thank you
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
That fate, which condemns me to wallow in blood
Has also denied me the joys of the flesh...
This face, the infection which poisons our love...
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing
A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late
Turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this before your eyes
This haunted face holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies
Wait!
I think, my dear, we have a guest
Sir!
- Raoul!
This is indeed an unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped that you would come
And now my wish comes true
You have truly made my night!
Let me go!
Free her
Do what you like, only free her
Have you no pity?
Your lover makes a passionate plea
Please, Raoul, it's useless
I love her
Does that mean nothing?
I love her
Show some compassion
The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine...
Let me see her
Be my guest, sir...
Monsieur, I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay for the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes
Nothing can save you now, except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love!
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice,
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate,
Grow cold and turn to tears of hate
Christine, forgive me, please forgive me
I did it all for you, and all for nothing...
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered Too late for turning back, Too late for prayers and useless pity
Say you love him, and my life is over!
All hope of cries for help, No point in fighting
For either way you choose, You cannot win Either way you choose, he has to win
So do you end your days with me
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
Angel of Music...
Past the point of no return...
Christine say no!
Who deserved this?
Don't throw your life away for my sake!
The final threshold...
His life is now the prize which you must earn!
Why do you curse mercy?
I fought so hard to free you...
Angel of Music... you deceived me You've passed the point of no return!
I gave you my mind blindly
You try my patience,
Make your choice!
Pitiful creature of darkness,
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you,
You are not alone...
Track down this murderer, he must be found!
Take her, forget me,
Forget all of this...
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground!
Leave me alone - forget all you've seen...
Go now - don't let them find you!
Take the boat, swear to me, never to tell
The secret you know, of the angel in hell!
Go now - go now and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you...
Christine, I love you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You alone, can make my song take flight
It's over now, the music of the night
"Countess de Chagny Beloved wife and mother"
"Chrisine 1854-1917"
Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness
Who will be there for you
Comfort and care for you
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion
Never dreamed out in the world
There are arms to hold you?
You've always known
Your heart was on its own
So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone
Learn to be lonely
Life can be lived
Life can be loved
Alone.

A collector's piece indeed
Every detail
Exactly as she said
Will you still play When all the rest of us are dead?
Lot 666, then.
A chandelier in pieces.
Some of you may recall the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera.
A mystery never fully explained.
We're told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the very chandelier ... which figures in the famous disaster.
Our workshops have repaired it and wired parts of it for the new electric light.
Perhaps we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago ... with a little illumination.
Gentlemen?
The trophy From our saviors
From our saviors
From the enslaving force
Of Rome!
Madame.
With feasting and dancing and song
Tonight in celebration We greet the victorious throng
Returned to bring salvation!
I've got them, monsieur.
Vicomte, welcome.
The trumpets of Carthage resound
Hear, Romans, now and tremble
Hark to our step on the ground
Hear the drums Hannibal comes!
You make my dress train too long.
Sad to return To find the land we love
Threatened once more By Roma's far-reaching grasp
Gentlemen, gentlemen --
Rehearsals are under way for a new production of Chalumeau's Hannibal.
- Monsieur Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
- Monsieur Reyer, Madame Giry ... ladies and gentlemen, please, if I could have your attention?
As you know, there have been rumors of my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you that these were all true, and it is my pleasure to introduce you ... to the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire ...
Monsieur Richard Firmin and Monsieur Gilles Andre.
I'm sure you have read of their recent fortune in the junk business.
Scrap metal, actually.
They must be rich.
And we are deeply honored to introduce our new patron.
The Vicomte de Chagny.
I still can't believe we managed to get him.
It's such a coup for us, my dear.
It's Raoul.
Before my father died, at the house by the sea ...
I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts.
- He called me Little Lotte.
- Christine, he's so handsome.
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts ... especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire.
Gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli, our leading soprano for five seasons.
- Brava!
Brava!
- Brava!
Brava!
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honor, signor.
I believe I'm keeping you from your rehearsal.
I will be here this evening to share your great triumph.
My apologies.
Thank you, monsieur.
- Once more if you please, signor.
- He love me.
He love me.
Thank you, indeed, for the wonderful words.
So inspiring and encouraging ...
He wouldn't recognize me.
- He didn't see you.
- If you please.
Monsieur.
We take particular pride in the excellence of our ballet.
I see why.
Especially that little blond angel.
My daughter, Meg Giry.
And that exceptional beauty.
No relation, I trust?
Christine Daae.
Promising talent, Monsieur Firmin.
Very promising.
Daae, did you say?
No relation to the famous Swedish violinist?
His only child.
Orphaned at 7 when she came to live and train in the ballet dormitories.
An orphan, you say?
I think of her as a daughter also.
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side.
Hannibal's friends!
Ah, me!
Not on my dress!
Why?
The trumpeting elephants sound
Hear, Romans, now and tremble
Hark to their step on the ground
Hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
All day!
All they want is the dancing!
Well, the Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala.
I hope he is as excited by dancing girls as your new managers ... because I will not be singing!
Get my doggy, bring my doggy.
Bye-bye.
- What do we do?
- Grovel.
- Grovel, grovel.
- Right.
- I'm going now.
It is finished.
- World-renowned artist and great beauty.
Bella diva.
Goddess of song.
Monsieur Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elissa ... in Act 3 of Hannibal?
Perhaps the signora --
Because I have not my costume for Act 3.
Because somebody not finish it!
And I hate my hat!
Signora, as a personal favor, would you oblige us with a private rendition?
Unless, of course, Monsieur Reyer objects.
If my managers command.
- Monsieur Reyer?
- If my diva commands.
Yes, I do.
Everybody, very quiet.
- Monsieur, why exactly are you retiring?
- My health.
- I see.
- You as well!
Signora.
Maestro.
Think of me Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again You long to take your heart back
And be free --
- Oh, my God, signora!
- I hate you.
- Lift it up!
- He's here.
The Phantom of the Opera.
Signora, are you all right?
Buquet!
For God's sake, what's going on up there?
Please, monsieur, don't look at me.
As God's my judge, I wasn't at my post.
Please, monsieur, there's no one there.
Or if there is, well, then, it must be a ghost.
Signora, these things do happen.
For the past three years these things do happen.
And did you stop them from happening?
No!
And you two, you are as bad as him.
"These things do happen."
Until you stop these things from happening, this thing does not happen!
- Bring my doggy and my boxy.
- Amateurs.
Now you see.
Bye-bye, I'm really leaving.
Gentlemen, good luck.
If you need me, I shall be in Australia.
Signora Giudicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?
You think so, monsieur?
- I have a message from the Opera Ghost.
- Oh, God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
- He welcomes you to his opera house.
- His opera house?
And commands that you continue to leave box five empty ... for his use.
And reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Well, Monsieur Lefevre used to give him 20,000 francs a month.
Twenty thousand francs?
Perhaps you can afford more.
With the vicomte as your patron?
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight ... when the vicomte was to join us for the gala.
Obviously, we shall now have to cancel, as it appears we have lost our star!
- But surely there must be an understudy.
- There is no understudy for La Carlotta!
A full house, Andre.
We shall have to refund a full house!
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.
What, a chorus girl?
Don't be silly.
She has been taking lessons from a great teacher.
- Who?
- I don't know his name, monsieur.
Let her sing for you, monsieur.
She has been well taught.
All right.
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on, come along.
Just ...
From the beginning of the aria then, please, mademoiselle.
- Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
- She's very pretty.
Think of me Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me
We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me
Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way
Things might have been
Think of me, think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard
To put you from my mind
Recall those days, look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me
But I remember her
Flowers fade, the fruits of summer fade
They have their seasons so do we
But please promise me, that sometimes
You will think
of me
Brava!
Brava, brava, bravissima
Christine, Christine
Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding?
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor?
Meg ... when your mother brought me here to live ... whenever I'd come down here alone ... to light a candle for my father ... a voice, from above ... and in my dreams, he was always there.
You see ... when my father lay dying ... he told me I would be protected by an angel.
An Angel of Music.
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father's coaching you?
Who else, Meg?
Who?
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room, he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you
Angel of Music ... guide and guardian
- Grant to me your glory
- Who is this angel?
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer
- Secret and strange angel
- Secret and strange angel
He's with me even now
- Your hands are cold
- All around me
Your face, Christine, it's white
- It frightens me
- Don't be frightened
No.
You did very well, my dear.
He is pleased with you.
- Vicomte.
- Vicomte.
We've made quite a discovery with Miss Daae.
Perhaps we could present her to you, dear vicomte?
If you wouldn't mind, this is one visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you.
It would appear they've met before.
Little Lotte let her mind wander.
Little Lotte thought, "Am I fonder of dolls or of goblins or shoes?"
- Raoul.
- "or of riddles or frocks?"
- Those picnics in the attic.
- "or of chocolates?"
- Father playing the violin.
- As we read to each other ... dark stories of the North.
- No.
"What I love best," Lotte said, "is when I'm asleep in my bed."
And the Angel of Music sings songs in my head
The Angel of Music sings songs in my head
You sang like an angel tonight.
Father said:
"When I'm in heaven, child, I will send the Angel of Music to you."
Well, father is dead, Raoul.
And I have been visited by the Angel of Music.
No doubt of it.
And now we go to supper.
No, Raoul.
- The Angel of Music is very strict.
- Well, I shan't keep you up late.
Raoul, no.
You must change.
I'll order my carriage, Little Lotte.
No.
Raoul, wait!
Insolent boy, this slave of fashion
Basking in your glory
Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor
Sharing in my triumph
Angel, I hear you Speak, I listen
Stay by my side, guide me
Angel, my soul was weak, forgive me
Enter at last, master
Flattering child, you shall know me
See why in shadow I hide
Look at your face in the mirror
I am there inside!
Angel of Music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory
Angel of Music, hide no longer
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
- I am your Angel of Music
- Christine.
Christine!
Come to me, Angel of Music
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
- Your spirit and my voice
- My spirit and your voice
- In one combined
- In one combined
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, my Angel of Music.
Sing, my angel.
Sing for me!
Sing, my angel.
Sing for me!
I have brought you
To the seat of sweet music's throne
To this kingdom where all must Pay homage to music
Music, you have come here
For one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing
I have needed you with me To serve me, to sing
For my music
My music
Night-time sharpens
Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs
And wakes imagination
Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses
Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away
From cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before.
Close your eyes
Let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before
Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know
You cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night
Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you
Where you long to be
Only then can you belong
To me
Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make
The music of the
Night
Christine?
Like yellow parchment is his skin
A great black hole serves as the nose that never grew
You must be always on your guard
Or he will catch you with his magical lasso
Oh, my.
Those who speak of what they know
Find too late that prudent silence is wise
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes.
I remember there was mist
Swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around
And on the lake there was a boat
And in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows?
Whose is the face in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora
You little demon!
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah.
You little viper.
Now you cannot ever be free.
Damn you!
Curse you!
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look or bear to think of me?
This loathsome gargoyle who burns in hell
But secretly yearns for heaven secretly, secretly
Christine.
Fear can turn to love you'll learn to see, to find the man behind the monster, this repulsive carcass who seems a beast
But secretly dreams of beauty secretly, secretly.
Oh, Christine
Come, we must return.
Those two fools who run my theater will be missing you.
"Mystery after gala night"
It says "Mystery of soprano's flight"
"Mystified" All the papers say
"We are mystified, we suspect foul play"
Bad news on soprano scene.
First Carlotta, now Christine
Still at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold
What a way to run a business
Spare me these unending trials
Half your cast disappears, but the crowd still cheers
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel, have a scandal
- And you're sure to have a hit
- Damnable, will they all walk out?
- This is damnable
- Andre, please don't shout
It's publicity, and the take is vast, free publicity
But we have no cast
Andre, have you seen the queue?
Ah, it seems you've got one too
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala Christine was, in a word, sublime
We were hardly bereft, when Carlotta left
On that note, the diva's a disaster
Must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?"
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder
My salary has not been paid
Send it care of the Ghost By return of post, PTO
No one likes a debtor so it's better if my orders are obeyed"
Who would have the gall to send this?
- Someone with a puerile brain
- These are both signed O.G.
- Who the hell is he?
- Opera Ghost
- It's nothing short of shocking
- He is mocking our position
- In addition he wants money
- What a funny apparition
To expect a large retainer, he is clearly quite insane
- Where is she?
- Carlotta?
I mean, Miss Daae, where is she?
- How do we know?
- I want an answer
- You sent me this note
- What's this nonsense?
- Of course not
- Don't look at us
- She's not with you?
- Of course not
- We're in the dark
- Don't argue, isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it that we're meant to have wrote?
Written.
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again."
- If you didn't write it, who did?
- Where is he?
- Welcome back
- Your precious patron, where is he?
- What is it?
- I have your letter
- A letter I rather resent
- Did you send it?
- Of course not
- As if he would
- You didn't send it?
- Of course not
- What's going on?
- Tell me, this is not the letter you sent?
And what is it That I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune should you attempt to take her place."
Far too many notes for my taste
And most of them about Christine
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name
- Miss Daae has returned
- I hope no worse for wear
- As far as we're concerned
- Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best she was alone
She needed rest
- May I see her?
- No, monsieur, she will see no one
Will she sing?
Will she sing?
- Here, I have a note
- Let me see it
Please.
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature detailing how my theater is to be run.
You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance.
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the pageboy
And put Miss Daae in the role of countess
The role which Miss Daae plays
Calls for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent
Which makes my casting in a word, ideal
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five which will be kept empty for me.
Should these commands be ignored a disaster beyond your imagination will occur.
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant.
O.G."
- Christine
- Whatever next?
- It's all a ploy to help Christine
- This is insane
I know who sent this.
The Vicomte, her lover
- Indeed!
Can you believe this?
- Signora
- Signora
- You are our star
- And always will be
- Signora
- The man is mad
- We don't take orders
Miss Daae will be playing the pageboy, the silent role.
Carlotta will be playing the lead
- It's useless trying to appease me
- Appease her
- You're only saying this to please me
- To please her
- Who scorn his word, beware to those
- You have reviled me
- The angel sees, the angel knows
- You have rebuked me
- Signora, pardon us
- You have replaced me
Please, signora, we beseech you
- I must see her
- This hour shall see your darkest fears
- The angel knows, the angel hears
- Where did she go?
Signora, sing for us.
Don't be a martyr
- What new surprises lie in store?
- Our star!
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?
Miss Daae?
Your public needs you.
We need you too.
Would you not rather have your precious little ingénue?
- Signora, no.
- Signora, no.
The world wants you
Prima donna, first lady of the stage
Your devotees are on their knees
To implore you
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you
Prima donna, enchant us once again
- Think of your muse
- And of the queues round the theater
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna, once more
- Christine spoke of an angel
- Prima donna
Your song shall live again
- Think of your public
- You took a snub
- But there's a public who needs you
- She has heard the voice
- Of the Angel of Music
- Those who hear your voice
- Liken you to an angel
- Think of their cry of undying support
- We get our opera
- She gets her limelight
- Follow where the limelight leads you
- Leading ladies are a trial
Prima donna, your song shall never die
- You'll sing again and to unending ovation
- Orders, warnings
- Lunatic demands
- Lunatic demands are regular occurrences
Think how you'll shine in that final encore
Surely there'll be further scenes worse than this?
I must see these demands are rejected
Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve a chorus girl
Who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette entwined in love's duet
Although he may demur, he must have been with her
You'd never get away, with all this in a play
But if it's loudly sung, and in a foreign tongue
It's just the sort of story audiences adore
- In fact, a perfect opera
- For if his curse is on the opera
Prima donna, the world is at your feet
A nation waits and how it hates to be cheated
Light up the stage
With that age-old rapport
Sing, prima donna
Once more
Go on, go, go.
They say that this youth has set my lady's heart aflame
His Lordship, sure would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughing stock
Should he suspect her, God protect her Shame, shame, shame
This faithless lady's Bound for Hades
Shame, shame, shame
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect
Why, who can this be?
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband
That's exactly the sort of thing the public loves.
My love, I'm called to England on affairs of state
And must leave you with your new maid
Though I would happily take the maid with me.
The old fool is leaving.
It's the Countess de Charbourg.
She's invited us to her salon, you know.
Nothing like that ever happened in the junk business.
Scrap metal.
Serafimo, away with this pretense
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
Time I tried to get a better, better half
Poor fool, he doesn't know
If he knew the truth he'd never ever go
Did I not instruct that box five was to be kept empty?
He's here, the Phantom of the Opera.
- It's him.
- Your part is silent, little toad.
A toad, Madame?
Perhaps it is you who are the toad.
Why you spray on my chin all the time, huh?
Serafimo, away with this pretense
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my --
Gentlemen, please, please.
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
She's lost her voice.
Mother!
Bring the curtain in, please, will you?
Get off.
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize.
The performance will continue in 10 minutes' time when the role of the countess will be played by Miss Daae.
Thank you.
Go, go, hurry up.
Hurry up.
Until then, we would crave your indulgence for a few moments.
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act 3 of tonight's opera.
- What?
- Maestro ... the ballet, bring it forward, please.
- The ballet.
- The ballet, now, please.
Thank you.
You're fired.
- Are you all right?
- Raoul, we're not safe here.
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It's simply an accident.
An accident.
Why have you brought me here?
- We can't go back there
- We must return
He'll kill you.
His eyes will find us there.
- Christine, don't say that
- Those eyes that burn
- Don't even think it
- If he has to kill a thousand men
- Forget this waking nightmare
- The Phantom of the Opera will kill
Believe me, there is no Phantom of the Opera
My God, who is this man who hunts to kill?
- This mask of death
- I can't escape from him
- Whose is this voice you hear
- I never will
- With every breath?
- And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
- The Phantom of the Opera is here
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind
There is no Phantom of the Opera
Raoul, I've been there
To his world of unending night
To a world where the daylight dissolves into darkness
Darkness
Raoul, I've seen him
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed.
It was hardly a face
In that darkness
Darkness.
But his voice filled my spirit With a strange, sweet sound
In that night, there was music in my mind
And through music my soul began
To soar
And I heard
- As I'd never heard before
- What you heard was a dream
And nothing more
Yet in his eyes
All the sadness of the world
Those pleading eyes
That both threaten
And adore
Christine
Christine ...
No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you
Say you love me
Every waking moment
Turn my head
With talk of summertime
Say you need me with you
Now and always
Promise me
That all you say is true
- That's all I ask of you
- Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe, no one will find you
Your fears are far behind you
All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you always beside me
To hold me and to hide me
Then say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Let me lead you
From your solitude
Say you need me with you
Here beside you
Anywhere you go let me go too
Christine
That's all I ask of you
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
- Say you love me
- You know I do
Love me
That's all I ask of you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
Love me
That's all I ask of you
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Come with me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses
Be with them at the door
And soon you'll be beside me
You'll guard me and you'll guide me
I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you
When he heard you sing
Christine.
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
You will curse the day
You did not do
All that the Phantom
Asked of you
Monsieur Andre.
Monsieur Firmin.
Dear Andre, what a splendid party
The prologue to a bright new year
- Quite a night, I'm impressed
- Well, one does one's best
- Here's to us
- The toast of all the city
What a pity that the Phantom can't be here
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade
Masquerade
Look around, there's another mask behind you
Flash of mauve, splash of puce, fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest, trace of rouge, face of beast
- Faces!
Take your turn
- Take a ride
- On the merry-go-round
- In an inhuman race
Eye of gold, thigh of blue, true is false, who is who?
Curl of lip, swirl of gown, ace of hearts, face of clown
Faces!
Drink it in, drink it up
Till you've drowned in the light, in the sound
But who can name the face?
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds.
Masquerade
Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you
Masquerade
Seething shadows, breathing lies
Masquerade
You can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade
Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you
- What a night
- What a crowd
- Makes you glad
- Makes you proud
- All the crème de la crème
- Watching us watching them
- Three months of relief - of delight
- of Elysian peace
- And we can breathe at last
- No more notes
- No more ghost
- Here's to health
- Here's a toast to a prosperous year
- To our friends who are here
- And may our splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade
Think of it
A secret engagement.
Look, your future bride.
- Just think of it.
- But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me.
- No Raoul please don't, they'll see.
- Let them see.
It's an engagement, not a crime.
Christine, what are you afraid of?
- Let's not argue
- Let's not argue
- Please pretend
- I can only hope
- You will understand in time
- I'll understand in time
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade.
Masquerade
Look around, there's another mask behind you
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads.
Masquerade

Masquerade!

Masquerade
Take your fill let the spectacle astound you
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera
Here, I bring the finished score
Don Juan Triumphant
Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting round the stage
Our Don Juan must lose some weight
It's not healthy
In a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn
That their place is in an office not the arts.
As for our star
Miss Christine Daae
No doubt she'll do her best.
It's true her voice is good
She knows, though should she wish to excel
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me her teacher
Your chains are still mine!
You belong to me!
- Madame Giry
- Please Monsieur, I know no more than anyone else.
- That's not true!
- Monsieur, don't ask.
- There have been too many accidents.
- Accidents?
Please, Madame Giry for all our sakes.
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a traveling fair in the city.
Gypsies.
I was very young.
Studying to be a ballerina.
One of many.
Living in the dormitories of the opera house.
See the wonder from the East!
Come.
Come inside.
Come and see the Devil's Child.
Behold, mesdames and messieurs, the Devil's Child!
Devil's Child.
Murder!
- Murder!
- Which way?
!
That way!
That way!
He's getting away!
I hid him from the world and its cruelties.
He has known nothing else of life since then ... except this opera house.
It was his playground ... and now his artistic domain.
He's a genius.
He's an architect and designer.
He's a composer and a magician.
- A genius, monsieur.
- But clearly, Madame Giry ... genius has turned to madness.
- Monsieur.
- Where to?
The cemetery.
To my father's grave, please.
- Where have they gone?
- The cemetery.
In sleep, he sang to me ln dreams, he came
That voice, which calls to me
And speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing.
Her father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.
Her father promised her.
You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered
Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here
Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could
Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle
Too many years fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die?
Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive, teach me to live
Give me the strength to try
No more memories, no more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye
Help me say
Goodbye
Wandering child, so lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father, friend or phantom?
- Who is it there staring?
- Have you forgotten your angel?
Angel oh speak, what endless longings?
Echo in this whisper?
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze
- Wildly, my mind beats against you
- You resist
- Yet your soul obeys
- Yet the soul obeys
- Angel of Music, you denied me
- Angel of Music, I denied you
- Turning from true beauty
- Turning from true beauty
- Angel of Music, do not shun me
- Angel of Music, my protector
- Come to your strange angel
- Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel
- Of Music
- No, Christine!
Wait!
Wait!
- Raoul!
- Whatever you believe, this man, this thing is not your father!
No, Raoul!
No.
Not like this.
Now let it be war upon you both.
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance to ensnare our clever friend
- We're listening
- Go on
We shall play his game
Perform his work.
But remember, we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings, he is certain to attend
- We are certain the doors are barred
- We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end
Raoul, I'm frightened.
Don't make me do this.
Raoul.
It scares me.
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me.
I know.
We'll be parted forever.
He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream
I now dread.
If he finds me, it won't ever end.
And he'll always be there
Singing songs in my head
He'll always be there
Singing songs in my head
You said yourself
He was nothing but a man
Yet while he lives
He will haunt us
Till we're dead
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse
And yet, I wish I could
Oh, God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me
In this, the Phantom's opera?
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope and every prayer
Rests on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin
Here the sire may serve the dam
Here the master takes his meat
Here the sacrificial lamb
Utters one despairing bleat
Poor young maiden
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets
You will have to pay the bill
Tangled in the winding sheets
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that when tables, plans and maids are laid
Don Juan triumphs
Once again.
Passarino, faithful friend
Once again recite the plan
Your young guest believes I'm you
I, the master.
You, the man
When you met you wore my cloak.
She could not have seen your face
She believes she dines with me in her master's borrowed place
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff stealing what, in truth, is mine
When it's late and modesty starts to mellow with the wine
You come home, I use your voice.
Slam the door like crack of doom
I shall say, "Come hide with me.
Where, oh where?
Of course, my room!"
- Poor thing hasn't got a chance
- Here's my hat, my cloak and sword
Conquest is assured If I do not forget myself and laugh
No thoughts within her head but thoughts of joy
No dreams within her heart
But dreams of love
Master?
Passarino
Go away, for the trap is set
And waits for its prey
You have come here
In pursuit of your deepest urge
In pursuit of that wish which till now
Has been silent
Silent
I have brought you
That our passions may fuse and merge
In your mind you've already succumbed to me
Dropped all defenses, completely succumbed to me
Now you are here with me
No second thoughts
You've decided
Decided
Past the point of no return
No backward glances
Our games of make-believe
Are at an end
Past all thought of "if" or "when"
No use resisting
Abandon thought
And let the dream descend
What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction lies before us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm, unspoken secrets
Will we learn?
Beyond the point of no return
You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech disappears into silence
Silence
I have come here
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining Defenseless and silent
Now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided
Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion play Has now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait
Before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race?
The sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flames at last
Consume us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no
Return
Say you'll share with me
One love
One lifetime
Lead me, save me
From my solitude
Say you want me with you
Here beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go too
Christine
That's all I ask of --
Go!
Piangi, my love!
Oh, my God!
We're ruined, Andre.
Ruined!
Where did he take her?
Come with me.
I will take you to him.
But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes!
- I'll come with you!
- No, Meg, no.
You must stay here.
Come with me.
Do as I say.
No!
Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness
Deep as hell
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin but the wickedness of my abhorrent face!
Track down this murderer!
He must be found!
Hounded out by everyone
Met with hatred everywhere
No kind words from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine
Why?
- Your hand at the level of your eyes
- At the level of your eyes
At the level of your eyes
This is as far as I dare go.
Thank you.
Have you gorged yourself at last
In your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey
To your lust for flesh?
That fate which condemns me to wallow in blood
Has also denied me the joys of the flesh
This face, the infection
Which poisons our love
This face which earned
A mother's fear and loathing
A mask
My first unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late
Turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this
Before your eyes
This haunted face
Holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul
That the true distortion lies
Wait!
I think, my dear, we have a guest
- Sir
- Raoul!
This is indeed an unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped
That you would come
And now, my wish comes true
- You have truly made my night
- Let me go.
Free her!
Do what you like only free her!
- Have you no pity?
- Your lover makes a passionate plea
- Please, Raoul, it's useless
- I love her
Does that mean nothing?
I love her!
- Show some compassion
- The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine, Christine.
Let me see her
Be my guest, sir
Monsieur, I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay
For the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now!
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes!
Nothing can save you now
Except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice!
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed
For your dark fate
Grow cold and turn
To tears of hate
Christine, forgive me.
Please, forgive me.
- I did it all for you and all for nothing
- Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend
- We had such hopes
- Too late for turning back
- Now those hopes are shattered
- Too late for prayers and pity
- Say you love him
- All hope of cries for help
- And my life is over
- No point in fighting
- For either way you choose you cannot win
- But either way you choose he has to win
So do you end your days with me?
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
- Angel of Music
- Past the point of no return
- Christine, say no!
- Who deserves this?
- Don't throw your life away for my sake
- His life is now the prize
- Which you must earn
- I fought so hard to free you
- You've passed the point of no return
- Angel of Music
You deceived me
I gave you my mind blindly.
You try my patience.
Make your choice.
Pitiful creature of darkness
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you
You are not alone
Track down this murderer
Take her!
Forget me.
Forget all of this
Leave me alone
Forget all you've seen
Go now.
Don't let them find you
Take the boat.
Swear to me never to tell
The secrets you know of the Angel in Hell
The Phantom of the Opera is there.
Deep down below
Go now
Go now and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you
Christine, I love you
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word
And I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
You alone can make my song
Take flight
It's over now
The music
Of the night
Sold.
Your number, sir?
Thank you.
Lot 663, then, ladies and gentlemen.
A poster from this house's production of Hannibal by Chalumeau.
- Showing here.
- Do I have 10 francs?
Five, then.
Five I am bid.
Six.
Seven.
Against you, sir, seven.
Eight?
Eight once.
Selling twice.
Sold, to Monsieur Deferre.
Thank you very much, sir.
Lot 664, a wooden pistol and three human skulls from the 1831 production of Robert le Diable by Meyerbeer.
Ten francs for this.
Ten, thank you.
Ten still.
Fifteen, thank you.
Fifteen I'm bid.
Going at 15.
Your number, sir?
Lot 665, ladies and gentlemen a papier-mache musical box in the shape of a barrel organ.
Attached, the figure of a monkey in Persian robes playing the cymbals.
This item discovered in the vaults of the theater, still in working order.
Showing here.
May I commence at 15 francs?
Fifteen, thank you.
Yes, 20 from you, sir.
Thank you very much.
Madame Giry, 25.
Thank you, madame.
Twenty-five I'm bid.
Do I hear 30?
Thirty.
And 35?
Selling at 30 francs, then.
Thirty once, 30 twice...
Sold for 30 francs to the Vicomte de Chagny.
Thank you, sir.
A collector's piece indeed
Every detail
Exactly as she said
Will you still play When all the rest of us are dead?
Lot 666, then.
A chandelier in pieces.
Some of you may recall the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera.
A mystery never fully explained.
We're told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the very chandelier which figures in the famous disaster.
Our workshops have repaired it and wired parts of it for the new electric light.
Perhaps we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago with a little illumination.
Gentlemen?
The trophy From our saviors
From our saviors
From the enslaving force of Rome!
Madame.
With feasting and dancing and song
Tonight in celebration we greet the victorious throng
Returned to bring salvation!
I've got them, monsieur.
Vicomte, welcome.
The trumpets of Carthage resound
Hear, Romans, now and tremble
Hark to our step on the ground
Hear the drums Hannibal comes!
You make my dress train too long.
Sad to return to find the land we love
Threatened once more by Roma's far-reaching grasp
Gentlemen, gentlemen...
Rehearsals are under way for a new production of Chalumeau's Hannibal.
- Monsieur Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
- Monsieur Reyer, Madame Giry ladies and gentlemen, please, if I could have your attention?
As you know, there have been rumors of my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you that these were all true, and it is my pleasure to introduce you to the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire Monsieur Richard Firmin and Monsieur Gilles Andre.
I'm sure you have read of their recent fortune in the junk business.
Scrap metal, actually.
They must be rich.
And we are deeply honored to introduce our new patron.
The Vicomte de Chagny.
I still can't believe we managed to get him.
It's such a coup for us, my dear.
It's Raoul.
Before my father died, at the house by the sea I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts.
- He called me Little Lotte.
- Christine, he's so handsome.
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire.
Gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli, our leading soprano for five seasons.
- Brava!
Brava!
- Brava!
Brava!
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honor, signor.
I believe I'm keeping you from your rehearsal.
I will be here this evening to share your great triumph.
My apologies.
Thank you, monsieur.
- Once more if you please, signor.
- He love me.
He love me.
Thank you, indeed, for the wonderful words.
So inspiring and encouraging...
He wouldn't recognize me.
- He didn't see you.
- If you please.
Monsieur.
We take particular pride in the excellence of our ballet.
I see why.
Especially that little blond angel.
My daughter, Meg Giry.
And that exceptional beauty.
No relation, I trust?
Christine Daae.
Promising talent, Monsieur Firmin.
Very promising.
Daae, did you say?
No relation to the famous Swedish violinist?
His only child.
Orphaned at 7 when she came to live and train in the ballet dormitories.
An orphan, you say?
I think of her as a daughter also.
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side.
Hannibal's friends!
Ah, me!
Not on my dress!
Why?
The trumpeting elephants sound
Hear, Romans, now and tremble
Hark to their step on the ground
Hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
All day!
All they want is the dancing!
Well, the Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala.
I hope he is as excited by dancing girls as your new managers because I will not be singing!
Get my doggy, bring my doggy.
Bye-bye.
- What do we do?
- Grovel.
- Grovel, grovel.
- Right.
- I'm going now.
It is finished.
- World-renowned artist and great beauty.
Bella diva.
Goddess of song.
Monsieur Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elissa in Act 3 of Hannibal?
Perhaps the signora...
Because I have not my costume for Act 3.
Because somebody not finish it!
And I hate my hat!
Signora, as a personal favor, would you oblige us with a private rendition?
Unless, of course, Monsieur Reyer objects.
If my managers command.
- Monsieur Reyer?
- If my diva commands.
Yes, I do.
Everybody, very quiet.
- Monsieur, why exactly are you retiring?
- My health.
- I see.
- You as well!
Signora.
Maestro.
Think of me Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again you long to take your heart back
And be free...
- Oh, my God, signora!
- I hate you.
- Lift it up!
- He's here.
The Phantom of the Opera.
Signora, are you all right?
Buquet!
For God's sake, what's going on up there?
Please, monsieur, don't look at me.
As God's my judge, I wasn't at my post.
Please, monsieur, there's no one there.
Or if there is, well, then, it must be a ghost.
Signora, these things do happen.
For the past three years these things do happen.
And did you stop them from happening?
No!
And you two, you are as bad as him.
"These things do happen."
Until you stop these things from happening, this thing does not happen!
- Bring my doggy and my boxy.
- Amateurs.
Now you see.
Bye-bye, I'm really leaving.
Gentlemen, good luck.
If you need me, I shall be in Australia.
Signora Giudicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?
You think so, monsieur?
- I have a message from the Opera Ghost.
- Oh, God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
- He welcomes you to his opera house.
- His opera house?
And commands that you continue to leave box five empty for his use.
And reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Well, Monsieur Lefevre used to give him 20,000 francs a month.
Twenty thousand francs?
Perhaps you can afford more.
With the vicomte as your patron?
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight when the vicomte was to join us for the gala.
Obviously, we shall now have to cancel, as it appears we have lost our star!
- But surely there must be an understudy.
- There is no understudy for La Carlotta!
A full house, Andre.
We shall have to refund a full house!
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.
What, a chorus girl?
Don't be silly.
She has been taking lessons from a great teacher.
- Who?
- I don't know his name, monsieur.
Let her sing for you, monsieur.
She has been well taught.
All right.
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on, come along.
Just...
From the beginning of the aria then, please, mademoiselle.
- Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
- She's very pretty.
Think of me Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again you long to take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me
We never said our love was evergreen or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me
Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way
Things might have been
Think of me, think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard to put you from my mind
Recall those days Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago it seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me
But I remember her
Flowers fade The fruits of summer fade
They have their seasons So do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me
Brava!
Brava!
Brava, brava, bravissima
Christine, Christine
Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding?
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor?
Meg when your mother brought me here to live whenever I'd come down here alone to light a candle for my father a voice, from above and in my dreams, he was always there.
You see when my father lay dying he told me I would be protected by an angel.
An angel of music.
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father's coaching you?
Who else, Meg?
Who?
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius
Christine, you must have been dreaming stories like this can't come true
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you
Angel of Music Guide and guardian
- Grant to me your glory
- Who is this angel?
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer
- Secret and strange angel
- Secret and strange angel
He's with me even now
- Your hands are cold
- All around me
Your face, Christine, it's white
- It frightens me
- Don't be frightened
No.
No.
You did very well, my dear.
He is pleased with you.
- Vicomte.
- Vicomte.
We've made quiet a discovery with Miss Daae.
Perhaps we could present her to you, dear vicomte?
If you wouldn't mind, this is one visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you.
It would appear they've met before.
Little Lotte let her mind wander.
Little Lotte thought, "Am I fonder of dolls or of goblins or shoes?"
- Raoul.
- "Or of riddles or frocks?"
- Those picnics in the attic.
- "Or of chocolates?"
- Father playing the violin.
- As we read to each other dark stories of the North.
- No.
"What I love best," Lotte said, "is when I'm asleep in my bed."
And the Angel of Music sings songs in my head
The Angel of Music sings songs in my head
You sang like an angel tonight.
Father said:
"When I'm in heaven, child, I will send the Angel of Music to you."
Well, father is dead, Raoul.
And I have been visited by the Angel of Music.
No doubt of it.
And now we go to supper.
No, Raoul.
- The Angel of Music is very strict.
- Well, I shan't keep you up late.
Raoul, no.
You must change.
I'll order my carriage, Little Lotte.
No.
Raoul, wait!
Insolent boy, this slave of fashion
Basking in your glory
Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor
Sharing in my triumph
Angel, I hear you Speak, I listen
Stay by my side Guide me
Angel, my soul was weak Forgive me
Enter at last, master
Flattering child, you shall know me
See why in shadow I hide
Look at your face in the mirror
I am there inside!
Angel of Music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory
Angel of Music, hide no longer
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
- I am your Angel of Music
- Christine.
Christine!
Come to me, Angel of Music
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find...
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside your mind
Those who have seen your face draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
- Your spirit and my voice
- My spirit and your voice
- In one combined
- In one combined
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, my Angel of Music.
Sing, my angel.
Sing for me!
Sing, my angel.
Sing for me!
I have brought you
To the seat of sweet music's throne
To this kingdom where all must pay homage to music
Music, you have come here
For one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing
I have needed you with me to serve me, to sing
For my music
My music
Nighttime sharpens heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away
From cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes
Let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before
Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night
Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you
Where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in to the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make...
The music of the night
Christine?
Like yellow parchment is his skin
A great black hole serves as the nose that never grew
You must be always on your guard
Or he will catch you with his magical lasso
Oh, my.
Those who speak of what they know
Find too late that prudent silence is wise
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes.
I remember there was mist
Swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around
And on the lake there was a boat
And in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows?
Whose is the face in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora
You little demon!
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah
You little viper Now you cannot ever be free
Damn you!
Curse you!
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look or bear to think of me?
This loathsome gargoyle who burns in hell
But secretly yearns for heaven secretly, secretly
Christine
Fear can turn to love
You'll learn to see to find the man
Behind the monster, this
Repulsive carcass who seems a beast
But secretly dreams of beauty ... secretly, secretly
Oh, Christine
Come, we must return.
Those two fools who run my theater will be missing you.
"Mystery after gala night"
It says "Mystery of soprano's flight"
"Mystified" All the papers say
"We are mystified We suspect foul play"
Bad news on soprano scene first Carlotta, now Christine still at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold
What a way to run a business
Spare me these unending trials
Half your cast disappears but the crowd still cheers
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel Have a scandal
- And you're sure to have a hit
- Damnable, will they all walk out?
- This is damnable
- Andre, please don't shout
It's publicity, and the take is vast free publicity
But we have no cast
Andre, have you seen the queue?
It seems you've got one too
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala Christine was, in a word, sublime
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left
On that note, the diva's a disaster
Must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?"
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder
My salary has not been paid
Send it care of the Ghost by return of post PTO
No one likes a debtor so it's better if my orders are obeyed"
Who would have the gall to send this?
- Someone with a puerile brain
- These are both signed O.G.
- Who the hell is he?
- Opera Ghost
- It's nothing short of shocking
- He is mocking our position
- In addition he wants money
- What a funny apparition
To expect a large retainer he is clearly quite insane
- Where is she?
- Carlotta?
I mean, Miss Daae Where is she?
- How do we know?
- I want an answer
- You sent me this note
- What's this nonsense?
- Of course not
- Don't look at us
- She's not with you?
- Of course not
- We're in the dark
- Don't argue, isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it that we're meant to have wrote?
Written.
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again."
- If you didn't write it, who did?
- Where is he?
- Welcome back
- Your precious patron, where is he?
- What is it?
- I have your letter
- A letter I rather resent
- Did you send it?
- Of course not
- As if he would
- You didn't send it?
- Of course not
- What's going on?
- Tell me, this is not the letter you sent?
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune should you attempt to take her place."
Far too many notes for my taste
And most of them about Christine
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name
- Miss Daae has returned
- I hope no worse for wear
- As far as we're concerned
- Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best she was alone
She needed rest
- May I see her?
- No, monsieur, she will see no one
Will she sing?
Will she sing?
- Here, I have a note
- Let me see it
Please.
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature detailing how my theater is to be run.
You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance.
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress in the new production of II Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the pageboy
And put Miss Daae in the role of countess
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent which makes my casting in a word, ideal
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five which will be kept empty for me.
Should these commands be ignored a disaster beyond your imagination will occur.
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant.
O.G."
- Christine
- Whatever next?
- It's all a ploy to help Christine
- This is insane
I know who sent this The vicomte, her lover
- Indeed!
Can you believe this?
- Signora
- Signora
- You are our star
- And always will be
- Signora
- The man is mad
- We don't take orders
Miss Daae will be playing the pageboy, the silent role.
Carlotta will be playing the lead
- It's useless trying to appease me
- Appease her
- You're only saying this to please me
- To please her
- Who scorn his word, beware to those
- You have reviled me
- The angel sees, the angel knows
- You have rebuked me
- Signora, pardon us
- You have replaced me
Please, signora, we beseech you
- I must see her
- This hour shall see your darkest fears
- The angel knows, the angel hears
- Where did she go?
Signora, sing for us Don't be a martyr
- What new surprises lie in store?
- Our star!
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?
Miss Daae?
Your public needs you.
We need you too.
Would you not rather have your precious little ingénue?
- Signora, no.
- Signora, no.
The world wants you
Prima donna first lady of the stage
Your devotees Are on their knees
To implore you
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you
Prima donna enchant us once again
- Think of your muse
- And of the queues round the theater
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna once more
- Christine spoke of an angel
- Prima donna
Your song shall live again
- Think of your public
- You took a snub
- But there's a public who needs you
- She has heard the voice
- Of the Angel of Music
- Those who hear your voice
- Liken you to an angel
- Think of their cry of undying support
- We get our opera
- She gets her limelight
- Follow where the limelight leads you
- Leading ladies are a trial
Prima donna Your song shall never die
- You'll sing again and to unending ovation
- Orders, warnings
- Lunatic demands
- Lunatic demands are regular occurrences
Think how you'll shine in that final encore
Surely there'll be further scenes worse than this
I must see these demands are rejected
Who'd believe a diva happy To relieve a chorus girl
Who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette entwined in love's duet
Although he may demur he must have been with her
You'd never get away with all this in a play
But if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue
It's just the sort of story audiences adore
- In fact, a perfect opera
- For if his curse is on the opera
Prima donna, the world is at your feet
A nation waits and how it hates to be cheated
Light up the stage with that age-old rapport
Sing, prima donna
Once more
Go on, go, go.
They say that this youth has set my lady's heart aflame
His Lordship, sure would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughingstock
Should he suspect her, God protect her shame, shame, shame
This faithless lady's bound for Hades
Shame, shame, shame
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect
Why, who can this be?
Gentle wife Admit your loving husband
That's exactly the sort of thing the public loves.
My love, I'm called to England on affairs of state
And must leave you with your new maid
Though I would happily take the maid with me.
The old fool is leaving.
It's the Countess de Charbourg.
She's invited us to her salon, you know.
Nothing like that ever happened in the junk business.
Scrap metal.
Serafimo, away with this pretense
You cannot speak but kiss me in my husband's absence
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
Time I tried to get a better better half
Poor fool, he doesn't know
If he knew the truth he'd never ever go
Did I not instruct that box five was to be kept empty?
He's here, the Phantom of the Opera.
- It's him.
- Your part is silent, little toad.
A toad, madame?
Perhaps it is you who are the toad.
Why you spray on my chin all the time, huh?
Serafimo, away with this pretense
You cannot speak but kiss me in my...
Gentlemen, please, please.
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
She's lost her voice.
Mother!
Bring the curtain in, please, will you?
Get off.
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize.
The performance will continue in 10 minutes' time when the role of the countess will be played by Miss Daae.
Thank you.
Go, go, hurry up.
Hurry up.
Until then, we would crave your indulgence for a few moments.
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act 3 of tonight's opera.
- What?
- Maestro the ballet, bring it forward, please.
- The ballet.
- The ballet, now, please.
Thank you.
You're fired.
- Are you all right?
- Raoul, we're not safe here.
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It's simply an accident.
An accident.
Why have you brought me here?
- We can't go back there
- We must return
He'll kill you His eyes will find us there
- Christine, don't say that
- Those eyes that burn
- Don't even think it
- If he has to kill a thousand men
- Forget this waking nightmare
- The Phantom of the Opera will kill
Believe me There is no Phantom of the Opera
My God, who is this man who hunts to kill?
- This mask of death
- I can't escape from him
- Whose is this voice you hear
- I never will
- With every breath?
- And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
- The Phantom of the Opera is here
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind
There is no Phantom of the Opera
Raoul, I've been there to his world of unending night
To a world where the daylight dissolves into darkness
Darkness
Raoul, I've seen him
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed it was hardly a face in that darkness
Darkness
But his voice filled my spirit with a strange, sweet sound
In that night there was music in my mind
And through music my soul began to soar
And I heard...
- ... as I'd never heard before
- What you heard was a dream and nothing more
Yet in his eyes
All the sadness of the world
Those pleading eyes that both threaten and adore
Christine
Christine
Christine...
No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here Nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here with you, beside you to guard you and to guide you
Say you love me
Every waking moment
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you
Now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
- That's all I ask of you
- Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe No one will find you
Your fears are far behind you
All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you always beside me
To hold me and to hide me
Then say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Let me lead you
From your solitude
Say you need me with you
Here beside you
Anywhere you go Let me go too
Christine
That's all I ask of you
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
- Say you love me
- You know I do
Love me
That's all I ask of you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
Love me
That's all I ask of you
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Come with me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses
Be with them at the door
And soon you'll be beside me
You'll guard me and you'll guide me
I gave you my music made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing
Christine
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
You will curse the day
You did not do
All that the Phantom
Asked of you
Monsieur Andre.
Monsieur Firmin.
Dear Andre, what a splendid party
The prologue to a bright new year
- Quite a night, I'm impressed
- Well, one does one's best
- Here's to us
- The toast of all the city
What a pity that The Phantom can't be here
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face So the world will never find you
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade
Masquerade
Look around There's another mask behind you
Flash of mauve, splash of puce fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest trace of rouge, face of beast
- Faces!
Take your turn
- Take a ride
- On the merry-go-round
- In an inhuman race
Eye of gold, thigh of blue true is false, who is who?
Curl of lip, swirl of gown ace of hearts, face of clown
Faces!
Drink it in, drink it up
Till you've drowned in the light, in the sound
But who can name the face?
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds Masquerade
Take your fill Let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you
Masquerade
Seething shadows, breathing lies
Masquerade
You can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade
Run and hide But a face will still pursue you
- What a night
- What a crowd
- Makes you glad
- Makes you proud
- All the creme de la creme
- Watching us watching them...
- Three months of relief - ... of delight
- Of Elysian peace
- And we can breathe at last
- No more notes
- No more ghost
- Here's to health
- Here's a toast to a prosperous year
- To our friends who are here
- And may our splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade
Think of it
A secret engagement.
Look, your future bride.
- Just think of it.
- But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me.
- No, Raoul.
Please don't.
They'll see.
- Let them see.
It's an engagement, not a crime.
Christine, what are you afraid of?
- Let's not argue
- Let's not argue
- Please pretend
- I can only hope
- You will understand in time
- I'll understand in time
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade Masquerade
Look around There's another mask behind you
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads Masquerade
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds Masquerade
Take your fill Let the spectacle astound you
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera
Here, I bring the finished score
Don Juan Triumphant
Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting round the stage
Our Don Juan must lose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn
That their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for our star
Miss Christine Daae
No doubt she'll do her best
It's true her voice is good
She knows, though Should she wish to excel
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me
Her teacher
Her teacher
Your chains are still mine!
You belong to me!
- Madame Giry...
- Please, I know no more than anyone else.
- That's not true!
- Monsieur, don't ask.
- There have been too many accidents.
- Accidents?
Please, Madame Giry for all our sakes.
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a traveling fair in the city.
Gypsies.
I was very young.
Studying to be a ballerina.
One of many.
Living in the dormitories of the opera house.
See the wonder from the East!
Come.
Come.
Come inside.
Come and see the Devil's Child.
Behold, mesdames and messieurs, the Devil's Child!
Devil's Child.
Murder!
- Murder!
- Which way?
!
That way!
That way!
He's getting away!
I hid him from the world and its cruelties.
He has known nothing else of life since then except this opera house.
It was his playground and now his artistic domain.
He's a genius.
He's an architect and designer.
He's a composer and a magician.
- A genius, monsieur.
- But clearly, Madame Giry genius has turned to madness.
- Monsieur.
- Where to?
The cemetery.
To my father's grave, please.
- Where have they gone?
- The cemetery.
In sleep, he sang to me
In dreams, he came
That voice, which calls to me and speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing.
Her father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.
Her father promised her.
Her father promised her.
You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered wishing you were somehow here again ... wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed somehow you would be here wishing I could hear your voice again ... knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do all that you dreamed I could
Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle
Too many years fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die?
Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive Teach me to live
Give me the strength to try
No more memories No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye
Help me say
Goodbye
Wandering child so lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father friend or phantom?
- Who is it there staring?
- Have you forgotten your angel?
Angel, oh, speak what endless longings
Echo in this whisper
Too long you've wandered in winter far from my fathering gaze
- Wildly, my mind beats against you
- You resist
- Yet your soul obeys
- Yet the soul obeys
- Angel of Music, you denied me
- Angel of Music, I denied you
- Turning from true beauty
- Turning from true beauty
- Angel of Music, do not shun me
- Angel of Music, my protector
- Come to your strange angel
- Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel...
- ... of Music
- No, Christine!
Wait!
Wait!
- Raoul!
- Whatever you believe, this man this thing is not your father!
No, Raoul!
No.
Not like this.
Now let it be war upon you both.
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance to ensnare our clever friend
- We're listening
- Go on
We shall play his game
Perform his work But remember, we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings he is certain to attend
- We are certain the doors are barred
- We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end
Raoul, I'm frightened.
Don't make me do this.
Raoul.
It scares me.
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me.
I know.
We'll be parted forever.
He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream I now dread.
If he finds me, it won't ever end.
And he'll always be there
Singing songs in my head
He'll always be there
Singing songs in my head
You said yourself
He was nothing but a man
Yet while he lives
He will haunt us
Till we're dead
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life to win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse
And yet, I wish I could
Oh, God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me in this, the Phantom's opera?
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope and every prayer rests on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin
Here the sire may serve the dam
Here the master takes his meat
Here the sacrificial lamb utters one despairing bleat
Poor young maiden
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets you will have to pay the bill tangled in the winding sheets
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that when tables, plans and maids are laid
Don Juan triumphs once again
Passarino, faithful friend once again recite the plan
Your young guest believes I'm you
I, the master You, the man
When you met you wore my cloak she could not have seen your face
She believes she dines with me in her master's borrowed place
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff stealing what, in truth, is mine
When it's late and modesty starts to mellow with the wine
You come home, I use your voice slam the door like crack of doom
I shall say, "Come hide with me where, oh, where?
Of course, my room!"
- Poor thing hasn't got a chance
- Here's my hat, my cloak and sword
Conquest is assured if I do not forget myself and laugh
No thoughts within her head but thoughts of joy
No dreams within her heart but dreams of love
Master?
Passarino
Go away, for the trap is set
And waits for its prey
You have come here in pursuit of your deepest urge
In pursuit of that wish which till now has been silent
Silent
I have brought you that our passions may fuse and merge
In your mind You've already succumbed to me
Dropped all defenses Completely succumbed to me
Now you are here with me
No second thoughts
You've decided
Decided
Past the point of no return
No backward glances
Our games of make-believe are at an end
Past all thought of "if" or "when "
No use resisting
Abandon thought
And let the dream descend
What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction lies before us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm, unspoken secrets
Will we learn?
Beyond the point of no return
You have brought me to that moment when words run dry ... to that moment when speech disappears into silence
Silence
I have come here
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined our bodies entwining Defenseless and silent
Now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided
Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion play has now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait
Before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race?
The sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flames at last
Consume us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no
Return
Say you'll share with me
One love
One lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you want me with you
Here beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go too
Christine
That's all I ask of...
Go!
Piangi, my love!
Oh, my God!
We're ruined, Andre.
Ruined!
Where did he take her?
Come with me.
I will take you to him.
But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes!
- I'll come with you!
- No, Meg, no.
You must stay here.
Come with me.
Do as I say.
No!
Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness
Deep as hell
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin but the wickedness of my abhorrent face!
Track down this murderer!
He must be found!
Track down this murderer!
He must be found!
Hounded out by everyone met with hatred everywhere
No kind words from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine
Why?
Why?
- Your hand at the level of your eyes
- At the level of your eyes
At the level of your eyes
This is as far as I dare go.
Thank you.
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
That fate which condemns me to wallow in blood has also denied me the joys of the flesh
This face, the infection which poisons our love
This face which earned a mother's fear and loathing
A mask
My first unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late
Turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this before your eyes
This haunted face holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies
Wait!
I think, my dear We have a guest
- Sir
- Raoul!
This is indeed an unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped
That you would come
And now, my wish comes true
- You have truly made my night
- Let me go.
Free her!
Do what you like Only free her!
- Have you no pity?
- Your lover makes a passionate plea
- Please, Raoul, it's useless
- I love her
Does that mean nothing?
I love her!
- Show some compassion
- The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine, Christine Let me see her
Be my guest, sir
Monsieur, I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay for the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now!
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes!
Nothing can save you now except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice!
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate grow cold and turn to tears of hate
Christine, forgive me Please, forgive me
- I did it all for you and all for nothing
- Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend
- We had such hopes
- Too late for turning back
- Now those hopes are shattered
- Too late for prayers and pity
- Say you love him
- All hope of cries for help
- And my life is over
- No point in fighting
- For either way you choose you cannot win
- But either way you choose he has to win
So do you end your days with me?
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
- Angel of Music
- Past the point of no return
- Christine, say no!
- Who deserves this?
- Don't throw your life away for my sake
- His life is now the prize...
- ... which you must earn
- I fought so hard to free you
- You've passed the point of no return
- Angel of Music
You deceived me
I gave you my mind blindly.
You try my patience.
Make your choice.
Pitiful creature of darkness
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you you are not alone
Track down this murderer
Take her!
Forget me Forget all of this
Leave me alone
Forget all you've seen
Go now Don't let them find you
Take the boat Swear to me never to tell the secrets you know of the angel in hell
The Phantom of the Opera is there Deep down below
Go now
Go now and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you
Christine, I love you
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me each night, each morning
You alone can make my song take flight
It's over now
The music of the night

Paris 1870
"Opera Populaire
"La Carlotta"
This trophy from our saviours,
From our saviours
From the enslaving force of Rome!
Madame
With feasting and dancing and song, tonight in celebration, we greet the victorious throng, returned to bring salvation!
Vicomte, welcome
The trumpets of Carthage resound!
Hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to our step on the ground!
Hear the drums
Hannibal comes!
Sad to return to find the land we love threatened once more by Roma's far-reaching grasp.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Rehearsals, as you see, are under way, for a new production of Chalumeau's 'Hannibal'.
M. Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
M. Reyer, Mme. Giry, ladies and gentlemen, please, if I can have your attention, thank you
As you know, for some weeks there have been rumours of my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you that these were all true, and it is my pleasure to introduce to you the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire, M. Richard Firmin and M. Gilles Andre.
I'm sure you've read that recent fortune in the junk business scrap metal, actually
He must be rich
And we're deeply honored to introduce our new patron, the Vicomte de Chagny
It's Raoul, before my father died,?
to see
I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts
He called me Little Lotte
Christine, he's so handsome
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts
Especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire
Gentlemen, Signora Carlitta Guidicelli our leading soprano for five seasons now.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honour, Signor.
I believe I'm keeping you for your rehearsal
I will be here this evening to share your great triumph
My apologies, monsieur
Thank you, M. Le Vicomte, once more if you please, Signor
He love me, he love me
He wouldn't recognize me
He didn't see you
If you please, monsieur
We take a particular pride in the excellence of our ballets, monsieur
I see why, especially that little blonde angel
My daughter, Meg Giry
And that exceptional beauty, no relation I trust
Christine Daae, promising talent M. Firmin, very promising
Daae, you say?
No relation to the famous Swedish violinist?
His only child, orphaned at seven when she came to live and trained in the ballet dormitories.
An orphan, you said?
I think of her as a daughter also
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side
Hannibals friends!
Oh no, not on my dress, why?
The trumpeting elephants sound - hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to their step on the ground - hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
Ah Daae, all that they want is your dancing
Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala
He's excited by dancing girls as your new managers
Because I will not be singing
Goodbye, everyone
Now it's finished
Get my doggie, bring my doggie.
Bye bye
What do we do?
- Grovel, grovel, grovel
- Right
See you later, because I'm going out
It is finished
Principessa.
Bella diva
- Si si
- Goddess of song
Mr. Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elisa in Act Three of 'Hannibal'?
Yes, yes, yes.
Ma no!
Because I have not my costume for act 3 because somebody not finish it!
And I hate my hat!
I wonder, Signora, as a personal favour if you would oblige us with a private rendition
Unless, of course, M. Reyer objects...
No.
Aspetta, aspetta.
If my managers command...
M. Reyer?
if My diva commands?
Yes, I do
Everybody be quite
Monsieur Lefevre, why exactly are you retiring?
My house I see
You as well
Signora?
Maestro.
Think of me, think of me, fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again
You long to take your heart...
Signora!
He's here:the Phantom of the Opera...
Signora!
Are you all right?
Buquet!
For God's sake, man, what's going on there?
Please, monsieur,don't look at me:
as God's my judge,I was not at my post.
Please, monsieur, there's no one there:
Or if there is, well then, it must be a ghost...
Signora, these things do happen.
For the past years, these things do happen
And did you stop them from happening?
No!
And you too, you are as bad as them, these things do happen
Until you stop these things from happening
This thing does not happen!
Ubaldo!
Andiamo!
Bring my doggy, and my boxy
Amateurs!
Now you see.
Byebye I'm leaving
Gentlemen.
Good luck.
If you need me, I should be in Australia.
Signora Guidicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?
You think so, monsieur?
I have a message, sir, from the Opera Ghost.
God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
He welcomes you to his opera house
His opera house?
And commands that you continue to?
leave Box Five empty for his use and reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Monsieur Lefevre used to give him twenty thousand francs a month.
Twenty thousand francs?
Perhaps you can afford more, with the Vicomte de Chagny as your patron.
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight when the Vicomte was to join us at the gala
But obviously we shall now have to cancel as it appears we have lost our star.
There should be a understudy
Understudy?
There is no understudy for La Calatta
A full house, Andre, we shall have to refund a full house.
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.
The chorus girl?
Don't be silly
She's been taking lessons from a great teacher.
Who?
I don't know his name, monsieur
Let her sing for you, monsieur.
She has been well taught.
Alright, come on, don't be shy, come on, come on
Just, just...
- From the beginning of the aria, mademoiselle
Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
She's very pretty
Think of me, think of me fondly, when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while - please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long to take your heart back and be free if you ever find a moment spare a thought for me...
We never said our love was evergreen,
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember,
Stop and think of me...
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen -
Don't think about the ways things might have been...
Think of me, think of me waking silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard to put you from my mind
Recall those days, look back on all those times
Thinks of the things, we'll never do
There will never be a day when I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seem so long ago,
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me, but I remember her
Flower fade, the fruit of summer fade
They have the season so do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me!
Bravo
Ma musica, splendide
"Gustave Daae"
Bravo, bravo, bravissimi
Christine, Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor
Meg
When your mother brought me here to live
Whenever I come down here alone
To light a candle for my father
A voice from above
And in my dreams
He was always there
You see, when my father lay dying
He told me I will be protected by an angel
An angel of music
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father tutored you?
who... who
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing, I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you are talking in riddles
And it's not like you
Angle of Music
Guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory Who is this angel
This...
Angle of Music
Hide no longer
Secret and strange and joy
He's with me, even now
Your hands are cold
All around you
Your face, Christine, is white
It frightens me
Don't be frightened
No, no
You did very well, my dear
He's pleased with you
Ah, Vicomte, I think we've made quite a discovery with Miss Daae
Perhaps we can present her to you, dear Vicomte
Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind, this is one visitor I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you
It would appear they've met before Yes
Little Lotte let her mind wander
Little Lottie thought:
Am I fonder of dolls or of goblins of shoes Raoul or of riddles of frocks
Those picnics in the attic or of chocolates
Father playing the violin
As we read to each other dark stories of the North
No - what I love best, Lottie said, is when I'm asleep in my bed and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
'
The Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
'
Oh, you're so like an angel tonight
Father said, 'When I'm in heaven, child
I will send the Angel of Music to you'.
Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I have been visited by the Angel of Music.
Oh, no doubt of it
- And now we'll go to supper!
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.
Well, I shan't keep you up late!
Raoul, no
You must change.
I'll order my carriage.
Two minutes
- Little Lottie.
No, Raoul, wait!
Insolent boy!
This slave of fashion basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool!
This brave young suitor, sharing in my triumph!
Angel!
I hear you!
Speak, I listen... stay by my side, guide me!
Angel, my soul was weak - forgive me... enter at last, Master!
Flattering child you shall know me, see why in shadow I hide!
Look at your face in the mirror -
I am there inside!
Angel of Music!
Guide and guardian!
Grant to me your glory!
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me:
Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
I am your Angel of Music Christine, Christine
Come to me:
Angel of Music
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear...
Your/My spirit and your/my voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
I have brought you to the seat of sweet music's throne to this kingdom where all must pay homage to music music
You have come here, for one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing,
I have needed you with me, to serve me, to sing, for my music... my music...
Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation.
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.
Silently the senses abandon their defences
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour.
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender.
Turn your face away from the garish light of day,
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light - and listen to the music of the night...
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams!
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before!
Close your eyes,let your spirit start to soar!
And you'll live as you've never lived before
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind, in this darkness that you know you cannot fight the darkness of the music of the night.
Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world!
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before!
Let your soul take you where you long to be!
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication!
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation!
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
Christine
Like yellow parchment is his skin...
A great black hole served as the nose that never grew...
You must be always on your guard, or he will catch you with his magical lasso!
Those who speak of what they know
Find, too late, that prudent silence is wise.
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I remember there was mist swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around, and on the lake there was a boat, and in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows
Whose is the face in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora!
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah!
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free!
Damn you...
Curse you...
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look or bear to think of me:
this loathsome gargoyle, who burns in bell, but secretly yearns for heaven, secretly...
Christine...
Fear can turn to love - you'll learn to see to find the man behind the monster:
this repulsive carcass, who seems a beast but secretly dreams of beauty, secretly...
Oh, Christine...
Come we must return
Those two fools Who run my theatre Will be missing you.
"Mystery after gala night,"
It says, "Mystery of soprano's flight!"
"Mystified all the papers say, we are mystified - we suspect foul play!"
Bad news on soprano scene -
First Carlotta, now Christine!
Still, at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold...
What a way to run a business!
Spare me these unending trials!
Half your cast disappears, but the crowd still cheers!
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hint!
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!
Andre, please don't shout...
It's publicity!
And the take is vast!
Free publicity!
But we have no cast...
Andre, have you seen the queue?
Oh, it seems you've got one too
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala!
Christine was in the world's sublime!
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left -
On that note the diva is a disaster must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime!
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder:
my salary has not been paid.
Send it care of the ghost, by return of post
P.T.O.:
No-one likes a debtor, so it's better if my orders are obeyed!"
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain!
These are both signed "O.G."...
Who the hell is he?
Opera ghost!
It's nothing short of shocking
He's mucking our position!
In addition he wants money
What a funny aberration to expect a large retainer!
Nothing plainer -he is clearly quite insane!
Where is she?
You mean Carlotta?
I mean Miss Daae -where is she?
Well, how should we know?
I want an answer -
I take it that you sent me this note
What's all this nonsense?
Of course not!
Don't look at us!
She's not with you, then?
Of course not!
We're in the dark...
Monsieur, don't argue -
Isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it, that we're meant to have wrote?
Written!
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again. "
If you didn't write it, who did?
Where is he?
Ah, welcome back!
Your precious patron - where is he?
What is it now?
I have your letter - a letter which I rather resent!
And did you send it?
Of course not!
As if he would!
You didn't send it?
Of course not!
What's going on?
You dare to tell me, that this is not the letter you sent?
!
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune, should you attempt to take her place. "
Far too many notes for my taste - and most of them about Christine!
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name...
Miss Daae has returned
I hope no words for as far as we're concerned
Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best that she was alone...
She needed rest
May I see her?
No, monsieur, she will see no-one.
Will she sing?
Here, I have a note...
Let me see it!
Please!
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature, detailing how my theatre is to be run.
You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance..."
Christine Daae has returned to you, and I am anxious her career should progress.
In the new production of "Il Muto", you will therefore cast Carlotta as the Pageboy, and put Miss Daae in the role of Countess.
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal.
The role of the Pageboy is silent - which makes my casting, in a word, ideal.
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in Box Five, which will be kept empty for me.
Should these commands be ignored, a disaster beyond your imagination will occur.
"I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, O.G."
Christine!
It's all a ploy to help Christine!
Whatever next...?
It's all about a ploy to help Christine
This is insane...
I know who sent this:
The Vicomte - her lover!
Indeed?
Can you believe this?
Signora!
O traditori!
This is a joke!
This changes nothing!
O mentitori!
Signora!
You are our star!
And always will be!
Signora...
The man is mad!
We don't take orders!
Miss Daae will be playing the Pageboy - the silent role...
Carlotta will be playing the lead!
It's useless trying to appease me!
You're only saying this to please me!
Signori, e vero?
Non, non, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!
Who scorn his word, beware to those...
You have reviled me!
The angel sees, the angel knows
You have rebuked me!
Signora, pardon us...?
You have replaced me!
Please, Signora, we beseech you...
This hour shall see your darkest fears...
Signora, sing for us!
Don't be a martyr
What new surprises lie in store?
Our star...!
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?
Miss Daae
Your public needs you!
We need you, too!
Would you not rather have your precious little ingenue?
Signora, no!
The world wants you!
Prima donna first lady of the stage!
Your devotees are on their knees to implore you!
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you!
Prima donna, enchant us once again!
Think of your muse...
And of the queues round the theatre!
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Christine spoke of an angel...
Prima donna, your song shall live again!
- Think of your public!
- You took a snub, but there's a public who needs you!
- She has heard the voice of the angel of music...
- Those who hear your voice liken you to an angel!
Think of their cry of undying support!
We get our opera
She gets her limelight!
Leading ladies are a trial!
Prima donna, your song shall never die!
You'll sing again, and to unending ovation!
- Orders!
Warnings!
Lunatic demands!
- Tears... oaths...
lunatic demands are regular occurrences!
Think how you'll shine in that final encore!
Surely there'll be further scenes worse than this!
Think, before these demands are rejected!
Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve a chorus girl, who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette, entwined in love's duet!
Although he may deny, he must have been with her!
You'd never get away with all this in a play, but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue it's just the sort of story audiences adore, in fact a perfect opera!
Prima donna the world is at your feet!
A nation waits, and how it hates to be cheated!
Light up the stage with that age old rapport!
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Oh, go go
They say that this youth has set my Lady's heart aflame!
His Lordship, sure, would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughing-stock!
Should he suspect her, God protect her!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
This faithless lady's bound for HADES!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
Serafimo - your disguise is perfect.
Who can this be?
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband.
That's exactly something the public loves
My love
- I am called to England on affairs of State, and must leave you with your new maid.
Though I'd happily take the maid with me.
The old fool is leaving!
That's the Countess de Cherbourg
She's invited us to her salon, you know
Nothing like that will endorse our junk business
Scrap metal
Serafimo - away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence!
Poor fool, he makes me laugh!
Haha,Haha...
Time I tried to get a better better half!
Poor fool, he doesn't know!
Hoho, Hoho...
If he knew the truth, he'd never, ever go!
Did I not instruct that Box Five was to be kept empty?
He's here: the Phantom of the Opera...
It's him
Your part is silent, little toad!
A toad, madame?
Perhaps it is you who are the toad...
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my...
Poor fool, he makes me laugh -
Hahahahaha!
?
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize, the performance will continue in ten minutes' time when the role of the Countess will be played by Miss Daae.
Until then, we will crave your indulgence for a few moments
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.
what?
Maestro, the ballet, bring, please
The ballet
The ballet, now, please
One moment, thank you
Thank you
You're fired
Are you alright?
Raoul, we're not safe here
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It was an accident... simply an accident
Why have you brought us here?
Don't take me back there!
We must return!
He'll kill me!
His eyes will find me there!
Christine, don't say that...
Those eyes that burn!
Don't even think it...
And if he has to kill a thousand men -
Forget this waking nightmare...
The Phantom of the Opera will kill...
This phantom is a fable...
Believe me...
... and kill again!
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
My God, who is this man who hunts to kill...?
...this mask of death...?
I can't escape from him...
Whose is this voice you hear I never will!
...with every breath...?
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind the Phantom of the Opera is here:
inside your/my mind...
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
Raoul, I've been there - to his world of unending night...
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness... darkness...
Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face in that darkness... darkness...
But his voice filled my spirit with a strange, sweet sound...
In that night there was music in my mind...
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard as I'd never heard before...
What you heard was a dream and nothing more...
Yet in his eyes all the sadness of the world...
Those pleading eyes, that both threaten and adore...
Christine...
Christine...
Christine...
No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears.
I'm here, nothing can harm you - my words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom, let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here with you, beside you, to guard you and to guide you...
Say you love me every waking moment, turn my head with talk of summertime...
Say you need me with you now and always...
Promise me that all you say is true that's all I ask of you...
Let me be your shelter, let me be your light.
You're safe:
No one will find you your fears are far behind you...
All I want is freedom, a world with no more night... and you, always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... let me lead you from your solitude...
Say you need me with you here, beside you... anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
Say you love me...
You know I do...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
Anywhere you go let me go too...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Come with me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!
And soon you'll be beside me!
You'll guard me, and you'll guide me...
I gave you my music... made your song take wing... and now how you've repaid me:
denied me and betrayed me...
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing...
Christine...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You will curse the day you did not do all that the Phantom asked of you...!
"Bal Masque"
M'sieur Andre?
M'sieur Firmin?
Dear Andre, what a splendid party!
The prologue to a bright new year!
Quite a night!
I'm impressed!
Well, one does one's best...
Here's to us!
The toast for the city
What a pity that 'Phantom' can't be here.
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade..
Masquerade!
Look around - there's another mask behind you!
Flash of mauve..
Splash of puce...
Fool and king...
Ghoul and goose...
Green and black...
Queen and priest...
Trace and rouge...
Face of beast...
Faces...
Take your turn, take a ride on the merry-go-round... in an inhuman race...
Eye of gold...
Thigh of blue...
True is false...
Who is who...?
Crul of lip...
Swirl of gown...
Ace of hearts...
Face of clown...
Faces...
Drink it in, drink it up, till you've drowned in the light... in the sound...
But who can name the face...
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Seething shadows, breathing lies...
Masquerade!
You can fool any friend who ever knew you!
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes...
Masquerade!
Run and hide - but a face will still pursue you!
What a night!
What a crowd!
Makes you glad!
Makes you proud!
All the creme de la creme!
Watching us watching them!
And all our fears are in the past!
Six months...
Of relief!
Of delight!
Of Elysian peace!
And we can breathe at last!
No more notes!
No more ghosts!
Here's a health!
Here's a toast: to a prosperous year!
To the new chandelier!
to the hear
And may its splendour never fade!
Six months!
What a joy!
What a change!
What a blessed release!
And what a masquerade!
Think of it!
A secret engagement!
Look - your future bride!
Just think of it!
But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me
No, Raoul, please don't do this
Well, let them see
It's an engagement, not a crime!
Christine, What are you afraid of?
Let's not argue...
Let's not argue...
Please pretend...
I can only hope I'll...
You will understand in time...
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade!
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade!
Masquerade!
Look around -
There's another mask behind you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera!
Here I bring the finished score
"Don Juan Triumphant"!
Fondest greetings to you all!
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts:
Carlotta must be taught to act, not her normal trick of strutting round the stage.
Our Don Juan must lose some weight - it's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age.
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office, not the arts.
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...
No doubt she'll do her best - it's true her voice is good.
She knows, though, should she wish to excel she has much still to learn, if pride will let her return to me
Her teacher, her teacher...
Your chains are still mine
You belong to me
Madame Giry.
Madame Giry...
Please, Monsieur, I know no more than anyone else.
That's not true.
Monsieur, don't ask, there have been too many accidents
Accidents?
Please, Madame Giry, for all our sakes...
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a travelling fair in the city.
Gypsies
I was very young, studying to be a ballerina
One of many
Living in the dormitory of the opera house
Come, come, come inside
Come and see the devil's child
?
the devil's child
Devil's child
Murder, murder
Which way?
...way
I have hidden him from the world and its cruelty is
He has known nothing else of life since then
Except this opera house
It was his playground and now his artistic domain
He's a genius, he's an architect and designer
He's a composer and a magician
A genius, monsieur
But clearly, Madame Giry, genius has turned to madness
Monsieur
Ou vas tu, mademoiselle?
The cemetery
To my father's grave, please
Where have they gone?
Oh, the cemetery
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing
Her Father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.
Her father promised her...
Her father promised her
You were once my one companion... you were all that mattered...
You were once a friend and father - then my world was shattered...
Wishing you were somehow here again... wishing you were somehow near...
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed, somehow you would be here...
Wishing I could hear your voice again... knowing that I never would...
Dreaming of you won't help me to do, all that you dreamed I could!
Passing bells and sculpted angels, cold and monumental.
Seem, for you, the wrong companions, you were warm and gentle.
Too many years fighting back tears, why can't the past just die!
Wishing you were somehow here again, knowing we must say goodbye!
Try to forgive, teach me to live!
Give me the strength to try!
No more memories, no more silent tears!
No more gazing across the wasted years!
Help me say goodbye... help me say goodbye!
Wandering child,
So lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father?
Friend or phantom?
Who is it there, staring?
Have you forgotten your Angel?
Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze
Wildly my mind beats against you
You resist
Yet your/the soul obeys...
Angel of Music!
You denied me/I denied you
Turning from true beauty
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protector
Come to me/your strange Angel...
I am your Angel of Music...
Come to me;
Angel of Music No, Christine, wait!
Wait!
Raoul!
Whatever you believe, this man - this thing - is not your father!
No, Raoul, no
Not like this
Now, let it be war upon you both!
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance
To ensnare our clever friend
We're listening...
Go on.
We shall play his game
Perform his work, but remember we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend
We are certain the doors are barred
We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end!
Raoul, I'm frightened...
Don't make me do this
Raoul, it scares me,
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me, I know
We'll be parted forever...
He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream, I now dread.
If he finds me, it won't ever end.
And he'll always be there, singing songs in my head...
He'll always be there, singing songs in my head...
You said yourself,
He was nothing but a man...
Yet while he lives,
He will haunt us 'til we're dead.
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse...
And yet, I wish I could
Oh God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me
In this, the Phantom's opera
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope, and every prayer rests on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin!
"Don Juan"
Here the sire may serve the dam, here the master takes his meat!
Here the sacrificial lamb utters one despairing bleat!
Poor young maiden!
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets you will have to pay the bill - tangled in the winding sheets!
Serve the meal and serve the maid!
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that, when tables, plans and maids are laid,
Don Juan triumphs once again!
Passarino, faithful friend, once again recite the plan.
Your young guest believes I'm you -
I, the master, you, the man
When you met you wore my cloak, she cannot see your face.
She believes she dines with me, in her master's borrowed place!
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff, stealing what, in truth, is mine.
When it's late and modesty starts to mellow, with the wine...
You come home!
I use your voice - slam the door like crack of doom!
I shall say: "come - hide with me!
Where, oh, where?
Of course - my room!"
Poor thing hasn't got a chance!
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword.
Conquest is assured, if I do not forget myself and laugh...
No thoughts within her head, but thoughts of joy!
No dreams within her heart but dreams of love!
Master?
Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for its prey...
You have come here in pursuit of your deepest urge, in pursuit of that wish, which till now has been silent, silent...
I have brought you, that our passions may fuse and merge - in your mind you've already succumbed to me dropped all defences completely succumbed to me - now you are here with me:
no second thoughts, you've decided,
decided...
Past the point of no return - no backward glances:
Our games of make-believe are at an end
Past all thought of "if" or "when" - no use resisting:
abandon thought, and let the dream descend...
What raging fire shall flood the soul
What rich desire unlocks its door
What sweet seduction lies before us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets
Will we learn beyond the point of no return?
You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech disappears
Into silence
Silence.
I have come here,
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent,
Now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided.
Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion-play has now at last begun.
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race
The sleeping bud burst into bloom
When will the flames at last consume us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return.
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you'll want me
With you here
Beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go too
Christine that's all I ask of...
Go!
Oh,?
You left before me
Oh my God
We'll run, Andre, run
Where did he take her?
Come with me, monsieur
I will take you to him
But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I'll go with you
No, Meg, you must stay here
Come with me, monsieur
No!
Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness, deep as hell
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin but the wickedness of my abhorrent face
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Hounded out by everyone
Met with hatred everywhere
No kind words from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine
Why, why...?
Your hand at the level of your eyes
This is as far as I dare go
Thank you
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
That fate, which condemns me to wallow in blood
Has also denied me the joys of the flesh...
This face, the infection which poisons our love...
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing
A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late
Turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this before your eyes
This haunted face holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies
Wait!
I think, my dear, we have a guest
Sir!
- Raoul!
This is indeed an unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped that you would come
And now my wish comes true
You have truly made my night!
Let me go!
Free her
Do what you like, only free her
Have you no pity?
Your lover makes a passionate plea
Please, Raoul, it's useless
I love her
Does that mean nothing?
I love her
Show some compassion
The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine...
Let me see her
Be my guest, sir...
Monsieur, I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay for the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes
Nothing can save you now, except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love!
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice,
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate,
Grow cold and turn to tears of hate
Christine, forgive me, please forgive me
I did it all for you, and all for nothing...
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered Too late for turning back, Too late for prayers and useless pity
Say you love him, and my life is over!
All hope of cries for help, No point in fighting
For either way you choose, You cannot win Either way you choose, he has to win
So do you end your days with me
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
Angel of Music...
Past the point of no return...
Christine say no!
Who deserved this?
Don't throw your life away for my sake!
The final threshold...
His life is now the prize which you must earn!
Why do you curse mercy?
I fought so hard to free you...
Angel of Music... you deceived me You've passed the point of no return!
I gave you my mind blindly
You try my patience,
Make your choice!
Pitiful creature of darkness,
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you,
You are not alone...
Track down this murderer, he must be found!
Take her, forget me,
Forget all of this...
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground!
Leave me alone - forget all you've seen...
Go now - don't let them find you!
Take the boat, swear to me, never to tell
The secret you know, of the angel in hell!
Go now - go now and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you...
Christine, I love you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You alone, can make my song take flight
It's over now, the music of the night
"Countess de Chagny Beloved wife and mother"
"Chrisine 1854-1917"
Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness
Who will be there for you
Comfort and care for you
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion
Never dreamed out in the world
There are arms to hold you?
You've always known
Your heart was on its own
So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone
Learn to be lonely
Life can be lived
Life can be loved
Alone.

A collector's piece indeed
Every detail
Exactly as she said
Will you still play When all the rest of us are dead?
Lot 666, then.
A chandelier in pieces.
Some of you may recall the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera.
A mystery never fully explained.
We're told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the very chandelier which figures in the famous disaster.
Our workshops have repaired it and wired parts of it for the new electric light.
Perhaps we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago with a little illumination.
Gentlemen?
The trophy From our saviors
From our saviors
From the enslaving force of Rome!
Madame.
With feasting and dancing and song
Tonight in celebration we greet the victorious throng
Returned to bring salvation!
I've got them, monsieur.
Vicomte, welcome.
The trumpets of Carthage resound
Hear, Romans, now and tremble
Hark to our step on the ground
Hear the drums Hannibal comes!
You make my dress train too long.
Sad to return to find the land we love
Threatened once more by Roma's far-reaching grasp
Gentlemen, gentlemen...
Rehearsals are under way for a new production of Chalumeau's Hannibal.
- Monsieur Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
- Monsieur Reyer, Madame Giry ladies and gentlemen, please, if I could have your attention?
As you know, there have been rumors of my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you that these were all true, and it is my pleasure to introduce you to the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire Monsieur Richard Firmin and Monsieur Gilles Andre.
I'm sure you have read of their recent fortune in the junk business.
Scrap metal, actually.
They must be rich.
And we are deeply honored to introduce our new patron.
The Vicomte de Chagny.
I still can't believe we managed to get him.
It's such a coup for us, my dear.
It's Raoul.
Before my father died, at the house by the sea I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts.
- He called me Little Lotte.
- Christine, he's so handsome.
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire.
Gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli, our leading soprano for five seasons.
- Brava!
Brava!
- Brava!
Brava!
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honor, signor.
I believe I'm keeping you from your rehearsal.
I will be here this evening to share your great triumph.
My apologies.
Thank you, monsieur.
- Once more if you please, signor.
- He love me.
He love me.
Thank you, indeed, for the wonderful words.
So inspiring and encouraging...
He wouldn't recognize me.
- He didn't see you.
- If you please.
Monsieur.
We take particular pride in the excellence of our ballet.
I see why.
Especially that little blond angel.
My daughter, Meg Giry.
And that exceptional beauty.
No relation, I trust?
Christine Daae.
Promising talent, Monsieur Firmin.
Very promising.
Daae, did you say?
No relation to the famous Swedish violinist?
His only child.
Orphaned at 7 when she came to live and train in the ballet dormitories.
An orphan, you say?
I think of her as a daughter also.
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side.
Hannibal's friends!
Ah, me!
Not on my dress!
Why?
The trumpeting elephants sound
Hear, Romans, now and tremble
Hark to their step on the ground
Hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
All day!
All they want is the dancing!
Well, the Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala.
I hope he is as excited by dancing girls as your new managers because I will not be singing!
Get my doggy, bring my doggy.
Bye-bye.
- What do we do?
- Grovel.
- Grovel, grovel.
- Right.
- I'm going now.
It is finished.
- World-renowned artist and great beauty.
Bella diva.
Goddess of song.
Monsieur Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elissa in Act 3 of Hannibal?
Perhaps the signora...
Because I have not my costume for Act 3.
Because somebody not finish it!
And I hate my hat!
Signora, as a personal favor, would you oblige us with a private rendition?
Unless, of course, Monsieur Reyer objects.
If my managers command.
- Monsieur Reyer?
- If my diva commands.
Yes, I do.
Everybody, very quiet.
- Monsieur, why exactly are you retiring?
- My health.
- I see.
- You as well!
Signora.
Maestro.
Think of me Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again you long to take your heart back
And be free...
- Oh, my God, signora!
- I hate you.
- Lift it up!
- He's here.
The Phantom of the Opera.
Signora, are you all right?
Buquet!
For God's sake, what's going on up there?
Please, monsieur, don't look at me.
As God's my judge, I wasn't at my post.
Please, monsieur, there's no one there.
Or if there is, well, then, it must be a ghost.
Signora, these things do happen.
For the past three years these things do happen.
And did you stop them from happening?
No!
And you two, you are as bad as him.
"These things do happen."
Until you stop these things from happening, this thing does not happen!
- Bring my doggy and my boxy.
- Amateurs.
Now you see.
Bye-bye, I'm really leaving.
Gentlemen, good luck.
If you need me, I shall be in Australia.
Signora Giudicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?
You think so, monsieur?
- I have a message from the Opera Ghost.
- Oh, God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
- He welcomes you to his opera house.
- His opera house?
And commands that you continue to leave box five empty for his use.
And reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Well, Monsieur Lefevre used to give him 20,000 francs a month.
Twenty thousand francs?
Perhaps you can afford more.
With the vicomte as your patron?
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight when the vicomte was to join us for the gala.
Obviously, we shall now have to cancel, as it appears we have lost our star!
- But surely there must be an understudy.
- There is no understudy for La Carlotta!
A full house, Andre.
We shall have to refund a full house!
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.
What, a chorus girl?
Don't be silly.
She has been taking lessons from a great teacher.
- Who?
- I don't know his name, monsieur.
Let her sing for you, monsieur.
She has been well taught.
All right.
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on, come along.
Just...
From the beginning of the aria then, please, mademoiselle.
- Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
- She's very pretty.
Think of me Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again you long to take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me
We never said our love was evergreen or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me
Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way
Things might have been
Think of me, think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard to put you from my mind
Recall those days Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago it seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me
But I remember her
Flowers fade The fruits of summer fade
They have their seasons So do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me
Brava!
Brava!
Brava, brava, bravissima
Christine, Christine
Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding?
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor?
Meg when your mother brought me here to live whenever I'd come down here alone to light a candle for my father a voice, from above and in my dreams, he was always there.
You see when my father lay dying he told me I would be protected by an angel.
An angel of music.
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father's coaching you?
Who else, Meg?
Who?
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius
Christine, you must have been dreaming stories like this can't come true
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you
Angel of Music Guide and guardian
- Grant to me your glory
- Who is this angel?
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer
- Secret and strange angel
- Secret and strange angel
He's with me even now
- Your hands are cold
- All around me
Your face, Christine, it's white
- It frightens me
- Don't be frightened
No.
No.
You did very well, my dear.
He is pleased with you.
- Vicomte.
- Vicomte.
We've made quiet a discovery with Miss Daae.
Perhaps we could present her to you, dear vicomte?
If you wouldn't mind, this is one visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you.
It would appear they've met before.
Little Lotte let her mind wander.
Little Lotte thought, "Am I fonder of dolls or of goblins or shoes?"
- Raoul.
- "Or of riddles or frocks?"
- Those picnics in the attic.
- "Or of chocolates?"
- Father playing the violin.
- As we read to each other dark stories of the North.
- No.
"What I love best," Lotte said, "is when I'm asleep in my bed."
And the Angel of Music sings songs in my head
The Angel of Music sings songs in my head
You sang like an angel tonight.
Father said:
"When I'm in heaven, child, I will send the Angel of Music to you."
Well, father is dead, Raoul.
And I have been visited by the Angel of Music.
No doubt of it.
And now we go to supper.
No, Raoul.
- The Angel of Music is very strict.
- Well, I shan't keep you up late.
Raoul, no.
You must change.
I'll order my carriage, Little Lotte.
No.
Raoul, wait!
Insolent boy, this slave of fashion
Basking in your glory
Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor
Sharing in my triumph
Angel, I hear you Speak, I listen
Stay by my side Guide me
Angel, my soul was weak Forgive me
Enter at last, master
Flattering child, you shall know me
See why in shadow I hide
Look at your face in the mirror
I am there inside!
Angel of Music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory
Angel of Music, hide no longer
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
- I am your Angel of Music
- Christine.
Christine!
Come to me, Angel of Music
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find...
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside your mind
Those who have seen your face draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
- Your spirit and my voice
- My spirit and your voice
- In one combined
- In one combined
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, my Angel of Music.
Sing, my angel.
Sing for me!
Sing, my angel.
Sing for me!
I have brought you
To the seat of sweet music's throne
To this kingdom where all must pay homage to music
Music, you have come here
For one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing
I have needed you with me to serve me, to sing
For my music
My music
Nighttime sharpens heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away
From cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes
Let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before
Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night
Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you
Where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in to the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make...
The music of the night
Christine?
Like yellow parchment is his skin
A great black hole serves as the nose that never grew
You must be always on your guard
Or he will catch you with his magical lasso
Oh, my.
Those who speak of what they know
Find too late that prudent silence is wise
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes.
I remember there was mist
Swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around
And on the lake there was a boat
And in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows?
Whose is the face in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora
You little demon!
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah
You little viper Now you cannot ever be free
Damn you!
Curse you!
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look or bear to think of me?
This loathsome gargoyle who burns in hell
But secretly yearns for heaven secretly, secretly
Christine
Fear can turn to love
You'll learn to see to find the man
Behind the monster, this
Repulsive carcass who seems a beast
But secretly dreams of beauty ... secretly, secretly
Oh, Christine
Come, we must return.
Those two fools who run my theater will be missing you.
"Mystery after gala night"
It says "Mystery of soprano's flight"
"Mystified" All the papers say
"We are mystified We suspect foul play"
Bad news on soprano scene first Carlotta, now Christine still at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold
What a way to run a business
Spare me these unending trials
Half your cast disappears but the crowd still cheers
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel Have a scandal
- And you're sure to have a hit
- Damnable, will they all walk out?
- This is damnable
- Andre, please don't shout
It's publicity, and the take is vast free publicity
But we have no cast
Andre, have you seen the queue?
It seems you've got one too
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala Christine was, in a word, sublime
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left
On that note, the diva's a disaster
Must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?"
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder
My salary has not been paid
Send it care of the Ghost by return of post PTO
No one likes a debtor so it's better if my orders are obeyed"
Who would have the gall to send this?
- Someone with a puerile brain
- These are both signed O.G.
- Who the hell is he?
- Opera Ghost
- It's nothing short of shocking
- He is mocking our position
- In addition he wants money
- What a funny apparition
To expect a large retainer he is clearly quite insane
- Where is she?
- Carlotta?
I mean, Miss Daae Where is she?
- How do we know?
- I want an answer
- You sent me this note
- What's this nonsense?
- Of course not
- Don't look at us
- She's not with you?
- Of course not
- We're in the dark
- Don't argue, isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it that we're meant to have wrote?
Written.
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again."
- If you didn't write it, who did?
- Where is he?
- Welcome back
- Your precious patron, where is he?
- What is it?
- I have your letter
- A letter I rather resent
- Did you send it?
- Of course not
- As if he would
- You didn't send it?
- Of course not
- What's going on?
- Tell me, this is not the letter you sent?
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune should you attempt to take her place."
Far too many notes for my taste
And most of them about Christine
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name
- Miss Daae has returned
- I hope no worse for wear
- As far as we're concerned
- Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best she was alone
She needed rest
- May I see her?
- No, monsieur, she will see no one
Will she sing?
Will she sing?
- Here, I have a note
- Let me see it
Please.
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature detailing how my theater is to be run.
You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance.
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress in the new production of II Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the pageboy
And put Miss Daae in the role of countess
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent which makes my casting in a word, ideal
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five which will be kept empty for me.
Should these commands be ignored a disaster beyond your imagination will occur.
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant.
O.G."
- Christine
- Whatever next?
- It's all a ploy to help Christine
- This is insane
I know who sent this The vicomte, her lover
- Indeed!
Can you believe this?
- Signora
- Signora
- You are our star
- And always will be
- Signora
- The man is mad
- We don't take orders
Miss Daae will be playing the pageboy, the silent role.
Carlotta will be playing the lead
- It's useless trying to appease me
- Appease her
- You're only saying this to please me
- To please her
- Who scorn his word, beware to those
- You have reviled me
- The angel sees, the angel knows
- You have rebuked me
- Signora, pardon us
- You have replaced me
Please, signora, we beseech you
- I must see her
- This hour shall see your darkest fears
- The angel knows, the angel hears
- Where did she go?
Signora, sing for us Don't be a martyr
- What new surprises lie in store?
- Our star!
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?
Miss Daae?
Your public needs you.
We need you too.
Would you not rather have your precious little ingénue?
- Signora, no.
- Signora, no.
The world wants you
Prima donna first lady of the stage
Your devotees Are on their knees
To implore you
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you
Prima donna enchant us once again
- Think of your muse
- And of the queues round the theater
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna once more
- Christine spoke of an angel
- Prima donna
Your song shall live again
- Think of your public
- You took a snub
- But there's a public who needs you
- She has heard the voice
- Of the Angel of Music
- Those who hear your voice
- Liken you to an angel
- Think of their cry of undying support
- We get our opera
- She gets her limelight
- Follow where the limelight leads you
- Leading ladies are a trial
Prima donna Your song shall never die
- You'll sing again and to unending ovation
- Orders, warnings
- Lunatic demands
- Lunatic demands are regular occurrences
Think how you'll shine in that final encore
Surely there'll be further scenes worse than this
I must see these demands are rejected
Who'd believe a diva happy To relieve a chorus girl
Who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette entwined in love's duet
Although he may demur he must have been with her
You'd never get away with all this in a play
But if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue
It's just the sort of story audiences adore
- In fact, a perfect opera
- For if his curse is on the opera
Prima donna, the world is at your feet
A nation waits and how it hates to be cheated
Light up the stage with that age-old rapport
Sing, prima donna
Once more
Go on, go, go.
They say that this youth has set my lady's heart aflame
His Lordship, sure would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughingstock
Should he suspect her, God protect her shame, shame, shame
This faithless lady's bound for Hades
Shame, shame, shame
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect
Why, who can this be?
Gentle wife Admit your loving husband
That's exactly the sort of thing the public loves.
My love, I'm called to England on affairs of state
And must leave you with your new maid
Though I would happily take the maid with me.
The old fool is leaving.
It's the Countess de Charbourg.
She's invited us to her salon, you know.
Nothing like that ever happened in the junk business.
Scrap metal.
Serafimo, away with this pretense
You cannot speak but kiss me in my husband's absence
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
Time I tried to get a better better half
Poor fool, he doesn't know
If he knew the truth he'd never ever go
Did I not instruct that box five was to be kept empty?
He's here, the Phantom of the Opera.
- It's him.
- Your part is silent, little toad.
A toad, madame?
Perhaps it is you who are the toad.
Why you spray on my chin all the time, huh?
Serafimo, away with this pretense
You cannot speak but kiss me in my...
Gentlemen, please, please.
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
She's lost her voice.
Mother!
Bring the curtain in, please, will you?
Get off.
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize.
The performance will continue in 10 minutes' time when the role of the countess will be played by Miss Daae.
Thank you.
Go, go, hurry up.
Hurry up.
Until then, we would crave your indulgence for a few moments.
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act 3 of tonight's opera.
- What?
- Maestro the ballet, bring it forward, please.
- The ballet.
- The ballet, now, please.
Thank you.
You're fired.
- Are you all right?
- Raoul, we're not safe here.
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It's simply an accident.
An accident.
Why have you brought me here?
- We can't go back there
- We must return
He'll kill you His eyes will find us there
- Christine, don't say that
- Those eyes that burn
- Don't even think it
- If he has to kill a thousand men
- Forget this waking nightmare
- The Phantom of the Opera will kill
Believe me There is no Phantom of the Opera
My God, who is this man who hunts to kill?
- This mask of death
- I can't escape from him
- Whose is this voice you hear
- I never will
- With every breath?
- And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
- The Phantom of the Opera is here
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind
There is no Phantom of the Opera
Raoul, I've been there to his world of unending night
To a world where the daylight dissolves into darkness
Darkness
Raoul, I've seen him
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed it was hardly a face in that darkness
Darkness
But his voice filled my spirit with a strange, sweet sound
In that night there was music in my mind
And through music my soul began to soar
And I heard...
- ... as I'd never heard before
- What you heard was a dream and nothing more
Yet in his eyes
All the sadness of the world
Those pleading eyes that both threaten and adore
Christine
Christine
Christine...
No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here Nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here with you, beside you to guard you and to guide you
Say you love me
Every waking moment
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you
Now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
- That's all I ask of you
- Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe No one will find you
Your fears are far behind you
All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you always beside me
To hold me and to hide me
Then say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Let me lead you
From your solitude
Say you need me with you
Here beside you
Anywhere you go Let me go too
Christine
That's all I ask of you
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
- Say you love me
- You know I do
Love me
That's all I ask of you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
Love me
That's all I ask of you
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Come with me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses
Be with them at the door
And soon you'll be beside me
You'll guard me and you'll guide me
I gave you my music made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing
Christine
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
You will curse the day
You did not do
All that the Phantom
Asked of you
Monsieur Andre.
Monsieur Firmin.
Dear Andre, what a splendid party
The prologue to a bright new year
- Quite a night, I'm impressed
- Well, one does one's best
- Here's to us
- The toast of all the city
What a pity that The Phantom can't be here
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face So the world will never find you
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade
Masquerade
Look around There's another mask behind you
Flash of mauve, splash of puce fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest trace of rouge, face of beast
- Faces!
Take your turn
- Take a ride
- On the merry-go-round
- In an inhuman race
Eye of gold, thigh of blue true is false, who is who?
Curl of lip, swirl of gown ace of hearts, face of clown
Faces!
Drink it in, drink it up
Till you've drowned in the light, in the sound
But who can name the face?
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds Masquerade
Take your fill Let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you
Masquerade
Seething shadows, breathing lies
Masquerade
You can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade
Run and hide But a face will still pursue you
- What a night
- What a crowd
- Makes you glad
- Makes you proud
- All the creme de la creme
- Watching us watching them...
- Three months of relief - ... of delight
- Of Elysian peace
- And we can breathe at last
- No more notes
- No more ghost
- Here's to health
- Here's a toast to a prosperous year
- To our friends who are here
- And may our splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade
Think of it
A secret engagement.
Look, your future bride.
- Just think of it.
- But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me.
- No, Raoul.
Please don't.
They'll see.
- Let them see.
It's an engagement, not a crime.
Christine, what are you afraid of?
- Let's not argue
- Let's not argue
- Please pretend
- I can only hope
- You will understand in time
- I'll understand in time
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade Masquerade
Look around There's another mask behind you
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads Masquerade
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds Masquerade
Take your fill Let the spectacle astound you
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera
Here, I bring the finished score
Don Juan Triumphant
Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting round the stage
Our Don Juan must lose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn
That their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for our star
Miss Christine Daae
No doubt she'll do her best
It's true her voice is good
She knows, though Should she wish to excel
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me
Her teacher
Her teacher
Your chains are still mine!
You belong to me!
- Madame Giry...
- Please, I know no more than anyone else.
- That's not true!
- Monsieur, don't ask.
- There have been too many accidents.
- Accidents?
Please, Madame Giry for all our sakes.
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a traveling fair in the city.
Gypsies.
I was very young.
Studying to be a ballerina.
One of many.
Living in the dormitories of the opera house.
See the wonder from the East!
Come.
Come.
Come inside.
Come and see the Devil's Child.
Behold, mesdames and messieurs, the Devil's Child!
Devil's Child.
Murder!
- Murder!
- Which way?
!
That way!
That way!
He's getting away!
I hid him from the world and its cruelties.
He has known nothing else of life since then except this opera house.
It was his playground and now his artistic domain.
He's a genius.
He's an architect and designer.
He's a composer and a magician.
- A genius, monsieur.
- But clearly, Madame Giry genius has turned to madness.
- Monsieur.
- Where to?
The cemetery.
To my father's grave, please.
- Where have they gone?
- The cemetery.
In sleep, he sang to me
In dreams, he came
That voice, which calls to me and speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing.
Her father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.
Her father promised her.
Her father promised her.
You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered wishing you were somehow here again ... wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed somehow you would be here wishing I could hear your voice again ... knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do all that you dreamed I could
Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle
Too many years fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die?
Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive Teach me to live
Give me the strength to try
No more memories No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye
Help me say
Goodbye
Wandering child so lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father friend or phantom?
- Who is it there staring?
- Have you forgotten your angel?
Angel, oh, speak what endless longings
Echo in this whisper
Too long you've wandered in winter far from my fathering gaze
- Wildly, my mind beats against you
- You resist
- Yet your soul obeys
- Yet the soul obeys
- Angel of Music, you denied me
- Angel of Music, I denied you
- Turning from true beauty
- Turning from true beauty
- Angel of Music, do not shun me
- Angel of Music, my protector
- Come to your strange angel
- Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel...
- ... of Music
- No, Christine!
Wait!
Wait!
- Raoul!
- Whatever you believe, this man this thing is not your father!
No, Raoul!
No.
Not like this.
Now let it be war upon you both.
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance to ensnare our clever friend
- We're listening
- Go on
We shall play his game
Perform his work But remember, we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings he is certain to attend
- We are certain the doors are barred
- We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end
Raoul, I'm frightened.
Don't make me do this.
Raoul.
It scares me.
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me.
I know.
We'll be parted forever.
He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream I now dread.
If he finds me, it won't ever end.
And he'll always be there
Singing songs in my head
He'll always be there
Singing songs in my head
You said yourself
He was nothing but a man
Yet while he lives
He will haunt us
Till we're dead
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life to win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse
And yet, I wish I could
Oh, God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me in this, the Phantom's opera?
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope and every prayer rests on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin
Here the sire may serve the dam
Here the master takes his meat
Here the sacrificial lamb utters one despairing bleat
Poor young maiden
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets you will have to pay the bill tangled in the winding sheets
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that when tables, plans and maids are laid
Don Juan triumphs once again
Passarino, faithful friend once again recite the plan
Your young guest believes I'm you
I, the master You, the man
When you met you wore my cloak she could not have seen your face
She believes she dines with me in her master's borrowed place
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff stealing what, in truth, is mine
When it's late and modesty starts to mellow with the wine
You come home, I use your voice slam the door like crack of doom
I shall say, "Come hide with me where, oh, where?
Of course, my room!"
- Poor thing hasn't got a chance
- Here's my hat, my cloak and sword
Conquest is assured if I do not forget myself and laugh
No thoughts within her head but thoughts of joy
No dreams within her heart but dreams of love
Master?
Passarino
Go away, for the trap is set
And waits for its prey
You have come here in pursuit of your deepest urge
In pursuit of that wish which till now has been silent
Silent
I have brought you that our passions may fuse and merge
In your mind You've already succumbed to me
Dropped all defenses Completely succumbed to me
Now you are here with me
No second thoughts
You've decided
Decided
Past the point of no return
No backward glances
Our games of make-believe are at an end
Past all thought of "if" or "when "
No use resisting
Abandon thought
And let the dream descend
What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction lies before us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm, unspoken secrets
Will we learn?
Beyond the point of no return
You have brought me to that moment when words run dry ... to that moment when speech disappears into silence
Silence
I have come here
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined our bodies entwining Defenseless and silent
Now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided
Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion play has now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait
Before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race?
The sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flames at last
Consume us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no
Return
Say you'll share with me
One love
One lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you want me with you
Here beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go too
Christine
That's all I ask of...
Go!
Piangi, my love!
Oh, my God!
We're ruined, Andre.
Ruined!
Where did he take her?
Come with me.
I will take you to him.
But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes!
- I'll come with you!
- No, Meg, no.
You must stay here.
Come with me.
Do as I say.
No!
Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness
Deep as hell
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin but the wickedness of my abhorrent face!
Track down this murderer!
He must be found!
Track down this murderer!
He must be found!
Hounded out by everyone met with hatred everywhere
No kind words from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine
Why?
Why?
- Your hand at the level of your eyes
- At the level of your eyes
At the level of your eyes
This is as far as I dare go.
Thank you.
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
That fate which condemns me to wallow in blood has also denied me the joys of the flesh
This face, the infection which poisons our love
This face which earned a mother's fear and loathing
A mask
My first unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late
Turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this before your eyes
This haunted face holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies
Wait!
I think, my dear We have a guest
- Sir
- Raoul!
This is indeed an unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped
That you would come
And now, my wish comes true
- You have truly made my night
- Let me go.
Free her!
Do what you like Only free her!
- Have you no pity?
- Your lover makes a passionate plea
- Please, Raoul, it's useless
- I love her
Does that mean nothing?
I love her!
- Show some compassion
- The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine, Christine Let me see her
Be my guest, sir
Monsieur, I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay for the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now!
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes!
Nothing can save you now except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice!
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate grow cold and turn to tears of hate
Christine, forgive me Please, forgive me
- I did it all for you and all for nothing
- Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend
- We had such hopes
- Too late for turning back
- Now those hopes are shattered
- Too late for prayers and pity
- Say you love him
- All hope of cries for help
- And my life is over
- No point in fighting
- For either way you choose you cannot win
- But either way you choose he has to win
So do you end your days with me?
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
- Angel of Music
- Past the point of no return
- Christine, say no!
- Who deserves this?
- Don't throw your life away for my sake
- His life is now the prize...
- ... which you must earn
- I fought so hard to free you
- You've passed the point of no return
- Angel of Music
You deceived me
I gave you my mind blindly.
You try my patience.
Make your choice.
Pitiful creature of darkness
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you you are not alone
Track down this murderer
Take her!
Forget me Forget all of this
Leave me alone
Forget all you've seen
Go now Don't let them find you
Take the boat Swear to me never to tell the secrets you know of the angel in hell
The Phantom of the Opera is there Deep down below
Go now
Go now and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you
Christine, I love you
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me each night, each morning
You alone can make my song take flight
It's over now
The music of the night

Paris 1870
"Opera Populaire
"La Carlotta"
This trophy from our saviours,
From our saviours
From the enslaving force of Rome!
Madame
With feasting and dancing and song, tonight in celebration, we greet the victorious throng, returned to bring salvation!
Vicomte, welcome
The trumpets of Carthage resound!
Hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to our step on the ground!
Hear the drums
Hannibal comes!
Sad to return to find the land we love threatened once more by Roma's far-reaching grasp.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Rehearsals, as you see, are under way, for a new production of Chalumeau's 'Hannibal'.
M. Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
M. Reyer, Mme. Giry, ladies and gentlemen, please, if I can have your attention, thank you
As you know, for some weeks there have been rumours of my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you that these were all true, and it is my pleasure to introduce to you the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire, M. Richard Firmin and M. Gilles Andre.
I'm sure you've read that recent fortune in the junk business scrap metal, actually
He must be rich
And we're deeply honored to introduce our new patron, the Vicomte de Chagny
It's Raoul, before my father died,?
to see
I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts
He called me Little Lotte
Christine, he's so handsome
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts
Especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire
Gentlemen, Signora Carlitta Guidicelli our leading soprano for five seasons now.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honour, Signor.
I believe I'm keeping you for your rehearsal
I will be here this evening to share your great triumph
My apologies, monsieur
Thank you, M. Le Vicomte, once more if you please, Signor
He love me, he love me
He wouldn't recognize me
He didn't see you
If you please, monsieur
We take a particular pride in the excellence of our ballets, monsieur
I see why, especially that little blonde angel
My daughter, Meg Giry
And that exceptional beauty, no relation I trust
Christine Daae, promising talent M. Firmin, very promising
Daae, you say?
No relation to the famous Swedish violinist?
His only child, orphaned at seven when she came to live and trained in the ballet dormitories.
An orphan, you said?
I think of her as a daughter also
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side
Hannibals friends!
Oh no, not on my dress, why?
The trumpeting elephants sound - hear, Romans, now and tremble!
Hark to their step on the ground - hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
Ah Daae, all that they want is your dancing
Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala
He's excited by dancing girls as your new managers
Because I will not be singing
Goodbye, everyone
Now it's finished
Get my doggie, bring my doggie.
Bye bye
What do we do?
- Grovel, grovel, grovel
- Right
See you later, because I'm going out
It is finished
Principessa.
Bella diva
- Si si
- Goddess of song
Mr. Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elisa in Act Three of 'Hannibal'?
Yes, yes, yes.
Ma no!
Because I have not my costume for act 3 because somebody not finish it!
And I hate my hat!
I wonder, Signora, as a personal favour if you would oblige us with a private rendition
Unless, of course, M. Reyer objects...
No.
Aspetta, aspetta.
If my managers command...
M. Reyer?
if My diva commands?
Yes, I do
Everybody be quite
Monsieur Lefevre, why exactly are you retiring?
My house I see
You as well
Signora?
Maestro.
Think of me, think of me, fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again
You long to take your heart...
Signora!
He's here:the Phantom of the Opera...
Signora!
Are you all right?
Buquet!
For God's sake, man, what's going on there?
Please, monsieur, don't look at me:
as God's my judge, I was not at my post.
Please, monsieur, there's no one there:
Or if there is, well then, it must be a ghost...
Signora, these things do happen.
For the past years, these things do happen
And did you stop them from happening?
No!
And you too, you are as bad as them, these things do happen
Until you stop these things from happening
This thing does not happen!
Ubaldo!
Andiamo!
Bring my doggy, and my boxy
Amateurs!
Now you see.
Byebye I'm leaving
Gentlemen.
Good luck.
If you need me, I should be in Australia.
Signora Guidicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?
You think so, monsieur?
I have a message, sir, from the Opera Ghost.
God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
He welcomes you to his opera house
His opera house?
And commands that you continue to?
leave Box Five empty for his use and reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Monsieur Lefevre used to give him twenty thousand francs a month.
Twenty thousand francs?
Perhaps you can afford more, with the Vicomte de Chagny as your patron.
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight when the Vicomte was to join us at the gala
But obviously we shall now have to cancel as it appears we have lost our star.
There should be a understudy
Understudy?
There is no understudy for La Calatta
A full house, Andre, we shall have to refund a full house.
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.
The chorus girl?
Don't be silly
She's been taking lessons from a great teacher.
Who?
I don't know his name, monsieur
Let her sing for you, monsieur.
She has been well taught.
Alright, come on, don't be shy, come on, come on
Just, just...
- From the beginning of the aria, mademoiselle
Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
She's very pretty
Think of me, think of me fondly, when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while - please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long to take your heart back and be free if you ever find a moment spare a thought for me...
We never said our love was evergreen,
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember,
Stop and think of me...
Think of all the things
We've shared and seen -
Don't think about the ways things might have been...
Think of me, think of me waking silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard to put you from my mind
Recall those days, look back on all those times
Thinks of the things, we'll never do
There will never be a day when I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seem so long ago,
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me, but I remember her
Flower fade, the fruit of summer fade
They have the season so do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me!
Bravo
Ma musica, splendide
"Gustave Daae"
Bravo, bravo, bravissimi
Christine, Christine
Where in the world have you been hiding
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor
Meg
When your mother brought me here to live
Whenever I come down here alone
To light a candle for my father
A voice from above
And in my dreams
He was always there
You see, when my father lay dying
He told me I will be protected by an angel
An angel of music
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father tutored you?
who... who
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing, I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you are talking in riddles
And it's not like you
Angle of Music
Guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory Who is this angel
This...
Angle of Music
Hide no longer
Secret and strange and joy
He's with me, even now
Your hands are cold
All around you
Your face, Christine, is white
It frightens me
Don't be frightened
No, no
You did very well, my dear
He's pleased with you
Ah, Vicomte, I think we've made quite a discovery with Miss Daae
Perhaps we can present her to you, dear Vicomte
Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind, this is one visitor I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you
It would appear they've met before Yes
Little Lotte let her mind wander
Little Lottie thought:
Am I fonder of dolls or of goblins of shoes Raoul or of riddles of frocks
Those picnics in the attic or of chocolates
Father playing the violin
As we read to each other dark stories of the North
No - what I love best, Lottie said, is when I'm asleep in my bed and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
'
The Angel of Music sings songs in my head!
'
Oh, you're so like an angel tonight
Father said, 'When I'm in heaven, child
I will send the Angel of Music to you'.
Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I have been visited by the Angel of Music.
Oh, no doubt of it
- And now we'll go to supper!
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.
Well, I shan't keep you up late!
Raoul, no
You must change.
I'll order my carriage.
Two minutes
- Little Lottie.
No, Raoul, wait!
Insolent boy!
This slave of fashion basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool!
This brave young suitor, sharing in my triumph!
Angel!
I hear you!
Speak, I listen... stay by my side, guide me!
Angel, my soul was weak - forgive me... enter at last, Master!
Flattering child you shall know me, see why in shadow I hide!
Look at your face in the mirror -
I am there inside!
Angel of Music!
Guide and guardian!
Grant to me your glory!
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me:
Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
I am your Angel of Music Christine, Christine
Come to me:
Angel of Music
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear...
Your/My spirit and your/my voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
I have brought you to the seat of sweet music's throne to this kingdom where all must pay homage to music music
You have come here, for one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing,
I have needed you with me, to serve me, to sing, for my music... my music...
Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation.
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.
Silently the senses abandon their defences
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour.
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender.
Turn your face away from the garish light of day,
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light - and listen to the music of the night...
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams!
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before!
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar!
And you'll live as you've never lived before
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind, in this darkness that you know you cannot fight the darkness of the music of the night.
Let your mind start a journey through a strange, new world!
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before!
Let your soul take you where you long to be!
Only then can you belong to me
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication!
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation!
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
Christine
Like yellow parchment is his skin...
A great black hole served as the nose that never grew...
You must be always on your guard, or he will catch you with his magical lasso!
Those who speak of what they know
Find, too late, that prudent silence is wise.
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I remember there was mist swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around, and on the lake there was a boat, and in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows
Whose is the face in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora!
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah!
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free!
Damn you...
Curse you...
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look or bear to think of me:
this loathsome gargoyle, who burns in bell, but secretly yearns for heaven, secretly...
Christine...
Fear can turn to love - you'll learn to see to find the man behind the monster:
this repulsive carcass, who seems a beast but secretly dreams of beauty, secretly...
Oh, Christine...
Come we must return
Those two fools Who run my theatre Will be missing you.
"Mystery after gala night,"
It says, "Mystery of soprano's flight!"
"Mystified all the papers say, we are mystified - we suspect foul play!"
Bad news on soprano scene -
First Carlotta, now Christine!
Still, at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold...
What a way to run a business!
Spare me these unending trials!
Half your cast disappears, but the crowd still cheers!
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hint!
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!
Andre, please don't shout...
It's publicity!
And the take is vast!
Free publicity!
But we have no cast...
Andre, have you seen the queue?
Oh, it seems you've got one too
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala!
Christine was in the world's sublime!
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left -
On that note the diva is a disaster must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime!
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder:
my salary has not been paid.
Send it care of the ghost, by return of post
P. T. O.:
No-one likes a debtor, so it's better if my orders are obeyed!"
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain!
These are both signed "O. G."...
Who the hell is he?
Opera ghost!
It's nothing short of shocking
He's mucking our position!
In addition he wants money
What a funny aberration to expect a large retainer!
Nothing plainer -he is clearly quite insane!
Where is she?
You mean Carlotta?
I mean Miss Daae -where is she?
Well, how should we know?
I want an answer -
I take it that you sent me this note
What's all this nonsense?
Of course not!
Don't look at us!
She's not with you, then?
Of course not!
We're in the dark...
Monsieur, don't argue -
Isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it, that we're meant to have wrote?
Written!
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again. "
If you didn't write it, who did?
Where is he?
Ah, welcome back!
Your precious patron - where is he?
What is it now?
I have your letter - a letter which I rather resent!
And did you send it?
Of course not!
As if he would!
You didn't send it?
Of course not!
What's going on?
You dare to tell me, that this is not the letter you sent?
!
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune, should you attempt to take her place. "
Far too many notes for my taste - and most of them about Christine!
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name...
Miss Daae has returned
I hope no words for as far as we're concerned
Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best that she was alone...
She needed rest
May I see her?
No, monsieur, she will see no-one.
Will she sing?
Here, I have a note...
Let me see it!
Please!
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature, detailing how my theatre is to be run.
You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance... "
Christine Daae has returned to you, and I am anxious her career should progress.
In the new production of "Il Muto", you will therefore cast Carlotta as the Pageboy, and put Miss Daae in the role of Countess.
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal.
The role of the Pageboy is silent - which makes my casting, in a word, ideal.
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in Box Five, which will be kept empty for me.
Should these commands be ignored, a disaster beyond your imagination will occur.
"I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, O. G."
Christine!
It's all a ploy to help Christine!
Whatever next...?
It's all about a ploy to help Christine
This is insane...
I know who sent this:
The Vicomte - her lover!
Indeed?
Can you believe this?
Signora!
O traditori!
This is a joke!
This changes nothing!
O mentitori!
Signora!
You are our star!
And always will be!
Signora...
The man is mad!
We don't take orders!
Miss Daae will be playing the Pageboy - the silent role...
Carlotta will be playing the lead!
It's useless trying to appease me!
You're only saying this to please me!
Signori, e vero?
Non, non, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!
Who scorn his word, beware to those...
You have reviled me!
The angel sees, the angel knows
You have rebuked me!
Signora, pardon us...?
You have replaced me!
Please, Signora, we beseech you...
This hour shall see your darkest fears...
Signora, sing for us!
Don't be a martyr
What new surprises lie in store?
Our star...!
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?
Miss Daae
Your public needs you!
We need you, too!
Would you not rather have your precious little ingenue?
Signora, no!
The world wants you!
Prima donna first lady of the stage!
Your devotees are on their knees to implore you!
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you!
Prima donna, enchant us once again!
Think of your muse...
And of the queues round the theatre!
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Christine spoke of an angel...
Prima donna, your song shall live again!
- Think of your public!
- You took a snub, but there's a public who needs you!
- She has heard the voice of the angel of music...
- Those who hear your voice liken you to an angel!
Think of their cry of undying support!
We get our opera
She gets her limelight!
Leading ladies are a trial!
Prima donna, your song shall never die!
You'll sing again, and to unending ovation!
- Orders!
Warnings!
Lunatic demands!
- Tears... oaths...
lunatic demands are regular occurrences!
Think how you'll shine in that final encore!
Surely there'll be further scenes worse than this!
Think, before these demands are rejected!
Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve a chorus girl, who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette, entwined in love's duet!
Although he may deny, he must have been with her!
You'd never get away with all this in a play, but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue it's just the sort of story audiences adore, in fact a perfect opera!
Prima donna the world is at your feet!
A nation waits, and how it hates to be cheated!
Light up the stage with that age old rapport!
Sing, prima donna, once more!
Oh, go go
They say that this youth has set my Lady's heart aflame!
His Lordship, sure, would die of shock His Lordship is a laughing-stock!
Should he suspect her, God protect her!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
This faithless lady's bound for HADES!
Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
Serafimo - your disguise is perfect.
Who can this be?
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband.
That's exactly something the public loves
My love
- I am called to England on affairs of State, and must leave you with your new maid.
Though I'd happily take the maid with me.
The old fool is leaving!
That's the Countess de Cherbourg
She's invited us to her salon, you know
Nothing like that will endorse our junk business
Scrap metal
Serafimo - away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence!
Poor fool, he makes me laugh!
Haha, Haha...
Time I tried to get a better better half!
Poor fool, he doesn't know!
Hoho, Hoho...
If he knew the truth, he'd never, ever go!
Did I not instruct that Box Five was to be kept empty?
He's here: the Phantom of the Opera...
It's him
Your part is silent, little toad!
A toad, madame?
Perhaps it is you who are the toad...
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my...
Poor fool, he makes me laugh -
Hahahahaha!
?
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize, the performance will continue in ten minutes' time when the role of the Countess will be played by Miss Daae.
Until then, we will crave your indulgence for a few moments
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.
what?
Maestro, the ballet, bring, please
The ballet
The ballet, now, please
One moment, thank you
Thank you
You're fired
Are you alright?
Raoul, we're not safe here
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It was an accident... simply an accident
Why have you brought us here?
Don't take me back there!
We must return!
He'll kill me!
His eyes will find me there!
Christine, don't say that...
Those eyes that burn!
Don't even think it...
And if he has to kill a thousand men -
Forget this waking nightmare...
The Phantom of the Opera will kill...
This phantom is a fable...
Believe me... ... and kill again!
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
My God, who is this man who hunts to kill...?
...this mask of death...?
I can't escape from him...
Whose is this voice you hear I never will!
...with every breath...?
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind the Phantom of the Opera is here:
inside your/my mind...
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
Raoul, I've been there - to his world of unending night...
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness... darkness...
Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face in that darkness... darkness...
But his voice filled my spirit with a strange, sweet sound...
In that night there was music in my mind...
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard as I'd never heard before...
What you heard was a dream and nothing more...
Yet in his eyes all the sadness of the world...
Those pleading eyes, that both threaten and adore...
Christine...
Christine...
Christine...
No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears.
I'm here, nothing can harm you - my words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom, let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here with you, beside you, to guard you and to guide you...
Say you love me every waking moment, turn my head with talk of summertime...
Say you need me with you now and always...
Promise me that all you say is true that's all I ask of you...
Let me be your shelter, let me be your light.
You're safe:
No one will find you your fears are far behind you...
All I want is freedom, a world with no more night... and you, always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... let me lead you from your solitude...
Say you need me with you here, beside you... anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
Say you love me...
You know I do...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
Anywhere you go let me go too...
Love me - that's all I ask of you...
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Come with me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!
And soon you'll be beside me!
You'll guard me, and you'll guide me...
I gave you my music... made your song take wing... and now how you've repaid me:
denied me and betrayed me...
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing...
Christine...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime... say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You will curse the day you did not do all that the Phantom asked of you...!
"Bal Masque"
M'sieur Andre?
M'sieur Firmin?
Dear Andre, what a splendid party!
The prologue to a bright new year!
Quite a night!
I'm impressed!
Well, one does one's best...
Here's to us!
The toast for the city
What a pity that 'Phantom' can't be here.
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade..
Masquerade!
Look around - there's another mask behind you!
Flash of mauve..
Splash of puce...
Fool and king...
Ghoul and goose...
Green and black...
Queen and priest...
Trace and rouge...
Face of beast...
Faces...
Take your turn, take a ride on the merry-go-round... in an inhuman race...
Eye of gold...
Thigh of blue...
True is false...
Who is who...?
Crul of lip...
Swirl of gown...
Ace of hearts...
Face of clown...
Faces...
Drink it in, drink it up, till you've drowned in the light... in the sound...
But who can name the face...
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Seething shadows, breathing lies...
Masquerade!
You can fool any friend who ever knew you!
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes...
Masquerade!
Run and hide - but a face will still pursue you!
What a night!
What a crowd!
Makes you glad!
Makes you proud!
All the creme de la creme!
Watching us watching them!
And all our fears are in the past!
Six months...
Of relief!
Of delight!
Of Elysian peace!
And we can breathe at last!
No more notes!
No more ghosts!
Here's a health!
Here's a toast: to a prosperous year!
To the new chandelier!
to the hear
And may its splendour never fade!
Six months!
What a joy!
What a change!
What a blessed release!
And what a masquerade!
Think of it!
A secret engagement!
Look - your future bride!
Just think of it!
But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me
No, Raoul, please don't do this
Well, let them see
It's an engagement, not a crime!
Christine, What are you afraid of?
Let's not argue...
Let's not argue...
Please pretend...
I can only hope I'll...
You will understand in time...
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade!
Masquerade!
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade!
Masquerade!
Look around -
There's another mask behind you!
Masquerade!
Burning glances turning heads...
Masquerade!
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...
Masquerade!
Take your fill - let the spectacle astound you!
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera!
Here I bring the finished score
"Don Juan Triumphant"!
Fondest greetings to you all!
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts:
Carlotta must be taught to act, not her normal trick of strutting round the stage.
Our Don Juan must lose some weight - it's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age.
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office, not the arts.
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...
No doubt she'll do her best - it's true her voice is good.
She knows, though, should she wish to excel she has much still to learn, if pride will let her return to me
Her teacher, her teacher...
Your chains are still mine
You belong to me
Madame Giry.
Madame Giry...
Please, Monsieur, I know no more than anyone else.
That's not true.
Monsieur, don't ask, there have been too many accidents
Accidents?
Please, Madame Giry, for all our sakes...
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a travelling fair in the city.
Gypsies
I was very young, studying to be a ballerina
One of many
Living in the dormitory of the opera house
Come, come, come inside
Come and see the devil's child
?
the devil's child
Devil's child
Murder, murder
Which way?
...way
I have hidden him from the world and its cruelty is
He has known nothing else of life since then
Except this opera house
It was his playground and now his artistic domain
He's a genius, he's an architect and designer
He's a composer and a magician
A genius, monsieur
But clearly, Madame Giry, genius has turned to madness
Monsieur
Ou vas tu, mademoiselle?
The cemetery
To my father's grave, please
Where have they gone?
Oh, the cemetery
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing
Her Father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.
Her father promised her...
Her father promised her
You were once my one companion... you were all that mattered...
You were once a friend and father - then my world was shattered...
Wishing you were somehow here again... wishing you were somehow near...
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed, somehow you would be here...
Wishing I could hear your voice again... knowing that I never would...
Dreaming of you won't help me to do, all that you dreamed I could!
Passing bells and sculpted angels, cold and monumental.
Seem, for you, the wrong companions, you were warm and gentle.
Too many years fighting back tears, why can't the past just die!
Wishing you were somehow here again, knowing we must say goodbye!
Try to forgive, teach me to live!
Give me the strength to try!
No more memories, no more silent tears!
No more gazing across the wasted years!
Help me say goodbye... help me say goodbye!
Wandering child,
So lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father?
Friend or phantom?
Who is it there, staring?
Have you forgotten your Angel?
Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze
Wildly my mind beats against you
You resist
Yet your/the soul obeys...
Angel of Music!
You denied me/I denied you
Turning from true beauty
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protector
Come to me/your strange Angel...
I am your Angel of Music...
Come to me;
Angel of Music No, Christine, wait!
Wait!
Raoul!
Whatever you believe, this man - this thing - is not your father!
No, Raoul, no
Not like this
Now, let it be war upon you both!
We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance
To ensnare our clever friend
We're listening...
Go on.
We shall play his game
Perform his work, but remember we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend
We are certain the doors are barred
We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls
His reign will end!
Raoul, I'm frightened...
Don't make me do this
Raoul, it scares me,
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me, I know
We'll be parted forever...
He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream, I now dread.
If he finds me, it won't ever end.
And he'll always be there, singing songs in my head...
He'll always be there, singing songs in my head...
You said yourself,
He was nothing but a man...
Yet while he lives,
He will haunt us 'til we're dead.
Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse...
And yet, I wish I could
Oh God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me
In this, the Phantom's opera
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
But every hope, and every prayer rests on you now
Seal my fate tonight
I hate to have to cut the fun short
But the joke's wearing thin
Let the audience in
Let my opera begin!
"Don Juan"
Here the sire may serve the dam, here the master takes his meat!
Here the sacrificial lamb utters one despairing bleat!
Poor young maiden!
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets you will have to pay the bill - tangled in the winding sheets!
Serve the meal and serve the maid!
Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that, when tables, plans and maids are laid,
Don Juan triumphs once again!
Passarino, faithful friend, once again recite the plan.
Your young guest believes I'm you -
I, the master, you, the man
When you met you wore my cloak, she cannot see your face.
She believes she dines with me, in her master's borrowed place!
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff, stealing what, in truth, is mine.
When it's late and modesty starts to mellow, with the wine...
You come home!
I use your voice - slam the door like crack of doom!
I shall say: "come - hide with me!
Where, oh, where?
Of course - my room!"
Poor thing hasn't got a chance!
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword.
Conquest is assured, if I do not forget myself and laugh...
No thoughts within her head, but thoughts of joy!
No dreams within her heart but dreams of love!
Master?
Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for its prey...
You have come here in pursuit of your deepest urge, in pursuit of that wish, which till now has been silent, silent...
I have brought you, that our passions may fuse and merge - in your mind you've already succumbed to me dropped all defences completely succumbed to me - now you are here with me:
no second thoughts, you've decided,
decided...
Past the point of no return - no backward glances:
Our games of make-believe are at an end
Past all thought of "if" or "when" - no use resisting:
abandon thought, and let the dream descend...
What raging fire shall flood the soul
What rich desire unlocks its door
What sweet seduction lies before us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets
Will we learn beyond the point of no return?
You have brought me
To that moment when words run dry
To that moment when speech disappears
Into silence
Silence.
I have come here,
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent,
Now I am here with you
No second thoughts
I've decided
Decided.
Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion-play has now at last begun.
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait before we're one?
When will the blood begin to race
The sleeping bud burst into bloom
When will the flames at last consume us?
Past the point of no return
The final threshold
The bridge is crossed
So stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return.
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you'll want me
With you here
Beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go too
Christine that's all I ask of...
Go!
Oh,?
You left before me
Oh my God
We'll run, Andre, run
Where did he take her?
Come with me, monsieur
I will take you to him
But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes
I'll go with you
No, Meg, you must stay here
Come with me, monsieur
No!
Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind
Down that path into darkness, deep as hell
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin but the wickedness of my abhorrent face
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Track down this murderer
He must be found
Hounded out by everyone
Met with hatred everywhere
No kind words from anyone
No compassion anywhere
Christine
Why, why...?
Your hand at the level of your eyes
This is as far as I dare go
Thank you
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
That fate, which condemns me to wallow in blood
Has also denied me the joys of the flesh...
This face, the infection which poisons our love...
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing
A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing
Pity comes too late
Turn around and face your fate
An eternity of this before your eyes
This haunted face holds no horror for me now
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies
Wait!
I think, my dear, we have a guest
Sir!
- Raoul!
This is indeed an unparalleled delight
I had rather hoped that you would come
And now my wish comes true
You have truly made my night!
Let me go!
Free her
Do what you like, only free her
Have you no pity?
Your lover makes a passionate plea
Please, Raoul, it's useless
I love her
Does that mean nothing?
I love her
Show some compassion
The world showed no compassion to me!
Christine...
Let me see her
Be my guest, sir...
Monsieur, I bid you welcome
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay for the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes
Nothing can save you now, except perhaps Christine
Start a new life with me
Buy his freedom with your love!
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice,
This is the point of no return!
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate,
Grow cold and turn to tears of hate
Christine, forgive me, please forgive me
I did it all for you, and all for nothing...
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered Too late for turning back, Too late for prayers and useless pity
Say you love him, and my life is over!
All hope of cries for help, No point in fighting
For either way you choose, You cannot win Either way you choose, he has to win
So do you end your days with me
Or do you send him to his grave?
Why make her lie to you to save me?
Angel of Music...
Past the point of no return...
Christine say no!
Who deserved this?
Don't throw your life away for my sake!
The final threshold...
His life is now the prize which you must earn!
Why do you curse mercy?
I fought so hard to free you...
Angel of Music... you deceived me You've passed the point of no return!
I gave you my mind blindly
You try my patience,
Make your choice!
Pitiful creature of darkness,
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you,
You are not alone...
Track down this murderer, he must be found!
Take her, forget me,
Forget all of this...
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground!
Leave me alone - forget all you've seen...
Go now - don't let them find you!
Take the boat, swear to me, never to tell
The secret you know, of the angel in hell!
Go now - go now and leave me!
Masquerade
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade
Hide your face so the world will never find you...
Christine, I love you...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...
You alone, can make my song take flight
It's over now, the music of the night
"Countess de Chagny Beloved wife and mother"
"Chrisine 1854-1917"

Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness
Who will be there for you
Comfort and care for you
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion
Never dreamed out in the world
There are arms to hold you?
You've always known
Your heart was on its own
So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone
Learn to be lonely
Life can be lived
Life can be loved
Alone.

A chandelier in pieces.
Some of you may recall the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera.
A mystery never fully explained.
We're told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the very chandelier ... which figures in the famous disaster.
Our workshops have repaired it and wired parts of it for the new electric light.
Perhaps we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago ... with a little illumination.
Gentlemen?
The trophy From our saviors
From our saviors
From the enslaving force
Of Rome!
Madame.
With feasting and dancing and song
Tonight in celebration We greet the victorious throng
Returned to bring salvation!
I've got them, monsieur.
Vicomte, welcome.
The trumpets of Carthage resound
Hear, Romans, now and tremble
Hark to our step on the ground
Hear the drums Hannibal comes!
You make my dress train too long.
Sad to return To find the land we love
Threatened once more By Roma's far-reaching grasp
Gentlemen, gentlemen --
Rehearsals are under way for a new production of Chalumeau's Hannibal.
- Monsieur Lefevre, I am rehearsing.
- Monsieur Reyer, Madame Giry ... ladies and gentlemen, please, if I could have your attention?
As you know, there have been rumors of my imminent retirement.
I can now tell you that these were all true, and it is my pleasure to introduce you ... to the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire ...
Monsieur Richard Firmin and Monsieur Gilles Andre.
I'm sure you have read of their recent fortune in the junk business.
Scrap metal, actually.
They must be rich.
And we are deeply honored to introduce our new patron.
The Vicomte de Chagny.
I still can't believe we managed to get him.
It's such a coup for us, my dear.
It's Raoul.
Before my father died, at the house by the sea ...
I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts.
- He called me Little Lotte.
- Christine, he's so handsome.
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts ... especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire.
Gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli, our leading soprano for five seasons.
- Brava!
Brava!
- Brava!
Brava!
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.
An honor, signor.
I believe I'm keeping you from your rehearsal.
I will be here this evening to share your great triumph.
My apologies.
Thank you, monsieur.
- Once more if you please, signor.
- He love me.
He love me.
Thank you, indeed, for the wonderful words.
So inspiring and encouraging ...
He wouldn't recognize me.
- He didn't see you.
- If you please.
Monsieur.
We take particular pride in the excellence of our ballet.
I see why.
Especially that little blond angel.
My daughter, Meg Giry.
And that exceptional beauty.
No relation, I trust?
Christine Daae.
Promising talent, Monsieur Firmin.
Very promising.
Daae, did you say?
No relation to the famous Swedish violinist?
His only child.
Orphaned at 7 when she came to live and train in the ballet dormitories.
An orphan, you say?
I think of her as a daughter also.
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side.
Hannibal's friends!
Ah, me!
Not on my dress!
Why?
The trumpeting elephants sound
Hear, Romans, now and tremble
Hark to their step on the ground
Hear the drums!
Hannibal comes!
All day!
All they want is the dancing!
Well, the Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala.
I hope he is as excited by dancing girls as your new managers ... because I will not be singing!
Get my doggy, bring my doggy.
Bye-bye.
- What do we do?
- Grovel.
- Grovel, grovel.
- Right.
- I'm going now.
It is finished.
- World-renowned artist and great beauty.
Bella diva.
Goddess of song.
Monsieur Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elissa ... in Act 3 of Hannibal?
Perhaps the signora --
Because I have not my costume for Act 3.
Because somebody not finish it!
And I hate my hat!
Signora, as a personal favor, would you oblige us with a private rendition?
Unless, of course, Monsieur Reyer objects.
If my managers command.
- Monsieur Reyer?
- If my diva commands.
Yes, I do.
Everybody, very quiet.
- Monsieur, why exactly are you retiring?
- My health.
- I see.
- You as well!
Signora.
Maestro.
Think of me Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again You long to take your heart back
And be free --
- Oh, my God, signora!
- I hate you.
- Lift it up!
- He's here.
The Phantom of the Opera.
Signora, are you all right?
Buquet!
For God's sake, what's going on up there?
Please, monsieur, don't look at me.
As God's my judge, I wasn't at my post.
Please, monsieur, there's no one there.
Or if there is, well, then, it must be a ghost.
Signora, these things do happen.
For the past three years these things do happen.
And did you stop them from happening?
No!
And you two, you are as bad as him.
"These things do happen."
Until you stop these things from happening, this thing does not happen!
- Bring my doggy and my boxy.
- Amateurs.
Now you see.
Bye-bye, I'm really leaving.
Gentlemen, good luck.
If you need me, I shall be in Australia.
Signora Giudicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?
You think so, monsieur?
- I have a message from the Opera Ghost.
- Oh, God in heaven, you're all obsessed!
- He welcomes you to his opera house.
- His opera house?
And commands that you continue to leave box five empty ... for his use.
And reminds you that his salary is due.
His salary?
Well, Monsieur Lefevre used to give him 20,000 francs a month.
Twenty thousand francs?
Perhaps you can afford more.
With the vicomte as your patron?
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight ... when the vicomte was to join us for the gala.
Obviously, we shall now have to cancel, as it appears we have lost our star!
- But surely there must be an understudy.
- There is no understudy for La Carlotta!
A full house, Andre.
We shall have to refund a full house!
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.
What, a chorus girl?
Don't be silly.
She has been taking lessons from a great teacher.
- Who?
- I don't know his name, monsieur.
Let her sing for you, monsieur.
She has been well taught.
All right.
Come on, don't be shy.
Come on, come along.
Just ...
From the beginning of the aria then, please, mademoiselle.
- Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.
- She's very pretty.
Think of me Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while
Please promise me you'll try
When you find That once again you long
To take your heart back And be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me
We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me
Think of all the things We've shared and seen
Don't think about the way
Things might have been
Think of me, think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard
To put you from my mind
Recall those days Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you
Can it be?
Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago It seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me
But I remember her
Flowers fade The fruits of summer fade
They have their seasons So do we
But please promise me That sometimes
You will think
Of me
Brava!
Brava, brava, bravissima
Christine, Christine
Christine
Where in the world Have you been hiding?
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor?
Meg ... when your mother brought me here to live ... whenever I'd come down here alone ... to light a candle for my father ... a voice, from above ... and in my dreams, he was always there.
You see ... when my father lay dying ... he told me I would be protected by an angel.
An angel of music.
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father's coaching you?
Who else, Meg?
Who?
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room He calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know He's always with me
He, the unseen genius
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this Can't Come true
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you
Angel of Music Guide and guardian
- Grant to me your glory
- Who is this angel?
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer
- This Angel of Music, hide no longer
- Secret and strange angel
- Secret and strange angel
He's with me even now
- Your hands are cold
- All around me
Your face, Christine, it's white
- It frightens me
- Don't be frightened
No.
You did very well, my dear.
He is pleased with you.
- Vicomte.
- Vicomte.
We've made quite a discovery with Miss Daae.
Perhaps we could present her to you, dear vicomte?
If you wouldn't mind, this is one visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied.
Thank you.
It would appear they've met before.
Little Lotte let her mind wander.
Little Lotte thought, "Am I fonder of dolls or of goblins or shoes?"
- Raoul.
- "Or of riddles or frocks?"
- Those picnics in the attic.
- "Or of chocolates?"
- Father playing the violin.
- As we read to each other ... dark stories of the North.
- No.
"What I love best," Lotte said, "is when I'm asleep in my bed."
And the Angel of Music Sings songs in my head
The Angel of Music Sings songs in my head
You sang like an angel tonight.
Father said:
"When I'm in heaven, child, I will send the Angel of Music to you."
Well, father is dead, Raoul.
And I have been visited by the Angel of Music.
No doubt of it.
And now we go to supper.
No, Raoul.
- The Angel of Music is very strict.
- Well, I shan't keep you up late.
Raoul, no.
You must change.
I'll order my carriage, Little Lotte.
No.
Raoul, wait!
Insolent boy, this slave of fashion
Basking in your glory
Ignorant fool, this brave young suitor
Sharing in my triumph
Angel, I hear you Speak, I listen
Stay by my side Guide me
Angel, my soul was weak Forgive me
Enter at last, master
Flattering child, you shall know me
See why in shadow I hide
Look at your face in the mirror
I am there inside!
Angel of Music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory
Angel of Music, hide no longer
Come to me, strange angel
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music
Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?
- I am your Angel of Music
- Christine.
Christine!
Come to me, Angel of Music
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
- Your spirit and my voice
- My spirit and your voice
- In one combined
- In one combined
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, my Angel of Music.
Sing, my angel.
Sing for me!
Sing, my angel.
Sing for me!
I have brought you
To the seat of sweet music's throne
To this kingdom where all must Pay homage to music
Music, you have come here
For one purpose, and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing
I have needed you with me To serve me, to sing
For my music
My music
Night-time sharpens
Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs
And wakes imagination
Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses
Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away
From cold, unfeeling light
And listen to The music of the night
Close your eyes and surrender To your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life You knew before
Close your eyes
Let your spirit start
To soar
And you'll live As you've never lived before
Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know
You cannot fight
The darkness of The music of the night
Let your mind start a journey Through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life You knew before
Let your soul take you
Where you long to be
Only then can you belong
To me
Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of The music of the night
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make
The music of the
Night
Christine?
Like yellow parchment is his skin
A great black hole serves As the nose that never grew
You must be always on your guard
Or he will catch you with his magical lasso
Oh, my.
Those who speak of what they know
Find too late that prudent silence is wise
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes.
I remember there was mist
Swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were Candles all around
And on the lake there was a boat
And in the boat there was a man
Who was that shape in the shadows?
Whose is the face in the mask?
Damn you!
You little prying Pandora
You little demon!
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah
You little viper Now you cannot ever be free
Damn you!
Curse you!
Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look
Or bear to think of me?
This loathsome gargoyle Who burns in hell
But secretly yearns for heaven
Secretly, secretly
Christine
Fear can turn to love
You'll learn to see To find the man
Behind the monster, this
Repulsive carcass Who seems a beast
But secretly dreams of beauty
Secretly, secretly
Oh, Christine
Come, we must return.
Those two fools who run my theater will be missing you.
"Mystery after gala night"
It says "Mystery of soprano's flight"
"Mystified" All the papers say
"We are mystified We suspect foul play"
Bad news on soprano scene First Carlotta, now Christine
Still at least the seats get sold
Gossip's worth its weight in gold
What a way to run a business
Spare me these unending trials
Half your cast disappears But the crowd still cheers
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel Have a scandal
- And you're sure to have a hit
- Damnable, will they all walk out?
- This is damnable
- Andre, please don't shout
It's publicity, and the take is vast Free publicity
But we have no cast
Andre, have you seen the queue?
It seems you've got one too
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala Christine was, in a word, sublime
We were hardly bereft When Carlotta left
On that note, the diva's a disaster
Must you cast her When she's seasons past her prime?"
"Dear Firmin, just a brief reminder
My salary has not been paid
Send it Care of the Ghost By return of post PTO
No one likes a debtor So it's better if my orders are obeyed"
Who would have the gall to send this?
- Someone with a puerile brain
- These are both signed O.G.
- Who the hell is he?
- Opera Ghost
- It's nothing short of shocking
- He is mocking our position
- In addition he wants money
- What a funny apparition
To expect a large retainer He is clearly quite insane
- Where is she?
- Carlotta?
I mean, Miss Daae Where is she?
- How do we know?
- I want an answer
- You sent me this note
- What's this nonsense?
- Of Course not
- Don't look at us
- She's not with you?
- Of Course not
- We're in the dark
- Don't argue, isn't this the letter you wrote?
And what is it that We're meant to have wrote?
Written.
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again."
- If you didn't write it, who did?
- Where is he?
- Welcome back
- Your precious patron, where is he?
- What is it?
- I have your letter
- A letter I rather resent
- Did you send it?
- Of Course not
- As if he would
- You didn't send it?
- Of Course not
- What's going on?
- Tell me, this is not the letter you sent?
And what is it That I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune ... should you attempt to take her place."
Far too many notes for my taste
And most of them about Christine
AII we've heard since we came Is Miss Daae's name
- Miss Daae has returned
- I hope no worse for wear
- As far as we're concerned
- Where precisely is she now?
I thought it best she was alone
She needed rest
- May I see her?
- No, monsieur, she will see no one
Will she sing?
Will she sing?
- Here, I have a note
- Let me see it
Please.
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature ... detailing how my theater is to be run.
You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance.
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious Her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore Cast Carlotta
As the pageboy
And put Miss Daae In the role of countess
The role which Miss Daae plays
Calls for charm and appeal
The role of the pageboy is silent
Which makes my casting In a word, ideal
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five ... which will be kept empty for me.
Should these commands be ignored ... a disaster beyond your imagination will occur.
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant.
O.G."
- Christine
- Whatever next?
- It's all a ploy to help Christine
- This is insane
I know who sent this The vicomte, her lover
- Indeed!
Can you believe this?
- Signora
- Signora
- You are our star
- And always will be
- Signora
- The man is mad
- We don't take orders
Miss Daae will be playing the pageboy, the silent role.
Carlotta will be playing the lead
- It's useless trying to appease me
- Appease her
- You're only saying this to please me
- To please her
- Who scorn his word, beware to those
- You have reviled me
- The angel sees, the angel knows
- You have rebuked me
- Signora, pardon us
- You have replaced me
Please, signora, we beseech you
- I must see her
- This hour shall see your darkest fears
- The angel knows, the angel hears
- Where did she go?
Signora, sing for us Don't be a martyr
- What new surprises lie in store?
- Our star!
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?
Miss Daae?
Your public needs you.
We need you too.
Would you not rather have Your precious little ingénue?
- Signora, no.
- Signora, no.
The world wants you
Prima donna First lady of the stage
Your devotees Are on their knees
To implore you
Can you bow out when They're shouting your name?
Think of how they all adore you
Prima donna Enchant us once again
- Think of your muse
- And of the queues round the theater
Can you deny us The triumph in store?
Sing, prima donna Once more
- Christine spoke of an angel
- Prima donna
Your song shall live again
- Think of your public
- You took a snub
- But there's a public who needs you
- She has heard the voice
- Of the Angel of Music
- Those who hear your voice
- Liken you to an angel
- Think of their cry of undying support
- We get our opera
- She gets her limelight
- Follow where the limelight leads you
- Leading ladies are a trial
Prima donna Your song shall never die
- You'll sing again and to unending ovation
- Orders, warnings
- Lunatic demands
- Lunatic demands are regular occurrences
Think how you'll shine In that final encore
Surely there'll be further scenes Worse than this
I must see these demands are rejected
Who'd believe a diva happy To relieve a chorus girl
Who's gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette Entwined in love's duet
Although he may demur He must have been with her
You'd never get away With all this in a play
But if it's loudly sung And in a foreign tongue
It's just the sort of story Audiences adore
- In fact, a perfect opera
- For if his curse is on the opera
Prima donna, the world is at your feet
A nation waits And how it hates to be cheated
Light up the stage
With that age-old rapport
Sing, prima donna
Once more
Go on, go, go.
They say that this youth Has set my lady's heart aflame
His Lordship, sure Would die of shock
His Lordship is a laughingstock
Should he suspect her, God protect her Shame, shame, shame
This faithless lady's Bound for Hades
Shame, shame, shame
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect
Why, who can this be?
Gentle wife Admit your loving husband
That's exactly the sort of thing the public loves.
My love, I'm called to England On affairs of state
And must leave you With your new maid
Though I would happily take the maid with me.
The old fool is leaving.
It's the Countess de Charbourg.
She's invited us to her salon, you know.
Nothing like that ever happened in the junk business.
Scrap metal.
Serafimo, away with this pretense
You cannot speak But kiss me in my husband's absence
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
Time I tried to get a better Better half
Poor fool, he doesn't know
If he knew the truth He'd never ever go
Did I not instruct that box five was to be kept empty?
He's here, the Phantom of the Opera.
- It's him.
- Your part is silent, little toad.
A toad, Madame?
Perhaps it is you who are the toad.
Why you spray on my chin all the time, huh?
Serafimo, away with this pretense
You cannot speak But kiss me in my --
Gentlemen, please, please.
Poor fool, he makes me laugh
She's lost her voice.
Mother!
Bring the curtain in, please, will you?
Get off.
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize.
The performance will continue in 10 minutes' time ... when the role of the countess will be played by Miss Daae.
Thank you.
Go, go, hurry up.
Hurry up.
Until then, we would crave your indulgence for a few moments.
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act 3 of tonight's opera.
- What?
- Maestro ... the ballet, bring it forward, please.
- The ballet.
- The ballet, now, please.
Thank you.
You're fired.
- Are you all right?
- Raoul, we're not safe here.
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It's simply an accident.
An accident.
Why have you brought me here?
- We can't go back there
- We must return
He'll kill you His eyes will find us there
- Christine, don't say that
- Those eyes that burn
- Don't even think it
- If he has to kill a thousand men
- Forget this waking nightmare
- The Phantom of the Opera will kill
Believe me There is no Phantom of the Opera
My God, who is this man Who hunts to kill?
- This mask of death
- I can't escape from him
- Whose is this voice you hear
- I never will
- With every breath?
- And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
- The Phantom of the Opera is here
- The Phantom of the Opera is there
- Inside my mind
- Inside your mind
There is no Phantom of the Opera
Raoul, I've been there
To his world of unending night
To a world where the daylight Dissolves into darkness
Darkness
Raoul, I've seen him
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed It was hardly a face
In that darkness
Darkness
But his voice filled my spirit With a strange, sweet sound
In that night There was music in my mind
And through music My soul began
To soar
And I heard
- As I'd never heard before
- What you heard was a dream
And nothing more
Yet in his eyes
All the sadness of the world
Those pleading eyes
That both threaten
And adore
Christine
Christine ...
No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here Nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you
Say you love me
Every waking moment
Turn my head
With talk of summertime
Say you need me with you
Now and always
Promise me
That all you say is true
- That's all I ask of you
- Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe No one will find you
Your fears are far behind you
All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you always beside me
To hold me and to hide me
Then say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Let me lead you
From your solitude
Say you need me With you
Here beside you
Anywhere you go Let me go too
Christine
That's all I ask of you
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word And I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
- Say you love me
- You know I do
Love me
That's all I ask of you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
Love me
That's all I ask of you
I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Come with me, Raoul
Christine, I love you
Order your fine horses
Be with them at the door
And soon you'll be beside me
You'll guard me and you'll guide me
I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now How you've repaid me
Denied me And betrayed me
He was bound to love you
When he heard you sing
Christine
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Say the word And I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
You will curse the day
You did not do
All that the Phantom
Asked of you
Monsieur Andre.
Monsieur Firmin.
Dear Andre, what a splendid party
The prologue to a bright new year
- Quite a night, I'm impressed
- Well, one does one's best
- Here's to us
- The toast of all the city
What a pity that The Phantom Can't be here
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face So the world will never find you
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade
Masquerade
Look around There's another mask behind you
Flash of mauve, splash of puce Fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest Trace of rouge, face of beast
- Faces!
Take your turn
- Take a ride
- On the merry-go-round
- In an inhuman race
Eye of gold, thigh of blue True is false, who is who?
Curl of lip, swirl of gown Ace of hearts, face of clown
Faces!
Drink it in, drink it up
Till you've drowned In the light, in the sound
But who can name the face?
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds Masquerade
Take your fill Let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade
Stop and stare At the sea of smiles around you
Masquerade
Seething shadows, breathing lies
Masquerade
You can fool any friend Who ever knew you
Masquerade!
Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade
Run and hide But a face will still pursue you
- What a night
- What a crowd
- Makes you glad
- Makes you proud
- All the crème de la crème
- Watching us watching them
- Three months of relief
- Of delight
- Of Elysian peace
- And we can breathe at last
- No more notes
- No more ghost
- Here's to health
- Here's a toast to a prosperous year
- To our friends who are here
- And may our splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade
Think of it
A secret engagement.
Look, your future bride.
- Just think of it.
- But why is it secret?
What have we to hide?
You promised me.
- No, Raoul.
Please don't.
They'll see.
- Let them see.
It's an engagement, not a crime.
Christine, what are you afraid of?
- Let's not argue
- Let's not argue
- Please pretend
- I can only hope
- You will understand in time
- I'll understand in time
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade
Masquerade
Hide your face So the world will never find you
Masquerade!
Every face a different shade Masquerade
Look around There's another mask behind you
Masquerade!
Burning glances, turning heads Masquerade
Stop and stare At the sea of smiles around you
Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds Masquerade
Take your fill Let the spectacle astound you
Why so silent, good messieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good messieurs?
I have written you an opera
Here, I bring the finished score
Don Juan Triumphant
Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions Just before rehearsal starts
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick Of strutting round the stage
Our Don Juan must lose some weight
It's not healthy
In a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn
That their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for our star
Miss Christine Daae
No doubt she'll do her best
It's true her voice is good
She knows, though Should she wish to excel
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her Return to me
Her teacher
Your chains are still mine!
You belong to me!
- Madame Giry --
- Please, I know no more than anyone else.
- That's not true!
- Monsieur, don't ask.
- There have been too many accidents.
- Accidents?
Please, Madame Giry ... for all our sakes.
Very well.
It was years ago.
There was a traveling fair in the city.
Gypsies.
I was very young.
Studying to be a ballerina.
One of many.
Living in the dormitories of the opera house.
See the wonder from the East!
Come.
Come inside.
Come and see the Devil's Child.
Behold, mesdames and messieurs, the Devil's Child!
Devil's Child.
Murder!
- Murder!
- Which way?
!
That way!
That way!
He's getting away!
I hid him from the world and its cruelties.
He has known nothing else of life since then ... except this opera house.
It was his playground ... and now his artistic domain.
He's a genius.
He's an architect and designer.
He's a composer and a magician.
- A genius, monsieur.
- But clearly, Madame Giry ... genius has turned to madness.
- Monsieur.
- Where to?
The cemetery.
To my father's grave, please.
- Where have they gone?
- The cemetery.
In sleep, he sang to me ln dreams, he came
That voice, which calls to me
And speaks my name
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing.
Her father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.
Her father promised her.
You were once My one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once A friend and father
Then my world was shattered
Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed If I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here
Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could
Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle
Too many years Fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die?
Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive Teach me to live
Give me the strength to try
No more memories No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye
Help me say
Goodbye
Wandering child So lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance
Angel or father Friend or phantom?
- Who is it there staring?
- Have you forgotten your angel?
Angel, oh, speak What endless longings
Echo in this whisper
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze
- Wildly, my mind beats against you
- You resist
- Yet your soul obeys
- Yet the soul obeys
- Angel of Music, you denied me
- Angel of Music, I denied you
- Turning from true beauty
- Turning from true beauty
- Angel of Music, do not shun me
- Angel of Music, my protector
