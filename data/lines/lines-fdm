Hello?
I don't understand why you're doing this.
You tricked me into coming to Chuck's hotel by saying he was in jeopardy and won't let me leave.
What am I to do?
Jump out a third story window?
Come on.
I know where Blair is.
Smart girl.
You and Chuck might not be together, but from what I can tell you're still the thing he loves most in the world.
You're not going anywhere tonight.
Bonsoir, Upper East Siders?
Are you enjoying the party as much as I am?
I know one person who isn't.
And this is our beautiful Milo.
He's ten months old, the little guy.
OMG, so cute!
Is he sleeping through the night?
From eight till six.
I get up with him so Georgina can sleep in.
Your life sounds perfect.
- It is.
- So how did you two meet?
- Well, that's a real romantic story.
- He wanted a hot wife to impress his partners and I wanted a loft and a legacy at Yale for Milo.
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to get drunk enough to make you all seem interesting.
Dan.
- Oh, of course you'd be here.
- I can tell you're up to something.
Let me in on it.
I haven't been this bored since I believed in Jesus.
If I was up to something, and I'm not the last thing I would want is Georgina Sparks getting involved.
Not unless the thing was twisted.
In which case, my help could prove invaluable.
And you've drowned in the teasing
How's the party?
I promise, Mom, you're not missing anything.
Unless you think Amy Chua trying to convince Queller to grade her kids more harshly is exciting.
Check your e-mail.
Thank you.
You're a good son.
- Is that Eric at the party?
- Yeah.
Hey, Eric.
Have Serena and Vanessa found Charlie yet?
- I don't know.
Why?
- Oh, well, she's gone off of her...
Don't embarrass her.
She'll be fine.
Look, if you see Serena, have her give me a call and check in, okay?
Yeah.
I'll find her right now.
Oh, Mrs. Harrington.
Mr. Harrington, I'm so sorry.
Charlie, come on.
Put down the bottle.
What are you doing?
Why are you even here?
Oh.
Obviously, it's a mistake if you're anywhere near me.
Now listen, maybe...
I think I overreacted before.
I mean, what you said, it took me by surprise.
But I get it.
You just want me to like you.
Well, I already do.
What do you say about a do-over?
We could go somewhere and talk.
Come on.
Yeah.
Why did you lead me on for weeks?
Why didn't you just tell me you didn't like me?
Is that something you learned from Serena?
Because...
- Excuse me, sir.
- Oh.
Oh, oh.
Tell me when we're leaving The great unknown
All right.
We need a plan B.
Show me the way To go
- Serena.
- Headmistress Queller.
Have you met our distinguished alum, Cecily?
We've never met, but I've read about you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye.
So how is Providence?
- I'm at Columbia actually.
- Oh.
What happened to Brown?
I deferred for a year, and then when it was time to go back my dad helped get me into Columbia, to be close to my friends and family.
Oh.
I know I was always hard on you, Serena but it was only because I thought you could become something.
I hoped you'd leave New York, see the world maybe find your place somewhere far away from all this.
Oh, well.
Maybe after college.
- What's wrong with you?
- Excuse me?
Don't tell me you're gonna lecture me about my choice of college too.
College?
No.
But how could you not end up with Nate or Dan?
We both voted on Gossip Girl's poll and we both lost.
- So who did you end up with?
The billionaire or the guy who tried to kill you?
Neither actually.
I wanted to be like you, but now I wanna be Blair.
At least she's going to be a princess.
Okay, shoo.
I'm perfectly happy with my life, but thank you for your concern.
Oh.
Spoke too soon.
I'd ask how you are, but I don't really care.
Well, I'll take that as an opportunity to answer anyway.
I mean, I'd say I'm great.
Look at my hair, my clothes, my body but I've actually become a Bedford wife and it's really just the worse thing.
Please let me in on whatever scheme everyone seems to be a part of.
I haven't conspired since I convinced Dan he was Milo's dad.
Unless you count speeding up the process at a hospice to get someone's apartment.
- Anyway, I'm sure I can be useful.
- Not to me.
I had Charlie, but she slipped away.
She's got to be around here somewhere.
I'm sorry.
She's a part of the gang, but I'm not?
- Mine's from Charlie.
- Mine too.
"I'm sorry.
Goodbye"?
Who's this amateur?
- Serena's cousin.
She's in trouble.
- We have to come up with a new plan.
Oh!
The Badger?
The Melon Drop?
The Spanish Prisoner?
Divide and conquer.
She could be anywhere.
Yeah.
I'll go to my dad's in case she goes home.
- I'll go to the loft.
- I'll stay here, in case she comes back.
Okay.
What do I do?
You can just go away.
I don't understand.
If you're not going to torture me or whatever why don't you just let me leave?
And why do you keep doing that?
Because it's taking longer than I thought.
What is?
She said she was on the third floor.
Do you smell something weird like...?
Gas.
I'm calling 911.
I turned it on before you got here.
But this place is big and drafty.
Don't!
Don't.
I know you think the Basses are evil.
Trust me, I get it.
I loved Chuck for so long and he's punished me for it.
He ended up treating me like something he owned, not like something he earned.
And it destroyed me.
I thought I'd never get over it.
But I finally found a way out of the darkness and you can too.
No.
I can't.
Don't!
Stop!
Chuck!
- Dad?
- Raina?
You shouldn't be here.
Neither should you.
But if you do this, you're taking me with you because I'm not leaving without you.
I know you didn't mean to hurt my mother.
The fire was an accident.
I forgive you.
You're going to jail for a very long time.
And I won't be coming to visit you.
Ever.
This just in.
Blair Waldorf, M.I.A. At Constance.
Doesn't she know her prince is waiting?
Or has she found a new one?
Nate and Raina are giving their statements to the cops.
Sure you don't want to go to the hospital?
I'm fine.
Or I will be.
I just want to get out of here.
Louis is waiting for me.
- I'll drive you.
- Thank you.
Not only for the ride, but for saving me.
What was I supposed to do?
You called.
Only because I couldn't see my phone to dial 911.
I still have you on speed dial.
I just had to push down the one.
The one, huh?
I'm so sorry.
I know.
How about a drink to calm your nerves?
Then, we can return you to your prince as steady as ever.
Okay.
One drink.
That's all.
Thank you.
Nate.
I wanna go home.
Okay.
We can get another cab.
Go to your hotel.
I don't mean the hotel.
You mean Chicago.
Ah...
Oh, my.
Closed for Joseph Nitzberg's Bar Mitzvah.
The Nitzbergs have great taste.
We should go back to the party.
Why?
Pretty much everyone we or Gossip Girl knows is there.
It's like we've been given the rest of the night off to do what we want.
Like that movie Death Takes a Holiday?
Not the Brad Pitt remake.
That was horrible.
What?
It was.
Helen and Murray Erlich sound nice.
Shall we?
- You scared me.
- I get that a lot.
Do you know where I could find a window that opens?
Most of them seem to be nailed shut and I could really use the fresh air.
Top floor, last room at the end of the hall.
Thanks for helping me.
Have you seen Charlie?
Maybe I have, maybe I haven't.
This is serious.
Every second you don't tell me is critical.
What if your kid in 17 years was in trouble and needed help?
If Milo isn't in trouble in 17 years, I've done something wrong.
But fine, I'll tell you where Charlie went.
But you owe me.
She took the elevator.
Thank you.
Oh.
I miss you!
You get me!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
All right!
Charlie?
Are you here?
So, that's it.
Go back to the real world.
You ready?
I'm sorry, my dear, but you need to give this up.
Blair isn't coming.
You asked her a question and this is her answer.
And the last thing I wanted was to see you be hurt.
Look what has happened.
I know she'll be here.
No, Carol.
I'm sorry.
We still haven't been able to find her.
I'll try Vanessa, see if she's had any luck.
Okay.
No.
We have everyone looking.
Watch out S, we find what we look for...
- Charlie.
...but never where we expect.
Charlie, no.
What are you doing?
Please come down from there.
I heard you talk to Dan and Vanessa about me.
You think I'm crazy.
Everyone does.
We don't.
We think you have a condition that can be helped.
If you come down, we can talk about it.
I'll get Dan if you want.
Dan doesn't like me.
That's why I stole your dress.
I'll never be like you.
I mean, you're Serena van der Woodsen.
That doesn't mean what you think it means.
Hey.
You okay?
You didn't call when you got in.
Is Charlie there?
No.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I got caught up.
I found your book.
- My what?
- Inside.
Dan, it's incredible.
You went through my stuff?
You have no right to do that.
I know, I'm sorry.
This could be the best satire on the Upper East Side since Bonfire of the Vanities.
How long have you been working on this?
Five years, off and on.
Now, put it back and we can forget you found it.
I always thought Serena was the reason you fell into the Upper East Side.
But it was more than that.
Seriously, this is none of your business.
You always wanted in.
Maybe more than Jenny.
The irony is that if I ever show it to anyone it'll guarantee my outsider status forever.
You know as well as I do you can't be an insider and make great art.
You have to stand alone to observe it and not care whose feelings you hurt or what people think.
Those people are my friends.
My best friends, my family.
It's not like any of them come across worse than you.
And someone might like the way she's painted.
And I'm not talking about Serena.
Get it published, take a stand.
Be a great man instead of a good boy.
Serena found Charlie.
I need to go.
Put the book back, get out of my room.
This is important.
Don't just drop everything to run and help them.
- Goodbye, Vanessa.
- When are you gonna realize you were a better person until you asked Serena out?
I had a better life before you climbed up my fire escape four years ago.
So...
I should find Louis and tell him it's over.
- Lf that's what you want.
- It's the right thing to do.
You really love him, don't you?
Yes.
But not like I love you.
With Louis and I, it's different.
It's lighter, more simple.
- He makes me happy.
- And I don't.
What we have is a great love.
It's complicated, intense, all-consuming.
No matter what we do and how much we fight, it'll always pull us in.
What's mere happiness in the face of all that, right?
So I'm sure Louis has left the party by now.
So I'll have to tell him at the consulate.
Drop me off at Constance, then you can take the limo.
Are you really going to tell me there's something wrong with being you?
Every girl wants to be you, every guy wants to date you.
- You can do anything you want.
- So can you.
All night, I've realized I didn't choose college.
I never chose between Dan or Nate.
I didn't even choose Paris last year.
Blair told me I was going.
Trust me, I know what it feels like.
When you're not making your own decisions, you can feel helpless because you don't wanna hurt anyone.
But all you end up doing is hurting them and yourself.
That's what I did and here I am alone.
You are not alone.
I'm here.
Good.
But if you could do it over again, what would you choose?
Dan or Nate?
What are you doing?
- You're still here?
- Why wouldn't I be?
The party's almost over.
I know but Blair hasn't arrived yet.
How can you be sure she's even coming?
Because I love her.
And just as important, I believe in her.
I know she's scared, but she'll figure it out.
And I'll be here when she does.
You left your...
- I knew you would come.
- I'm sorry it took me so long.
We need to talk.
I see.
- Louis...
- Blair.
No, I need to do this myself.
What I need to tell you is...
What she's trying to say is you have my blessing.
I couldn't be more happy the two of you are getting married.
Poor B. Don't you know timing is everything?
Looks like someone just stepped on your lines.
- Hey, what are you doing up here?
- Meeting Serena.
You too, huh?
Why do I feel like we've been here before?
Hey, how are you feeling?
I'll be okay, thanks.
- So, what are we doing here?
- I owe you both an apology.
- Something happen I don't know about?
- It's not what happened.
It's what didn't.
Last fall, I asked you to wait around while I figured things out and I never really did.
So I'm sorry if I hurt you both.
I hope you can find a way to forgive me.
- Of course we can.
- We already have.
- But it means a lot to hear it from you.
- I'm sorry too.
For everything I did that caused problems but especially for the way I acted with you, Dan.
What do you say we get your coat and take you home?
I'd like that, thank you.
Maybe I shouldn't have wanted to be you before, but now I definitely do.
- I'll get our coats.
- I'll get a cab.
Hey, I should call my mom and let her know that I'm okay.
Okay.
I'll be down there.
Hey, it's me.
I thought you should know it went perfectly.
I'll see you soon.
Did you find that open window?
Yeah, but I shouldn't have been looking for it anyways.
I was just off my meds.
No, I don't think so.
I don't think you were ever on meds.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bust you.
Since I assume you're about to be shipped off somewhere if you're ever back in the city, let me know.
It's been getting a little dull around here.
Why did you just do that?
- Because of what you said earlier.
- About being happy?
Chuck, that's not the most important thing.
People don't write sonnets about being compatible or novels about shared life goals and stimulating conversation.
The great loves are the crazy ones.
Blair, we're not living in Paris in the '20s.
- But we both wish we were.
- There's a difference between a great love and the right love.
I left the Empire State Building last year after two minutes when you didn't show.
Louis waited all night.
This is your chance at happiness.
You think you shouldn't want it because you've never had it and it scares you.
But you deserve your fairy tale.
- We'd make our own fairy tales.
- Only when we have to.
You don't.
How do you feel about tonight?
Awful.
Just terrible.
In fact, I've never felt like this before.
Guilt.
I feel it too.
Maybe I'm actually growing up after all.
I didn't wanna let you go just yet.
Don't let anyone tell you you're not powerful.
You're the most powerful woman I know.
It's taking all the power I have to walk away from you.
I know.
But I need to let you go.
And you need to let go.
I will always love you.
I will always love you.
Thank you for waiting.
I had to say goodbye.
This just in:
Chuck Bass and Blair Waldorf, happily never after.
They say parting is such sweet sorrow.
But wouldn't it be nice if just once, it didn't have to be?
They're saying 20 years.
Sounds fair.
That's how long he kept the secret.
I wouldn't wanna be in his shoes, I can tell you that.
What about in yours?
When's that?
Yeah, what are your plans for the summer?
I'm going to be getting very pale.
This doesn't come off until fall.
Just in time to send my baby off to college.
Sarah Lawrence is like 15 minutes away.
I don't think I need to be sent off.
A breeze could take me there.
You don't have to worry about sun damage.
And we don't have to spend August with Eleanor and Cyrus on that cruise.
Can you imagine?
I don't think the Principality of Monaco's yacht counts as a cruise, Mr. Humphrey.
Well, they didn't mention that.
Maybe there's still time to RSVP.
Well, on that note, I think I'll head out, Nathaniel.
I'll hitch a ride.
So Monaco for the summer.
Yeah.
Louis is picking me up in an hour.
- Flying private?
- Is there anything else?
- So you're really getting married, huh?
- Yes, and you're actually invited.
I bet you never thought you'd go to a royal wedding.
Only my own.
Think you could introduce me to Charlotte Casiraghi?
If the castle gets lonely, you wanna watch a movie with a friend...
I already copied your queue.
Our e-mail discourse begins Monday with Hal Ashby's The Landlord and we'll take it from there.
- Okay.
Hello?
It's your car, here to take you to the bus.
Are you sure you wanna take the bus, honey?
Yes.
After everything I've been through, I could really use the down time.
My mother was right.
This city isn't the best place for me.
Maybe someday I can come back and stay centered but for now, back to Florida.
Thank you.
I'm sad.
I kind of liked having a cousin around.
Me too.
I really did like you.
I really did like you too.
Transitions in life are usually marked by major events:
Birthdays, graduations, weddings.
- You must really be hurting.
- How can you tell?
You're not drinking.
I know it's serious when even you know you can't dull the pain.
I'm not right for her.
We bring out the dark side in each other.
When she's with Louis, she shines.
That's the Blair I love.
If she needs to be with him to be it, then that's the way it should be.
Well, look at that.
Chuck Bass maturing.
Heh.
Sad but true, I'm afraid.
I had Victor pick this up.
Being at St. Jude's reminded me of all the lost weekends we used to have.
So why not graduate to a lost summer?
A retreat?
Just spin the globe and pick a point.
We start there and make our way back here.
Like old times.
Bachelors who don't have to answer to anybody.
- You're a good friend.
- One of us has to be.
But the greater transitions often come out of smaller moments when we stop and look at who we are.
Because each time we see how far we've come we also see how far we still have to go.
Hey, can I borrow your sun hat?
Only if I can take your espadrilles.
I can't wait for Monaco.
Strolling in the Jardin Exotique catching the exhibits at Villa Paloma eating the lievre a la royale at Louis XV.
While I lay on the beach in Montecito, off the radar, learning to surf strolling through the farmers market while CeCe with a teacup of gin in hand harasses the help.
Well, you're going to have a lot of fun.
But are you sure you wanna be all by yourself the whole summer?
I know a palace with an empty room, or fifty.
Being alone is just what I need.
No boys, no bars just a bottle of sunblock and a dozen of the best beach reads.
I needed to make a choice, and I choose me.
Maybe the Grimaldis' yacht can moor for a couple days in Malibu and we can meet up.
- Oh, I'd love that.
- Hey, have you picked a date yet?
- We're thinking November.
That doesn't give me time to find a dress to outshine yours.
You know I'll be wearing white, of course.
I already told Louis' seamstresses to make your maid of honor dress in the brightest fuchsia they could find.
- Ugh.
- Thank you.
- Of course.
So with Lily locked up all summer you think you're gonna get stir crazy?
- Not really.
I'm producing Panic's album so I have company.
What about the Hamptons?
Is CeCe gonna be there this year?
No, she's staying in Montecito for Serena.
Ah.
You know, I'm ashamed to admit this, but I was looking forward to spending some time out there.
- Since when do you like the Hamptons?
- The city's been getting me down.
You sad about Charlie leaving?
You two were close.
- It's not Charlie he was talking about.
- Whoever or whatever it is the Hamptons house is empty and you have it all for yourself.
Wanna come?
We could be each other's wingmen like Nate and Chuck.
- Maybe break up a couple or two.
- Yeah, thank you.
Get me out of here.
With all the relaxing you do, maybe you can get a little writing done there.
I don't know.
I think maybe my writing days are behind me.
Hmm.
You were right.
I loved it.
So did my team here.
We think it's one of the best debut novels since Jonathan Safran Foer.
- Who exactly wrote it?
- I promised my client I wouldn't say.
I'm sure once it's published, the author will come forward.
- He'll have to.
- Where shall we send the checks?
To me.
I'll pass them along to the author.
- Barcelona?
- I'm moving there.
Nothing's really keeping me here.
In order to fully transform, we might need to free ourselves of everything we've been holding onto to send us on our new path.
The right one.
- Hi.
- Hi, sorry.
- Do we know each other?
- No, no, no.
The Beautiful and Damned, it's one of my favorite novels.
I can't believe you were reading it.
People only read novels here because they're trying to turn them into movies, so...
Which is exactly what you're doing, isn't it?
I lied to my boss about having read it.
I'm supposed to do a comparison of the book to the script.
Meeting's in an hour.
Any chance you could help me?
Well, I don't know how I feel about helping someone cut corners.
But if it's for the good of Fitzgerald, I suppose.
I don't have to meet my grandmother for another hour.
- Let's see.
How far did you get?
- Not far enough.
That's my boss.
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- David O. Russell.
- Hi.
Hi, I'm Dave.
- Hi, I'm Serena.
I'm such a huge fan of your work.
Are you turning The Beautiful and Damned into a movie?
Well, I'm trying to.
Do you have the notes for the meeting?
- Almost.
- Almost?
We gotta go.
I understand.
I've been working.
You're talking to a beautiful girl, which I understand, but...
Beautiful things only grow to a certain height and then they fail and fade off.
- You read the book.
- Of course.
- You read the book.
She read the book.
- I relate to it more than I should admit.
I got an idea.
We got the beautiful and the damned.
So this is not your assignment now.
If you want a job...
- Oh, my God.
I can get this done.
- She actually read the book.
What do you think?
- You can prepare me for the meeting.
- Um...
Yeah.
- Hi.
- How was the trip?
It was long, but nice.
They're all in there.
You can count.
Thank you, Ivy.
You played your part perfectly.
Well, thanks for hiring me.
I have to say, it was a pretty devious plan.
Well, you met my family.
- You know where I get it from.
- Yeah.
At least now they won't come looking for my daughter.
Gonna be all right going back to your life after having been a part of that world?
- I think I'll be fine.
- Good luck.
But if, at the end, you find the person you've become is not the person you want to be you can always turn around and try again.
And maybe the next time you won't be so alone when it's over.
Too late to turn back now.
XOXO, Gossip Girl.
We're asking everyone to do street parking.
I'm not street parking my Mercedes.
Well, everyone is.
I'm doing it.
'Cause nobody wants to steal a Saturn.
All right, uh, moving on to recycling.
- You okay, Ron?
- Just a little tooth pain.
I'm fine.
Continue.
Okay, each department will be getting blue bins...
Do you need to go to the dentist, Ron?
I don't like dentists.
Just a second.
- Hey.
- No, no.
No!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!
Aah!
- Oh!
- What the?
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, everybody.
What were we talking about...
Recycling?
Dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday.
But it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your co-workers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.
Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint.
Attention, everybody!
Everybody, listen up.
You are all officially invited to a dinner party, 7:00 P.M. tonight at our home, which is officially my friend Burly's home, because I don't have a home.
That's it.
There's no more left.
Give it to him.
We've been dating for almost a month, so we just decided that we wanted to do something special.
And dinner parties do combine two of our favorite things... dinner and parties.
- Parties.
- Yeah.
It's like if you could have a Xbox pancake.
Your invitations include requests for each of you to bring stuff, 'cause we don't have a whole lot.
- Don't be late.
- Watch out.
"Dearest Tom, please bring silverware."
- "Please bring cooked steak."
- This is ridiculous.
They're young.
They're in love.
They're ready to show it to the world.
It's very sweet.
- And we're all going.
- What?
There's a boy's sale at Dillard's today.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
You going tonight?
Yeah.
Apparently they want me to bring Avatar and 50 pairs of 3-d glasses and a 3-d-capable television.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Well, I will see you there, with all of those things.
I was actually coming to see you.
I wanted your advice on something.
- Oh, yeah?
- My boss in Indianapolis...
He wants me back on the road in a week.
But then this morning Chris offered me a job to stay here in Pawnee and work for him.
- Do you want to do that?
- Well, I don't know.
I've been moving around so much the past few years, it might be nice to stay in one place for a while.
- What do you think?
- Well, this is a great city.
You know, it's definitely the best city in Indiana, probably America, possibly the world.
Sure.
But on the other hand, you've put in 12 years with the state government.
So you think I should say no to Chris and head back to Indianapolis or...?
It's a tough call.
You know what I would do?
You should make a pros and cons list.
- That always works for me.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, maybe I'll do that.
Excellent.
Nice talking to you.
- Good stuff.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So how does this work?
All right, you just fill out your name tag,
- and you're all set.
- Okay.
But I-I mean, do I just go up and talk to anyone, or do I wait for them to talk to me, or...?
Are you asking me how to flirt with men?
Okay.
All right.
It's a whole new Ann Perkins.
I'm putting myself out there, meeting some new people, having some casual fun, and it is...awkward.
Gayle went out and got me this new party shirt.
So be honest...
What do you guys think?
You know what, Jerry?
I make fun of you a lot, but credit where credit is due.
You know, I like how the...
Damn it.
I was so close.
It's a terrible shirt.
Hey, guys.
Okay, everybody listen up.
April's friend Orin is here.
He's very intense and very weird.
So if you end up talking to him, just make sure you don't reveal anything personal about yourself.
- Hey, gang.
- Hey.
- What'd you bring?
- I was in charge of the cake.
To be fair, it's not a cake so much as it is a vegetable loaf.
You got your mushrooms, your alfalfa sprouts, your spinach, and I had it sweetened with fruit reduction.
But did they ask you to bring a vegetable loaf or a cake?
No, a cake, but this is so much healthier.
So not only does this thing exist, but now you have deprived everyone of cake.
- Take a walk, Ron.
- Yep.
Donna.
Oh, my God.
I am so excited to see you here.
These things are horrible when you're by yourself.
What?
Do you know where you are right now?
We're in the jungle.
There are no friends here.
It's every woman for herself.
- You're joking, right?
- Do I look like I'm joking?
Dating is a zero-sum game.
If you get a man, I don't get that man.
I'm here because of advice that you gave me to be more adventurous in my life.
Here's some more advice...
Beat it.
Hey.
Ben, heard you might be leaving Pawnee.
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.
Well, you are a huge nerd.
But I'd be sorry to see you go, man.
Thanks, Tom.
Okay, this party needs a little help.
I'll be right back.
So are you going on, like, a year-long walking tour of the set of The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand?
To be honest with you, I wasn't a fan of, uh, Peter Jackson's interpretation.
So you can put that one away.
Andy, I think you maybe should put some more food out.
Totally agree.
Just firing up the bagel bites now.
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.
What do you think?
April, you're not supposed to let me see you.
No, come on.
You have to look.
This is important.
You have to tell me if I look good.
Hey, guys, what's going on?
Uh, it's supposed to be a big surprise.
But tonight me and April are getting married...
To each other.
- Are you pregnant?
- Yes.
- Yes?
- No.
Are you sick?
Are you terminal?
Is it like that movie A Walk to Remember?
- Yes.
- What?
- No.
God.
- Oh, God.
Why are you doing this?
Why is this great thing happening?
Well, I mean, it's actually a really funny story.
We were hanging out.
And suddenly, I was like,
"What if we got married tomorrow?"
And she was like...
"Fine."
- She's fine.
- That is a great story.
But you guys haven't been together very long, and you have no place to live.
We've been together long enough, and we'll find a place to live.
Yeah.
Like, a house or, like, a condo or something.
Probably a condo.
It's... you can't just get a condo.
No, you're right...
house.
I love Andy and April as a couple.
I want them to stay together forever.
But relationships need planning.
You just can't jump into something without thinking.
It took me four years to find the right hairdresser, and we still fight all the time!
Andy and April are gonna surprise people with a secret ceremony.
Whoa.
Secret wedding.
Julia Roberts pulled the same move.
Is that that toothy girl from Mystic Pizza?
Ron, please, I need you to help me knock some sense into them.
It's not really my place or yours.
- Hi.
I'm Ann.
- Brian.
What's your occupation?
I'm a manager at a sporting-goods store.
- No way.
Me too.
- Seriously?
Which one?
No, I'm not.
Um, I-I was just ribbing you.
- What are you drinking?
- Yeah.
- What?
- Oh, I don't know.
I-I couldn't hear you.
So you just laughed and said, "Yeah"?
- Yeah.
- Excuse us.
That was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
Did you grow up in the woods?
Are you Nell from the movie Nell?
I told you I'm rusty.
All right, come with me.
- Hey, Andy.
- Yeah.
I know what's going down, and I'm so happy for you guys.
Thank you, Tom.
Hey, something just occurred to me.
- Can I be your best man?
- Yeah, dude, totally.
- Thank you.
- My best man.
One of my life goals is to be a best man.
It's a baller position.
You get drunk.
You make speeches.
And you make love to the prettiest bridesmaid, usually standing from behind.
Look, I know that I cannot tell you what to do.
I know it doesn't work...
From all the times I've tried to tell you what to do before.
But you know what would be fun?
Maybe we should make a pros and cons list.
Let me take you home, and then we'll go do that together.
It'll be a blast.
- Leslie, relax.
- You relax.
You relax all the way home and get into bed.
- You need to go to bed.
- April.
Girl talk.
Hey, uh, what's your middle name?
The justice of the peace lady needs to know.
You don't know each other's middle names?
I don't want to say it out loud.
- Ew!
- Shut up.
- Roberta!
- Such a loser.
- Can't believe I'm marrying him.
- You don't have to.
I'm going to.
And then I'm gonna divorce him.
Then I'm gonna marry him again.
One time, I fell madly in love with a Civil War reenactor that I had only known for six hours.
And then I found out he wore those clothes all the time.
And he was married.
But the clothes thing really bothered me.
You always want to scribble the name.
Make them read.
Draw them in.
- Make them work for it.
- Right.
Two shots of Jameson.
Don't make too much eye contact.
You want to seem available, but not too available.
Oh, thanks.
I think I'm good for now.
- I'm not gonna...
- Yeah.
All right...
Let's do this.
Ron, you are so amazing with me and April, stuff.
I love you, man.
Would you be one of my best men?
I'd be honored to, son.
Chris, you helped me get April back.
Would you be my best man?
Nothing else in my entire life would make me happier as long as I live.
Jerry.
Ah, I'm so glad you made it.
This shirt is hilarious.
Derek and Ben, will you be my best men?
Got a little competition for the best man, huh?
Well, you know what the best best man does.
Excuse me!
Are there any strippers here?
Former strippers?
Non-dancers but you're feeling a little bit drunk?
What are you doing?
I'm throwing Andy an impromptu bachelor party.
It's my duty as best man.
The wedding's in four minutes.
It's that kind of negative thinking that makes you a less good best man.
Hello?
Hi, Ann, it's Leslie...
Leslie Knope from the Parks Department.
Yeah, I know.
Where are you?
April and Andy are getting married tonight.
- What?
- Yeah, I know.
I need you to get down here, Ann.
I need you to kiss him again or kiss her or kiss somebody.
I don't know, Ann!
Help me, please!
Relationships are like scuba diving.
If you come up too fast, you get the bends.
And the reason why I know this is because I was dating a guy once, and we were scuba diving, and I told him that I loved him underwater, and he shot up really fast, and he got the bends.
No, Orin, I don't know how I'm going to die.
Wait.
Are you asking me or telling me?
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yes, please.
April and Andy are about to get married.
Wow.
My Brita filter is older than their relationship.
Wait a second.
Should I change my Brita filter?
I don't know.
It depends on how frequently you use it.
- It's true.
- Stay focused, okay?
Please.
The point is two boneheads whom I love dearly are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through.
And nobody seems concerned about this.
Attention, everybody.
Madames and...
Mis...
Wahs.
If you would do me the obligation of having your honor heretofore in the room doth right over there, uh, hence.
What?
Big event in that room, 15 minutes.
Oh, my God.
This is really happening.
I love April and Andy.
I want them to stay together.
And that is why I have to stop their wedding.
Remember how I told you there was going to be a surprise later?
Well, the surprise is you're not actually at a dinner party.
You're at our wedding.
All right.
Uh, let's do this.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to marry Andrew Maxwell Dwyer and April Roberta Ludgate.
I guess I kind of hate most things.
But I never really seem to hate you.
So I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
- Is that cool?
- Yes.
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.
"April, you're the most awesome person I have ever known
"in my entire life.
"I vow to protect you from danger.
"And I don't care if I have to fight
"an ultimate fighter or a bear or him,
"your mom...
I would take them down."
Andy.
I'm getting mad right now even thinking about it.
- I'm telling you.
- It's okay.
I want to spend the rest of my life... every minute...
with you.
And I'm the luckiest man in the galaxy.
And now the rings.
By the power vested in me by the state of Indiana,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
- Go fly away.
- Fly.
Fly.
- Wings of love.
- Oh.
Okay.
All right.
So that one is dead.
We know that.
You wouldn't have been able to stop it, you know.
I could've yelled something or tackled someone.
But you didn't, because deep down, you knew it wouldn't have mattered.
Those kids are gonna do what they want to do.
They may have just ruined their lives on an impulse decision.
Leslie, I got married twice.
Both times, I was a lot older than those two.
And both marriages ended in divorce...
And a burning effigy.
Who's to say what works?
You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice.
That's all anybody can do.
Wait.
Weren't you married three times?
Oh, my God, you're right.
I get to burn another effigy.
The key to burning an ex-wife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol...
From a safe distance.
Do not stand too close when you light an ex-wife effigy.
My sister is lame, but Andy's sort of cool.
I guess I kind of see why he'd marry her.
Also, if anyone finds my gray hoodie, I lost it.
Thanks.
That was beautiful.
You two remind me of me and my husband, George.
I got to nail the speech.
So I brought in an expert...
Jean-Ralphio.
Can I throw something on you, see if it feels good?
Sure.
Okay, this is what I would do.
I would start with a joke.
Joke, Vince Vaughn quote, obviously.
Swingers Crashers?
Fred Claus.
Talk about Andy's ex-girlfriends.
Quote from Love Actually.
Hold back your tears.
Pause.
Drop the microphone.
Get out of that bitch.
I wish you the best of luck, to both of you.
Aw, thank you, grandma.
How can anyone ever possibly top that?
Am I right?
So thank you all for all the talking.
Let's just get back to dancing, huh?
Cool.
See you around maybe.
- That went better, right?
- Yes, it did.
However, he proudly told me that he "beat herpes."
I'm sorry, Donna.
I'm gonna go home.
I just found out Andy's getting married.
- So?
- So that's my ex-boyfriend.
We were together for a really long time.
- All right.
- What?
What?
Listen, you are a hot, young doctor.
- I'm a nurse, actually.
- Okay, I don't know you.
But I do know that you can fix your attitude.
Do you want to go home and feel sorry for yourself about a man you didn't want to marry?
Or do you want to go talk to that cute boy who has been looking at you and give him your number before I throw him in my Benz for myself?
All right.
I just want to thank my family, my friends, most importantly, my best best man,
Mr. Tom Haverford.
Oh!
Coolest guy I know.
And, ladies, he's single, I think.
You're not still married, are you?
- No.
- But you... you're straight?
- Yes.
- Jean-Ralphio's just a friend?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
Anyways, oh, my God, I'm married!
This is crazy.
What happened?
But, seriously, life is short, right?
Uh, just...
I really think you should just do whatever makes you happy.
That's what April and I did.
We are in love.
So we didn't overthink it.
I mean, seriously, I cannot emphasize how little we thought about this.
Am I right?
All right, well, this is a song I wrote for you,
April Roberta Ludgate.
I love you.
Exactly.
Mortality.
See, I like to take each day at a time.
There's nothing in the world we can't accomplish if we try.
I have to go.
It's been great talking to you.
- Hey.
- Don't worry.
I'm not gonna say another word.
This is your day.
I just wanted to say that...
I'm really glad you're here.
I think you're awesome, and I love you.
Oh.
What's the deal with that hot girl, April?
- What's the deal with her?
- Yeah.
Like, she good to go?
Like, she down to clown?
She's married.
She got married, like, 20 minutes ago.
Oh, my God.
That's the same girl from the thing.
From the wedding ceremony, yeah.
All the good ones are taken, huh, bro?
Yeah.
Hey.
You should stay.
Don't go back to Indianapolis.
You should stay here.
- You think?
- Yeah.
Yes.
It's a great city here, you know?
And there are great people.
And you've made a lot of friends.
And what are you gonna do...
Go back to your old job and hack up people's budgets?
Stay here.
Help us build something.
I already accepted the job.
- I'm, uh...
I'm staying here.
- That's good.
Yeah, I think so.
- Orin's behind me, isn't he?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- So just keep your eyes on me.
- Okay.
Don't panic, 'cause he can smell fear.
Just keep talking to me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
How are you?
- How was the wedding...
- Run.
"Hope we can get together soon."
Okay, now you write, "Who is this?"
Ah.
Hey, you guys, we got a video from April and Andy.
- Oh.
Okay.
- Whoo!
Yeah!
How you guys doing?
- Hey, we're on our honeymoon.
- It is awesome.
We're at Burly's family vacation house on Lake Michigan.
We're having so much fun, except for, uh, Roberta here turns out sucks at water-skiing so bad.
I'm gonna divorce you.
Andy sucks at driving a boat.
And I'm gonna divorce him, probably right now.
Well, they're still together.
You owe me 20 bucks.
So, while they re-paint the lines in the parking lot, we're asking everyone to do street parking.
I'm not street parking my Mercedes.
Well, everyone is.
I'm doing it.
'Cause nobody wants to steal a Saturn.
All right, moving on to recycling.
You okay, Ron?
Just a little tooth pain.
I'm fine.
Continue.
Okay, each department will be getting blue bins...
Do you need to go to the dentist, Ron?
I don't like dentists.
Just a second.
Hey.
No, no.
No!
No, no, no, no!
Oh!
What the?
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, everybody.
What were we talking about?
Recycling?
Dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday.
But it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your co-workers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.
Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint.
Attention, everybody!
Everybody, listen up.
You are all officially invited to a dinner party, 7:00 p.m. tonight at our home, which is officially my friend Burly's home, because I don't have a home.
That's it.
There's no more left.
Give it to him.
We've been dating for almost a month, so we just decided that we wanted to do something special.
And dinner parties do combine two of our favorite things, dinner and parties.
Parties.
Yeah.
It's like if you could have a Xbox pancake.
Your invitations include requests for each of you to bring stuff, 'cause we don't have a whole lot.
Don't be late.
Watch out.
"Dearest Tom, please bring silverware."
"Please bring cooked steak."
This is ridiculous.
They're young.
They're in love.
They're ready to show it to the world.
It's very sweet.
And we're all going.
- What?
There's a boy's sale at Dillard's today.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
You going tonight?
Yeah.
Apparently they want me to bring Avatar, and 50 pairs of 3-D glasses, and a 3-D-capable television.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Well, I will see you there, with all of those things.
I was actually coming to see you.
I wanted your advice on something.
Oh, yeah?
My boss in Indianapolis, he wants me back on the road in a week.
But then this morning, Chris offered me a job to stay here in Pawnee and work for him.
Do you wanna do that?
Well, I don't know.
I've been moving around so much the past few years.
It might be nice to stay in one place for a while.
What do you think?
Well, this is a great city.
You know, it's definitely the best city in Indiana, probably America, possibly the world.
Sure.
But on the other hand, you've put in 12 years with the state government.
So you think I should say no to Chris and head back to Indianapolis or...
It's a tough call.
You know what I would do?
You should make a pros and cons list.
That always works for me.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, maybe I'll do that.
Excellent.
Nice talking to you.
Good stuff.
Okay.
Yeah.
So how does this work?
All right, you just fill out your name tag, and you're all set.
Okay.
But I mean, do I just go up and talk to anyone, or do I wait for them to talk to me, or...
Are you asking me how to flirt with men?
Okay.
All right.
It's a whole new Ann Perkins.
I'm putting myself out there, meeting some new people, having some casual fun, and it is awkward.
Gayle went out and got me this new party shirt.
So be honest, what do you guys think?
You know what, Jerry?
I make fun of you a lot, but credit where credit is due.
You know, I like how the...
Damn it.
I was so close.
It's a terrible shirt.
Hey, guys.
Okay, everybody listen up.
April's friend Orin is here.
He's very intense and very weird.
So if you end up talking to him, just make sure you don't reveal anything personal about yourself.

We're in the jungle.
There are no friends here.

If you get a man, I don't get that man.
I'm here because of advice that you gave me to be more adventurous in my life.
Here's some more advice.

Hey.
Ben, heard you might be leaving Pawnee.
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.
Well, you are a huge nerd.
But I'd be sorry to see you go, man.
Thanks, Tom.
Okay, this party needs a little help.
I'll be right back.
So are you going on, like, a year-Iong walking tour of the set of The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand?
To be honest with you, I wasn't a fan of Peter Jackson's interpretation.
So you can put that one away.
Andy, I think you maybe should put some more food out.
Totally agree.
Just firing up the Bagel Bites now.
Hey.
Oh, my God.
What do you think?
April, you're not supposed to let me see you.
No, come on.
You have to look.
This is important.
You have to tell me if I look good.
Hey, guys, what's going on?
Uh...
It's supposed to be a big surprise.
But tonight, me and April are getting married.
To each other.
Is April pregnant?
Are you pregnant?
Yes.
Yes?
No.
Are you sick?
Are you terminal?
Is it like that movie A Walk to Remember?
Yes.
What?
No.
God.
Oh, God.
Why are you doing this?
Why is this great thing happening?
Well, I mean, it's actually a really funny story.
We were hanging out.
And suddenly, I was like,
"What if we got married tomorrow?"
And she was like...
"Fine."
She's like, "Fine."
That is a great story.
But you guys haven't been together very long, and you have no place to live.
We've been together long enough, and we'll find a place to live.
Yeah.
Like, a house or, like, a condo or something.
Probably a condo.
You can't just get a condo.
No, you're right.
House.

You need to go to bed.

You don't know each other's middle names?
I don't wanna say it out loud.

Such a loser.
Can't believe I'm marrying him.
You don't have to.
I'm going to.

I think I'm good for now.
I'm not gonna...

My Brita filter's older than their relationship.

True.
Stay focused, okay?
Please.
The point is two boneheads, whom I love dearly, are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through.

Attention, everybody.
Mesdames and...
Missoirs.
If you would do me the obligation of having your honor, heretofore, in the room doth right over there, hence.
What?
Big event in that room, 15 minutes.
Oh, my God.
This is really happening.
I love April and Andy.
I want them to stay together.
And that is why I have to stop their wedding.
Hi, guys, remember how I told you there was going to be a surprise later?
Well, the surprise is you are not actually at a dinner party.
You're at our wedding.
All right.
Let's do this.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to marry Andrew Maxwell Dwyer and April Roberta Ludgate.
I guess I kind of hate most things.
But I never really seem to hate you.
So, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
Is that cool?
Yes.
Is it my turn?
Yes.
"April, you're the most awesome person
"I have ever known in my entire life.
"I vow to protect you from danger.
"I don't care if I have to fight
"an ultimate fighter, or a bear, or him,
"your mom...
I would take 'em down."
Andy.
I'm getting mad right now even thinking about it.
I'm telling you.
It's okay.
I wanna spend the rest of my life, every minute, with you.
And I'm the luckiest man in the galaxy.
And now the rings.
By the power vested in me by the State of Indiana,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Go fly away.
Fly!
Fly!
Wings of love.
Okay.
All right.
So that one is dead.
We know that.
You wouldn't have been able to stop it, you know.
I could've yelled something or tackled someone.
But you didn't, because deep down, you knew it wouldn't have mattered.
Those kids are gonna do what they wanna do.
They may have just ruined their lives on an impulse decision.
Leslie, I got married twice.
Both times, I was a lot older than those two.
And both marriages ended in divorce...
And a burning effigy.
Who's to say what works?
You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice.
That's all anybody can do.
Wait.
Weren't you married three times?
Oh, my God, you're right.
I get to burn another effigy.
The key to burning an ex-wife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol from a safe distance.
Do not stand too close when you light an ex-wife effigy.
My sister is lame, but Andy's sort of cool.
I guess I kind of see why he'd marry her.
Also, if anyone finds my gray hoodie, I lost it.
Thanks.
That was beautiful.
You two remind me of me and my husband, George.
I gotta nail the speech.
So I brought in an expert.
Jean-Ralphio.
Can I throw something on you, see if it feels good?
Sure.
Okay, this is what I would do.
I would start with a joke.
Joke, Vince Vaughn quote, obviously.
Swingers or Crashers?
Fred Claus.
Talk about Andy's ex-girlfriends.
Quote from Love Actually.
Hold back your tears.
Pause.
Drop the microphone.
Get out of that bitch.
I wish you the best of luck, to both of you.
Thank you, Grandma.
How could anyone ever possibly top that?
Am I right?
So, thank you all for all the talking.
Let's just get back to dancing, huh?
Cool.
See you around, maybe.
That went better, right?
Yes, it did.
However, he proudly told me that he "beat herpes."
I'm sorry, Donna.
I'm gonna go home.
I just found out Andy's getting married.
So?
So that's my ex-boyfriend.
We were together for a really long time.
All right.
What?
What?
Listen, you are a hot, young doctor.
I'm a nurse, actually.
Okay, I don't know you.
But I do know that you can fix your attitude.
Do you wanna go home and feel sorry for yourself about a man you didn't wanna marry?
Or do you wanna go talk to that cute boy, who has been looking at you, and give him your number before I throw him in my Benz for myself?
All right.
I just wanna thank my family, my friends, most importantly, my best best man, Mr. Tom Haverford.
Oh!
Coolest guy I know.
And, ladies, he's single, I think.
You're not still married, are you?
No.
But you...
You're straight?
Yes.
Jean-Ralphio's just a friend?
Yeah.
Yeah!
Anyways, oh, my God, I'm married!
This is crazy.
What happened?
But, seriously, life is short, right?
Uh, just...
I really think you should just do whatever makes you happy.
That's what April and I did.
We are in love.
So we didn't overthink it.
I mean, seriously, I cannot emphasize how little we thought about this.
Am I right?
All right, well, this is a song I wrote for you,
April Roberta Ludgate.
I love you.
I love you.
Yeah, yeah
Oh, Grandma
April, there's so little time
The things I really want to do
Let's fly to the sky
It's so awesome
Exactly.
Mortality.
See, I like to take each day at a time.
There's nothing in the world we can't accomplish if we try.
I have to go.
It's been great talking to you.
Hey.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna say another word.
This is your day.
I just wanted to say that...
I'm really glad you're here.
I think you're awesome, and I love you.
What's the deal with that hot girl, April?
What's the deal with her?
Yeah.
Like, is she good to go?
Like, is she down to clown?
She's married.
She got married, like, 20 minutes ago.
Oh, my God.
That's the same girl from the thing.
From the wedding ceremony, yeah.
All the good ones are taken, huh, bro?
Yeah.
Hey.
You should stay.
Don't go back to Indianapolis.
You should stay here.
You think?
Yeah.
Yes.
It's a great city here, you know?
And there are great people.
And you've made a lot of friends.
And what are you gonna do?
You gonna go back to your old job and hack up people's budgets?
Stay here.
Help us build something.
I already accepted the job.
I'm staying here.
That's good.
Yeah, I think so.
Orin's behind me, isn't he?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
So just keep your eyes on me.
Okay.
Don't panic, 'cause he can smell fear.
What do I...
Just keep talking to me.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
How was the wedding?
Run!
"Hey, Ann, it was great talking to you last night.
"Hope we can get together soon."
Okay, now you write, "Who is this?"
Hey, you guys, we got a video from April and Andy.
Oh.
Okay.
How you guys doing?
Hey, we're on our honeymoon.
It is awesome.
We're at Burly's family vacation house on Lake Michigan.
We're having so much fun.
Except for Roberta, here, turns out, sucks at water skiing.
Oh, my God.
So bad.
I'm gonna divorce you.
Andy sucks at driving a boat.
And I'm gonna divorce him, probably right now.
Well, they're still together.
You owe me 20 bucks.
We're asking everyone to do street parking.
I'm not street parking my Mercedes.
Well, everyone is.
I'm doing it.
'Cause nobody wants to steal a Saturn.
All right, uh, moving on to recycling.
- You okay, Ron?
- Just a little tooth pain.
I'm fine.
Continue.
Okay, each department will be getting blue bins...
Do you need to go to the dentist, Ron?
I don't like dentists.
Just a second.
- Hey.
- No, no.
No!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!
Aah!
- Oh!
- What the?
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, everybody.
What were we talking about...
Recycling?
Dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday.
But it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your co-workers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.
Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint.
Attention, everybody!
Everybody, listen up.
You are all officially invited to a dinner party, 7:00 P.M. tonight at our home, which is officially my friend Burly's home, because I don't have a home.
That's it.
There's no more left.
Give it to him.
We've been dating for almost a month, so we just decided that we wanted to do something special.
And dinner parties do combine two of our favorite things... dinner and parties.
- Parties.
- Yeah.
It's like if you could have a Xbox pancake.
Your invitations include requests for each of you to bring stuff, 'cause we don't have a whole lot.
- Don't be late.
- Watch out.
"Dearest Tom, please bring silverware."
- "Please bring cooked steak."
- This is ridiculous.
They're young.
They're in love.
They're ready to show it to the world.
It's very sweet.
- And we're all going.
- What?
There's a boy's sale at Dillard's today.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
You going tonight?
Yeah.
Apparently they want me to bring Avatar and 50 pairs of 3-d glasses and a 3-d-capable television.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Well, I will see you there, with all of those things.
I was actually coming to see you.
I wanted your advice on something.
- Oh, yeah?
- My boss in Indianapolis...
He wants me back on the road in a week.
But then this morning Chris offered me a job to stay here in Pawnee and work for him.
- Do you want to do that?
- Well, I don't know.
I've been moving around so much the past few years, it might be nice to stay in one place for a while.
- What do you think?
- Well, this is a great city.
You know, it's definitely the best city in Indiana, probably America, possibly the world.
Sure.
But on the other hand, you've put in 12 years with the state government.
So you think I should say no to Chris and head back to Indianapolis or...?
It's a tough call.
You know what I would do?
You should make a pros and cons list.
- That always works for me.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, maybe I'll do that.
Excellent.
Nice talking to you.
- Good stuff.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So how does this work?
All right, you just fill out your name tag,
- and you're all set.
- Okay.
But I-I mean, do I just go up and talk to anyone, or do I wait for them to talk to me, or...?
Are you asking me how to flirt with men?
Okay.
All right.
It's a whole new Ann Perkins.
I'm putting myself out there, meeting some new people, having some casual fun, and it is...awkward.
Gayle went out and got me this new party shirt.
So be honest...
What do you guys think?
You know what, Jerry?
I make fun of you a lot, but credit where credit is due.
You know, I like how the...
Damn it.
I was so close.
It's a terrible shirt.
Hey, guys.
Okay, everybody listen up.
April's friend Orin is here.
He's very intense and very weird.
So if you end up talking to him, just make sure you don't reveal anything personal about yourself.
- Hey, gang.
- Hey.
- What'd you bring?
- I was in charge of the cake.
To be fair, it's not a cake so much as it is a vegetable loaf.
You got your mushrooms, your alfalfa sprouts, your spinach, and I had it sweetened with fruit reduction.
But did they ask you to bring a vegetable loaf or a cake?
No, a cake, but this is so much healthier.
So not only does this thing exist, but now you have deprived everyone of cake.
- Take a walk, Ron.
- Yep.
Donna.
Oh, my God.
I am so excited to see you here.
These things are horrible when you're by yourself.
What?
Do you know where you are right now?
We're in the jungle.
There are no friends here.
It's every woman for herself.
- You're joking, right?
- Do I look like I'm joking?
Dating is a zero-sum game.
If you get a man, I don't get that man.
I'm here because of advice that you gave me to be more adventurous in my life.
Here's some more advice...
Beat it.
Hey.
Ben, heard you might be leaving Pawnee.
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.
Well, you are a huge nerd.
But I'd be sorry to see you go, man.
Thanks, Tom.
Okay, this party needs a little help.
I'll be right back.
So are you going on, like, a year-long walking tour of the set of The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand?
To be honest with you, I wasn't a fan of, uh, Peter Jackson's interpretation.
So you can put that one away.
Andy, I think you maybe should put some more food out.
Totally agree.
Just firing up the bagel bites now.
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.
What do you think?
April, you're not supposed to let me see you.
No, come on.
You have to look.
This is important.
You have to tell me if I look good.
Hey, guys, what's going on?
Uh, it's supposed to be a big surprise.
But tonight me and April are getting married...
To each other.
- Are you pregnant?
- Yes.
- Yes?
- No.
Are you sick?
Are you terminal?
Is it like that movie A Walk to Remember?
- Yes.
- What?
- No.
God.
- Oh, God.
Why are you doing this?
Why is this great thing happening?
Well, I mean, it's actually a really funny story.
We were hanging out.
And suddenly, I was like,
"What if we got married tomorrow?"
And she was like...
"Fine."
- She's fine.
- That is a great story.
But you guys haven't been together very long, and you have no place to live.
We've been together long enough, and we'll find a place to live.
Yeah.
Like, a house or, like, a condo or something.
Probably a condo.
It's... you can't just get a condo.
No, you're right...
house.
I love Andy and April as a couple.
I want them to stay together forever.
But relationships need planning.
You just can't jump into something without thinking.
It took me four years to find the right hairdresser, and we still fight all the time!
Andy and April are gonna surprise people with a secret ceremony.
Whoa.
Secret wedding.
Julia Roberts pulled the same move.
Is that that toothy girl from Mystic Pizza?
Ron, please, I need you to help me knock some sense into them.
It's not really my place or yours.
- Hi.
I'm Ann.
- Brian.
What's your occupation?
I'm a manager at a sporting-goods store.
- No way.
Me too.
- Seriously?
Which one?
No, I'm not.
Um, I-I was just ribbing you.
- What are you drinking?
- Yeah.
- What?
- Oh, I don't know.
I-I couldn't hear you.
So you just laughed and said, "Yeah"?
- Yeah.
- Excuse us.
That was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
Did you grow up in the woods?
Are you Nell from the movie Nell?
I told you I'm rusty.
All right, come with me.
- Hey, Andy.
- Yeah.
I know what's going down, and I'm so happy for you guys.
Thank you, Tom.
Hey, something just occurred to me.
- Can I be your best man?
- Yeah, dude, totally.
- Thank you.
- My best man.
One of my life goals is to be a best man.
It's a baller position.
You get drunk.
You make speeches.
And you make love to the prettiest bridesmaid, usually standing from behind.
Look, I know that I cannot tell you what to do.
I know it doesn't work...
From all the times I've tried to tell you what to do before.
But you know what would be fun?
Maybe we should make a pros and cons list.
Let me take you home, and then we'll go do that together.
It'll be a blast.
- Leslie, relax.
- You relax.
You relax all the way home and get into bed.
- You need to go to bed.
- April.
Girl talk.
Hey, uh, what's your middle name?
The justice of the peace lady needs to know.
You don't know each other's middle names?
I don't want to say it out loud.
- Ew!
- Shut up.
- Roberta!
- Such a loser.
- Can't believe I'm marrying him.
- You don't have to.
I'm going to.
And then I'm gonna divorce him.
Then I'm gonna marry him again.
One time, I fell madly in love with a Civil War reenactor that I had only known for six hours.
And then I found out he wore those clothes all the time.
And he was married.
But the clothes thing really bothered me.
You always want to scribble the name.
Make them read.
Draw them in.
- Make them work for it.
- Right.
Two shots of Jameson.
Don't make too much eye contact.
You want to seem available, but not too available.
Oh, thanks.
I think I'm good for now.
- I'm not gonna...
- Yeah.
All right...
Let's do this.
Ron, you are so amazing with me and April, stuff.
I love you, man.
Would you be one of my best men?
I'd be honored to, son.
Chris, you helped me get April back.
Would you be my best man?
Nothing else in my entire life would make me happier as long as I live.
Jerry.
Ah, I'm so glad you made it.
This shirt is hilarious.
Derek and Ben, will you be my best men?
Got a little competition for the best man, huh?
Well, you know what the best best man does.
Excuse me!
Are there any strippers here?
Former strippers?
Non-dancers but you're feeling a little bit drunk?
What are you doing?
I'm throwing Andy an impromptu bachelor party.
It's my duty as best man.
The wedding's in four minutes.
It's that kind of negative thinking that makes you a less good best man.
Hello?
Hi, Ann, it's Leslie...
Leslie Knope from the Parks Department.
Yeah, I know.
Where are you?
April and Andy are getting married tonight.
- What?
- Yeah, I know.
I need you to get down here, Ann.
I need you to kiss him again or kiss her or kiss somebody.
I don't know, Ann!
Help me, please!
Relationships are like scuba diving.
If you come up too fast, you get the bends.
And the reason why I know this is because I was dating a guy once, and we were scuba diving, and I told him that I loved him underwater, and he shot up really fast, and he got the bends.
No, Orin, I don't know how I'm going to die.
Wait.
Are you asking me or telling me?
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yes, please.
April and Andy are about to get married.
Wow.
My Brita filter is older than their relationship.
Wait a second.
Should I change my Brita filter?
I don't know.
It depends on how frequently you use it.
- It's true.
- Stay focused, okay?
Please.
The point is two boneheads whom I love dearly are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through.
And nobody seems concerned about this.
Attention, everybody.
Madames and...
Mis...
Wahs.
If you would do me the obligation of having your honor heretofore in the room doth right over there, uh, hence.
What?
Big event in that room, 15 minutes.
Oh, my God.
This is really happening.
I love April and Andy.
I want them to stay together.
And that is why I have to stop their wedding.

"I vow to protect you from danger.
"And I don't care if I have to fight
"an ultimate fighter or a bear or him,
"your mom...
I would take them down."
Andy.
I'm getting mad right now even thinking about it.
- I'm telling you.
- It's okay.
I want to spend the rest of my life... every minute...
with you.
And I'm the luckiest man in the galaxy.
And now the rings.
By the power vested in me by the state of Indiana,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
- Go fly away.
- Fly.
Fly.
- Wings of love.
- Oh.
Okay.
All right.
So that one is dead.

Let's just get back to dancing, huh?
Cool.
See you around maybe.
- That went better, right?
- Yes, it did.
However, he proudly told me that he "beat herpes."
I'm sorry, Donna.
I'm gonna go home.
I just found out Andy's getting married.

We were together for a really long time.
- All right.
- What?
What?
Listen, you are a hot, young doctor.

- Okay, I don't know you.
But I do know that you can fix your attitude.
Do you want to go home and feel sorry for yourself about a man you didn't want to marry?
Or do you want to go talk to that cute boy who has been looking at you and give him your number before I throw him in my Benz for myself?
All right.
I just want to thank my family, my friends, most importantly, my bebest man,
Mr. Tom Haverford.
Oh!
Coolest guy I know.
And, ladies, he's single, I think.
You're not still married, are you?
- No.
- But you... you're straight?
- Yes.
- Jean-Ralphio's just a friend?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
Anyways, oh, my God, I'm married!
This is crazy.

There's nothing in the world we can't accomplish if we try.
I have to go.
It's been great talking to you.
- Hey.
- Don't worry.
I'm not gonna say another word.
This is your day.
I just wanted to say that...
I'm really glad you're here.
I think you're awesome, and I love you.
Oh.
What's the deal with that hot girl, April?
- What's the deal with her?
- Yeah.
Like, she good to go?

She's married.

You should stay.
Don't go back to Indianapolis.
You should stay here.
- You think?
- Yeah.
Yes.
It's a great city here, you know?
And there are great people.
And you've made a lot of friends.
And what are you gonna do...
Go back to your old job and hack up people's budgets?
Stay here.
Help us build something.
I already accepted the job.
- I'm, uh...
I'm staying here.
- That's good.
Yeah, I think so.
- Orin's behind me, isn't he?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- So just keep your eyes on me.
- Okay.
Don't panic, 'cause he can smell fear.
Just keep talking to me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
How are you?
- How was the wedding...
- Run.
"Hope we can get together soon."
Okay, now you write, "Who is this?"
Ah.
Hey, you guys, we got a video from April and Andy.
- Oh.
Okay.
- Whoo!
Yeah!
How you guys doing?
- Hey, we're on our honeymoon.
- It is awesome.
We're at Burly's family vacation house on Lake Michigan.
We're having so much fun, except for, uh, Roberta here turns out sucks at water-skiing so bad.
I'm gonna divorce you.
Andy sucks at driving a boat.
And I'm gonna divorce him, probably right now.
Well, they're still together.
You owe me 20 bucks.
We're asking everyone to do street parking.

[Ron groans]
- You okay, Ron?
- Just a little tooth pain.
I'm fine.
Continue.
Okay, each department will be getting blue bins... [groans in pain]
Do you need to go to the dentist, Ron?
I don't like dentists.
Just a second.
- Hey.
- No, no.
No!
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!
[All shouting]
All:
Aah!
- Oh!
- What the [bleep]?
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, everybody.
What were we talking about...
Recycling?
Dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday.
But it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your co-workers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.
Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint.
[Chuckling]
[Triumphant music]
Attention, everybody!
Everybody, listen up.
You are all officially invited to a dinner party, 7:00 P.M. tonight at our home, which is officially my friend Burly's home, because I don't have a home.
That's it.
There's no more left.
Give it to him.
We've been dating for almost a month, so we just decided that we wanted to do something special.
And dinner parties do combine two of our favorite things... dinner and parties.
- Parties.
- Yeah.
It's like if you could have a Xbox pancake.
Your invitations include requests for each of you to bring stuff, 'cause we don't have a whole lot.
- Don't be late.
- Watch out. [Laughs]
"Dearest Tom, please bring silverware."
- "Please bring cooked steak."
- This is ridiculous.
They're young.
They're in love.
They're ready to show it to the world.
It's very sweet.
- And we're all going.
- What?
There's a boy's sale at Dillard's today.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
You going tonight?
Yeah.
Apparently they want me to bring Avatar and 50 pairs of 3-d glasses and a 3-d-capable television.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Well, I will see you there, with all of those things.
I was actually coming to see you.
I wanted your advice on something.
- Oh, yeah?
- My boss in Indianapolis...
He wants me back on the road in a week.
But then this morning Chris offered me a job to stay here in Pawnee and work for him.
- Do you want to do that?
- Well, I don't know.
I've been moving around so much the past few years, it might be nice to stay in one place for a while.
- What do you think?
- Well, this is a great city.
You know, it's definitely the best city in Indiana, probably America, possibly the world.
Sure.
But on the other hand, you've put in 12 years with the state government.
So you think I should say no to Chris and head back to Indianapolis or...?
It's a tough call.
You know what I would do?
You should make a pros and cons list.
- That always works for me.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, maybe I'll do that.
Excellent.
Nice talking to you.
- Good stuff.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So how does this work?
All right, you just fill out your name tag,
- and you're all set.
- Okay.
But I-I mean, do I just go up and talk to anyone, or do I wait for them to talk to me, or...?
Are you asking me how to flirt with men?
Okay.
All right.
It's a whole new Ann Perkins.
I'm putting myself out there, meeting some new people, having some casual fun, and it is...awkward.
Gayle went out and got me this new party shirt.
So be honest...
What do you guys think?
You know what, Jerry?
I make fun of you a lot, but credit where credit is due.
You know, I like how the...
[Laughing]
Damn it.
I was so close.
It's a terrible shirt.
Hey, guys.
Okay, everybody listen up.
April's friend Orin is here.
He's very intense and very weird.
So if you end up talking to him, just make sure you don't reveal anything personal about yourself.
- Hey, gang.
- Hey.
- What'd you bring?
- I was in charge of the cake.
To be fair, it's not a cake so much as it is a vegetable loaf.
You got your mushrooms, your alfalfa sprouts, your spinach, and I had it sweetened with fruit reduction.
But did they ask you to bring a vegetable loaf or a cake?
No, a cake, but this is so much healthier.
So not only does this thing exist, but now you have deprived everyone of cake.
- Take a walk, Ron.
- Yep.
Donna.
Oh, my God.
I am so excited to see you here.
These things are horrible when you're by yourself.
What?
Do you know where you are right now?
We're in the jungle.
There are no friends here.
It's every woman for herself.
- You're joking, right?
- Do I look like I'm joking?
Dating is a zero-sum game.
If you get a man, I don't get that man.
I'm here because of advice that you gave me to be more adventurous in my life.
Here's some more advice...
Beat it.
Hey.
Ben, heard you might be leaving Pawnee.
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.
Well, you are a huge nerd.
But I'd be sorry to see you go, man.
Thanks, Tom.
Okay, this party needs a little help.
I'll be right back.
So are you going on, like, a year-long walking tour of the set of The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand?
To be honest with you, I wasn't a fan of, uh, Peter Jackson's interpretation.
So you can put that one away.
Andy, I think you maybe should put some more food out.
Totally agree.
Just firing up the bagel bites now.
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.
What do you think?
April, you're not supposed to let me see you.
No, come on.
You have to look.
This is important.
You have to tell me if I look good.
Hey, guys, what's going on?
Uh, it's supposed to be a big surprise.
But tonight me and April are getting married...
To each other.
- Are you pregnant?
- Yes.
- Yes?
- No.
Are you sick?
Are you terminal?
Is it like that movie A Walk to Remember?
- Yes.
- What?
- No.
God.
- Oh, God.
Why are you doing this?
Why is this great thing happening?
Well, I mean, it's actually a really funny story.
We were hanging out.
And suddenly, I was like,
"What if we got married tomorrow?"
And she was like...
"Fine."
- [Softly] She's fine.
- That is a great story.
But you guys haven't been together very long, and you have no place to live.
We've been together long enough, and we'll find a place to live.
Yeah.
Like, a house or, like, a condo or something.
Probably a condo.
It's... you can't just get a condo.
No, you're right...
house.
I love Andy and April as a couple.
I want them to stay together forever.
But relationships need planning.
You just can't jump into something without thinking.
It took me four years to find the right hairdresser, and we still fight all the time!
Andy and April are gonna surprise people with a secret ceremony.
Whoa.
Secret wedding.
Julia Roberts pulled the same move.
Is that that toothy girl from Mystic Pizza?
Ron, please, I need you to help me knock some sense into them.
It's not really my place or yours.
- Hi.
I'm Ann.
- Brian.
What's your occupation?
I'm a manager at a sporting-goods store.
- No way.
Me too.
- Seriously?
Which one?
No, I'm not.
Um, I-I was just ribbing you.
- What are you drinking?
- [Laughs] Yeah.
- What?
- Oh, I don't know.
I-I couldn't hear you.
So you just laughed and said, "Yeah"?
- Yeah.
- Excuse us.
That was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
Did you grow up in the woods?
Are you Nell from the movie Nell?
I told you I'm rusty.
All right, come with me.
- Hey, Andy.
- Yeah.
I know what's going down, and I'm so happy for you guys.
Thank you, Tom.
Hey, something just occurred to me.
- Can I be your best man?
- Yeah, dude, totally.
- Thank you.
- My best man.
[Mouths words]
One of my life goals is to be a best man.
It's a baller position.
You get drunk.
You make speeches.
And you make love to the prettiest bridesmaid, usually standing from behind.
Look, I know that I cannot tell you what to do.
I know it doesn't work...
From all the times I've tried to tell you what to do before.
But you know what would be fun?
Maybe we should make a pros and cons list.
Let me take you home, and then we'll go do that together.
It'll be a blast.
- Leslie, relax.
- You relax.
You relax all the way home and get into bed.
- You need to go to bed.
- April.
Girl talk.
Hey, uh, what's your middle name?
The justice of the peace lady needs to know.
You don't know each other's middle names?
I don't want to say it out loud.
- [Laughs] Ew!
- Shut up.
- [Laughing] Roberta!
- Such a loser.
- Can't believe I'm marrying him.
- You don't have to.
I'm going to.
And then I'm gonna divorce him.
Then I'm gonna marry him again.
One time, I fell madly in love with a Civil War reenactor that I had only known for six hours.
And then I found out he wore those clothes all the time.
And he was married.
But the clothes thing really bothered me.
You always want to scribble the name.
Make them read.
Draw them in.
- Make them work for it.
- Right.
Two shots of Jameson.
Don't make too much eye contact.
You want to seem available, but not too available.
Oh, thanks.
I think I'm good for now.
- I'm not gonna...
- Yeah.
All right...
Let's do this.
Ron, you are so amazing with me and April, stuff.
I love you, man.
Would you be one of my best men?
I'd be honored to, son.
Chris, you helped me get April back.
Would you be my best man?
Nothing else in my entire life would make me happier as long as I live.
Jerry.
Ah, I'm so glad you made it.
This shirt is hilarious.
Derek and Ben, will you be my best men?
Got a little competition for the best man, huh?
Well, you know what the best best man does.
Excuse me!
Are there any strippers here?
Former strippers?
Non-dancers but you're feeling a little bit drunk?
What are you doing?
I'm throwing Andy an impromptu bachelor party.
It's my duty as best man.
The wedding's in four minutes.
It's that kind of negative thinking that makes you a less good best man.
[Cell phone rings] Hello?
Hi, Ann, it's Leslie...
Leslie Knope from the Parks Department.
Yeah, I know.
Where are you?
April and Andy are getting married tonight.
- What?
- Yeah, I know.
I need you to get down here, Ann.
I need you to kiss him again or kiss her or kiss somebody.
I don't know, Ann!
Help me, please!
Relationships are like scuba diving.
If you come up too fast, you get the bends.
And the reason why I know this is because I was dating a guy once, and we were scuba diving, and I told him that I loved him underwater, and he shot up really fast, and he got the bends.
No, Orin, I don't know how I'm going to die.
Wait.
Are you asking me or telling me?
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yes, please.
April and Andy are about to get married.
Wow.
My Brita filter is older than their relationship.
Wait a second.
Should I change my Brita filter?
I don't know.
It depends on how frequently you use it.
- It's true.
- Stay focused, okay?
Please.
The point is two boneheads whom I love dearly are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through.
And nobody seems concerned about this.
Attention, everybody.
Madames and...
Mis...
Wahs.
If you would do me the obligation of having your honor heretofore in the room doth right over there, uh, hence.
What?
Big event in that room, 15 minutes.
Oh, my God.
This is really happening.
I love April and Andy.
I want them to stay together.
And that is why I have to stop their wedding.
Remember how I told you there was going to be a surprise later?
Well, the surprise is you're not actually at a dinner party.
You're at our wedding.
[Applause]
All right.
Uh, let's do this.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to marry Andrew Maxwell Dwyer and April Roberta Ludgate.
I guess I kind of hate most things.
But I never really seem to hate you.
So I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
- Is that cool?
- Yes.
[Paper shuffling]
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.
"April, you're the most awesome person I have ever known
"in my entire life.
"I vow to protect you from danger.
"And I don't care if I have to fight
"an ultimate fighter or a bear or him,
"your mom...
I would take them down."
Andy.
I'm getting mad right now even thinking about it.
- I'm telling you.
- It's okay.
I want to spend the rest of my life... every minute...
with you.
And I'm the luckiest man in the galaxy.

You wouldn't have been able to stop it, you know.
I could've yelled something or tackled someone.
But you didn't, because deep down, you knew it wouldn't have mattered.
Those kids are gonna do what they want to do.
They may have just ruined their lives on an impulse decision.
Leslie, I got married twice.
Both times, I was a lot older than those two.
And both marriages ended in divorce...
And a burning effigy.
Who's to say what works?
You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice.
That's all anybody can do.
Wait.
Weren't you married three times?
Oh, my God, you're right.
[Chuckles]
I get to burn another effigy.
The key to burning an ex-wife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol...
From a safe distance.
Do not stand too close when you light an ex-wife effigy.
My sister is lame, but Andy's sort of cool.
I guess I kind of see why he'd marry her.
Also, if anyone finds my gray hoodie, I lost it.
Thanks.
[Applause]
That was beautiful.
You two remind me of me and my husband, George.
I got to nail the speech.
So I brought in an expert...
Jean-Ralphio.
Can I throw something on you, see if it feels good?
Sure.
Okay, this is what I would do.
I would start with a joke.
Joke, Vince Vaughn quote, obviously.

Fred Claus.
Talk about Andy's ex-girlfriends.

Hold back your tears.
Pause.
Drop the microphone.
Get out of that bitch.
[Imitates explosion]
I wish you the best of luck, to both of you.
Aw, thank you, grandma.
How can anyone ever possibly top that?
Am I right?
So thank you all for all the talking.
Let's just get back to dancing, huh?
[Cheers and applause]
Cool.
See you around maybe.
- That went better, right?
- Yes, it did.
However, he proudly told me that he "beat herpes."
I'm sorry, Donna.
I'm gonna go home.
I just found out Andy's getting married.
- So?
- So that's my ex-boyfriend.
We were together for a really long time.
- All right.
- What?
What?
Listen, you are a hot, young doctor.
- I'm a nurse, actually.
- Okay, I don't know you.
But I do know that you can fix your attitude.
Do you want to go home and feel sorry for yourself about a man you didn't want to marry?
Or do you want to go talk to that cute boy who has been looking at you and give him your number before I throw him in my Benz for myself?
All right.
I just want to thank my family, my friends, most importantly, my bebest man,
Mr. Tom Haverford.
Oh!
Coolest guy I know.
And, ladies, he's single, I think.
You're not still married, are you?
- No.

- Yeah!
Anyways, oh, my God, I'm married!
This is crazy.
What happened?
But, seriously, life is short, right?
Uh, just...
I really think you should just do whatever makes you happy.
That's what April and I did.
We are in love.
So we didn't overthink it.
I mean, seriously, I cannot emphasize how little we thought about this.

Look, I know that I cannot tell you what to do.
I know it doesn't work, from all the times I've tried to tell you what to do before.
But you know what would be fun?
Maybe we should make a pros and cons list.
Let me take you home, and then we'll go do that together.
It'll be a blast.
Leslie, relax.
You relax.
You relax all the way home and get into bed.
You need to go to bed.
April.
Girl talk.
Hey, what's your middle name?
The justice of the peace lady needs to know.
You don't know each other's middle names?
I don't wanna say it out loud.
(WHISPERS)
(ANDY LAUGHS)
ANDY:
Ew.
APRIL:
Shut up.
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Roberta!
Such a loser.
Can't believe I'm marrying him.
You don't have to.
I'm going to.
And then I'm gonna divorce him.
Then I'm gonna marry him again.
One time, I fell madly in love with a Civil War reenactor that I had only known for six hours.
And then I found out he wore those clothes all the time.
And he was married.
But the clothes thing really bothered me.
You always wanna scribble the name.
Make 'em read.
Draw them in.
Make 'em work for it.
Right.
Two shots of Jameson.
Don't make too much eye contact.
You wanna seem available, but not too available.
Oh, thanks.
I think I'm good for now.
I'm not gonna...
Yeah.
All right.
Let's do this.
Ron, you are so amazing with me and April, stuff.
I love you, man.
Would you be one of my best men?
I'd be honored to, son.
Chris, you helped me get April back.
Would you be my best man?
Nothing else in my entire life would make me happier as long as I live.
Jerry.
I'm so glad you made it.
This shirt is hilarious.
Derek and Ben, will you be my best men?
Got a little competition for the best man, huh?
Well, you know what the best best man does.
Excuse me!
Are there any strippers here?
Former strippers?
Non-dancers but you're feeling a little bit drunk?
What are you doing?
I'm throwing Andy an impromptu bachelor party.
It's my duty as best man.
The wedding's in four minutes.
It's that kind of negative thinking that makes you a less good best man.
(CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello?
Hi, Ann, it's Leslie,
Leslie Knope from the Parks Department.
Yeah, I know.
Where are you?
April and Andy are getting married tonight.
What?
Yeah, I know.
I need you to get down here, Ann.
I need you to kiss him again or kiss her or kiss somebody.
I don't know, Ann!
Help me, please!
Relationships are like scuba diving.
If you come up too fast, you get the bends.
And the reason why I know this is because I was dating a guy once, and we were scuba diving, and I told him that I loved him underwater, and he shot up really fast, and he got the bends.
No, Orin, I don't know how I'm going to die.
Wait.
Are you asking me or telling me?
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yes, please.
April and Andy are about to get married.
Wow.
My Brita filter's older than their relationship.
Wait a second.
Should I change my Brita filter?
I don't know.
It depends on how frequently you use it.
True.
Stay focused, okay?
Please.
The point is two boneheads, whom I love dearly, are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through.
And nobody seems concerned about this.
ANDY:
Attention, everybody.
Mesdames and...
Missoirs.
If you would do me the obligation of having your honor, heretofore, in the room doth right over there, hence.
What?
Big event in that room, 15 minutes.
Oh, my God.
This is really happening.
I love April and Andy.
I want them to stay together.
And that is why I have to stop their wedding.
ANDY:
Hi, guys, remember how I told you there was going to be a surprise later?
Well, the surprise is you are not actually at a dinner party.
You're at our wedding.
(ALL APPLAUDING)
ANDY:
All right.
Let's do this.
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:
Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to marry Andrew Maxwell Dwyer and April Roberta Ludgate.
I guess I kind of hate most things.
But I never really seem to hate you.
So, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
Is that cool?
Yes.
Is it my turn?
Yes.
"April, you're the most awesome person
"I have ever known in my entire life.
"I vow to protect you from danger.
"I don't care if I have to fight
"an ultimate fighter, or a bear, or him,
"your mom...
I would take 'em down."
APRIL:
Andy.
I'm getting mad right now even thinking about it.
I'm telling you.
It's okay.
I wanna spend the rest of my life, every minute, with you.
And I'm the luckiest man in the galaxy.
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:
And now the rings.
By the power vested in me by the State of Indiana,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
BRETT:
Go fly away.
Fly!
Fly!
Wings of love.
(ALL GASPING)
BRETT:
Okay.
All right.
So that one is dead.
We know that.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
You wouldn't have been able to stop it, you know.
I could've yelled something or tackled someone.
But you didn't, because deep down, you knew it wouldn't have mattered.
Those kids are gonna do what they wanna do.
They may have just ruined their lives on an impulse decision.
Leslie, I got married twice.
Both times, I was a lot older than those two.
And both marriages ended in divorce...
And a burning effigy.
Who's to say what works?
You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice.
That's all anybody can do.
Wait.
Weren't you married three times?
Oh, my God, you're right.
(LAUGHS)
I get to burn another effigy.
The key to burning an ex-wife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol from a safe distance.
Do not stand too close when you light an ex-wife effigy.
My sister is lame, but Andy's sort of cool.
I guess I kind of see why he'd marry her.
Also, if anyone finds my gray hoodie, I lost it.
Thanks.
(ALL APPLAUDING)
That was beautiful.
You two remind me of me and my husband, George.
TOM:
I gotta nail the speech.
So I brought in an expert.
Jean-Ralphio.
Can I throw something on you, see if it feels good?
Sure.
Okay, this is what I would do.
I would start with a joke.
Joke, Vince Vaughn quote, obviously.
Swingers or Crashers?
Fred Claus.
Talk about Andy's ex-girlfriends.
Quote from Love Actually.
Hold back your tears.
Pause.
Drop the microphone.
Get out of that bitch. (MIMICS EXPLOSION)
I wish you the best of luck, to both of you.
ANDY:
Thank you, Grandma.
How could anyone ever possibly top that?
Am I right?
So, thank you all for all the talking.
Let's just get back to dancing, huh?
(ALL CHEERING)
Cool.
See you around, maybe.
That went better, right?
Yes, it did.
However, he proudly told me that he "beat herpes."
I'm sorry, Donna.
I'm gonna go home.
I just found out Andy's getting married.
So?
So that's my ex-boyfriend.
We were together for a really long time.
All right.
What?
What?
Listen, you are a hot, young doctor.
I'm a nurse, actually.
Okay, I don't know you.
But I do know that you can fix your attitude.
Do you wanna go home and feel sorry for yourself about a man you didn't wanna marry?
Or do you wanna go talk to that cute boy, who has been looking at you, and give him your number before I throw him in my Benz for myself?
All right.
ANDY:
I just wanna thank my family, my friends, most importantly, my best best man, Mr. Tom Haverford.
Oh!
Coolest guy I know.
And, ladies, he's single, I think.
You're not still married, are you?
No.
But you...
You're straight?
Yes.
Jean-Ralphio's just a friend?
Yeah.
Yeah!
Anyways, oh, my God, I'm married!
(LAUGHS) This is crazy.
What happened?
But, seriously, life is short, right?
Uh, just...
I really think you should just do whatever makes you happy.
That's what April and I did.
We are in love.
So we didn't overthink it.
I mean, seriously, I cannot emphasize how little we thought about this.
Am I right?
All right, well, this is a song I wrote for you,
April Roberta Ludgate.
I love you.
(MOUTHING) I love you.
(SINGING) Yeah, yeah
Oh, Grandma
April, there's so little time
The things I really want to do
Let's fly to the sky
It's so awesome
Exactly.
Mortality.
See, I like to take each day at a time.
There's nothing in the world we can't accomplish if we try.
I have to go.
It's been great talking to you.
Hey.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna say another word.
This is your day.
I just wanted to say that...
I'm really glad you're here.
I think you're awesome, and I love you.
What's the deal with that hot girl, April?
BEN:
What's the deal with her?
Yeah.
Like, is she good to go?
Like, is she down to clown?
She's married.
She got married, like, 20 minutes ago.
Oh, my God.
That's the same girl from the thing.
From the wedding ceremony, yeah.
All the good ones are taken, huh, bro?
Yeah.
Hey.
You should stay.
Don't go back to Indianapolis.
You should stay here.
You think?
Yeah.
Yes.
It's a great city here, you know?
And there are great people.
And you've made a lot of friends.
And what are you gonna do?
You gonna go back to your old job and hack up people's budgets?
Stay here.
Help us build something.
I already accepted the job.
I'm staying here.
That's good.
Yeah, I think so.
Orin's behind me, isn't he?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
So just keep your eyes on me.
Okay.
Don't panic, 'cause he can smell fear.
What do I...
Just keep talking to me.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
How was the wedding?
Run!
ANN: " Hey, Ann, it was great talking to you last night.
"Hope we can get together soon."
Okay, now you write, "Who is this?"
Hey, you guys, we got a video from April and Andy.
Oh.
Okay.
How you guys doing?
Hey, we're on our honeymoon.
It is awesome.
We're at Burly's family vacation house on Lake Michigan.
We're having so much fun.
Except for Roberta, here, turns out, sucks at water skiing.
Oh, my God.
So bad.
I'm gonna divorce you.
Andy sucks at driving a boat.
And I'm gonna divorce him, probably right now.
Well, they're still together.
You owe me 20 bucks.
Previously on The Hard Times of RJ Berger...
- Morning, Berger.
- Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?
RJ, is that any way to treat a guest?
Are you asking me out on a date?
Yes, I am.
I suppose you're here to tell me... to stay away from your mother.
You suppose correctly.
And if I don't?
Then, Mr. Sinclair...
Life becomes extraordinarily difficult for you.
A threat.
A promise.
There are quite a few secrets rattling around that skull of yours.
Secrets that the school board or your parole officer... might find rather interesting.
With all due respect, Mr. Sinclair, you have no choice but to obey.
With all due respect, Mr. Berger, you can kiss my black ass.
What the...
No, no, no, not yet!
Damn it, Miles.
You pulled me out too soon!
I had him!
Five minutes.
Not a second more.
Those were your instructions.
I had him.
Look at you, man.
You're coming apart at the seams.
If I wanted a sermon, I'd go to church.
Have you been cooking bacon?
Miles, what the hell were you doing?
The only thing that'll make you see the light.
Ugh!
Wakey, wakey.
Eggs and bac-y.
Your mama made us breakfast.
My name is RJ Berger.
And every morning I wake up to the same nightmare.
Mm, deeeelicious.
Deeelighted to hear it.
Well, I'm ghost.
Gotta let the golf team in... for their morning workout.
Want a ride to school, son?
No, I'll...
I'll take the bus.
This is, um, surreal enough already.
Eh, suit yourself.
I'll see you later.
Mm, hmm-hmm-hmm.
Mm!
Damn!
Yeah.
Whoo.
Mm.
- RJ, honey, we have to talk.
- I agree.
Should I change the locks, or should you?
What, Jeriba?
Oh, no, honey.
Don't worry about him.
He's just a warm body to fill the void.
No, it's that tomorrow... is your daddy's and my 20th anniversary.
Oh.
So I was hoping you could be here in the evening.
Okay, what for?
So mommy doesn't have to be alone with the sad monsters... that live inside her heart.
Why can't he hang with you?
RJ, we've discussed this.
He can't do Friday nights.
- Community service.
- Community service.
It'll be fun.
We'll order Armenian and play pictionary.
But mostly we'll just...
Not cry.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Have you ever hit pause when the Asian guy's naked... in the hangover?
I mean, that's gotta be the world's smallest penis.
- Miles, I...
- Dude, seriously.
You can't even see it through the pubes.
My life is falling apart, and this is what you wanna talk about?
If you were a superhero, that little Asian guy... would be your arch-Nemesis.
He'd be the ying to your wang.
Let me see your hand.
- What?
- Let me see your hand.
How long it take you to write that?
All morning.
Damn, girl.
If you didn't already have a limp,
I would give you one.
I am gonna hump... your overdeveloped brains out your skull.
Mm!
Ugh.
Unbelievable.
Robo-troll has a boyfriend.
I can't even buy a second look from a blind girl.
That's it, man.
I'm gettin' in shape.
Miles, you do this every couple of weeks.
You say you're gonna get in shape.
You go home.
You jog half a mile.
You vomit.
And then you spend the rest of the afternoon... writing jokes on your hands.
Look, I love you, buddy.
But you have the self-control... of Lindsay Lohan's nostrils.
No, I'm serious.
I'm gonna get in shape this time.
I'm gettin' in shape.
RJ, you...
Got a minute?
Okay.
Whew.
Is everything okay?
Uh, not really.
But, hey, I got my first paycheck... as a substitute teacher.
Although after taxes and a week's rent, it comes to 23 bucks.
Although you'd be surprised at how far that goes... at 7-11.
- I gotta get to class.
- Right.
RJ, I was just wondering if, uh, if you were free to spend a little time... with your old man tomorrow night.
Oh, actually, I've...
I've already made...
It's just that I don't trust myself to be alone... on my first anniversary away from mommy.
I'll be honest, son.
$18.50 of that $23 went to five bottles of red wine.
Right now they're the only, uh, company I've got.
Yeah, dad.
Of course I'll...
All right!
Oh, thank you so much!
Oh, you have made a sad, sad man... just a tiny, tiny bit less sad.
This is gonna be great.
Now, I'll...
I'll fire up the hot plate, and I'll whip up some Franks, and I've got this little doohickey from radio shack... that lets you hook up a vcr to a tv, so we can watch our favorite tape together,
just like old times.
Miles...
I need you to come hold me.
Oh, you're so strong.
Being a male cheerleader... is like having McDonald's and burger king... all at once, Miles.
First you see the golden arches.
Then you have it your way.
Oh, Miles!
That's amazing.
Hands off, bitch!
He's mine!
Uh-uh, girl.
He's mine!
Whoa, whoa.
Easy.
There's plenty to go around.
God gave me ten fingers.
Keep your hands off him.
Gonna get what I want.
Yeah, baby!
Spirit fingers.
So great, instead of one clinically depressed parent,
I get both of them.
Guess if I leave my mom's early enough,
I can make it over to my dad... before he weeps his way through our old vacation photos.
I'm telling you, as a veteran of divorce, these things never end well.
Yeah, I know, but what am I supposed to do?
I can't let them both down.
Are you kidding me?
They let you down.
Listen, RJ, I know what you're going through.
Believe me.
And I know how tempting it is... to play the nice guy.
But you have to stop trying to please everybody else... and start taking care of yourself.
Your parents are grown-ups.
- Not really.
- Okay, well, maybe not.
But I do know that it is their job... to take care of you, and not the other way around.
So are you still planning on doing this alone?
Well, I-I don't really think I have another choice.
Well, I could maybe go with you... for moral support.
You are aware that my mom and coach are...
Crazy.
And completely self-absorbed and psycho.
Yeah, I totally know that.
But that is divorce, RJ.
My parents went through the same thing.
Except, actually, it was my dad that left for a black guy.
Yeah.
The point is, sometimes everybody needs... a little support.
So my mom's apartment, 6:30.
It's a date.
Stop, stop, stop!
What was that?
Um, Robin, what are you guys doing?
What does it look like we're doing?
We're practicing?
I'm team captain.
I lead practice.
Well, you were late.
And we got tired of waiting.
- Oh, really.
- Hey!
What the hell?
'Sup, chicken heads?
Anybody need a lift?
Morning, bud.
Hey, dad.
Can we talk about something?
Look what I've got.
Sir homie, the brown knight?
No way!
It's one of the few things your mom sent me... that I didn't burn.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
Uh, hey, about tonight.
Hey, look, I gotta tell ya.
If I didn't have this to look forward to, if I didn't have you to depend on,
I-I might die of a broken heart.
- Dad, don't say that.
- No, no, it's true.
And someday I'm gonna go to Israel... and plant a tree in your name... because you saved a life today.
No, well, listen to me babble on.
Um, you were gonna say something, sorry.
Go ahead.
I was going to say...
I have something to do earlier in the evening, so I was kinda hoping we could meet up... a little later on.
Oh, so when you say something, you really mean someone, huh?
Huh?
- Uh...
- Yeah?
Someone.
Attaboy!
Sure, we can meet later.
Absolutely.
So in other words, you pussed out.
He was desperate, Miles.
What else was I supposed to do?
Wait, wait a second.
So y'all mean to tell me I'm the only one here... whose parents are happily married?
170 iq with a stable, upper-middle class home life.
Ha!
Who's your stereotype now, homie?
Well, you are dating a white girl with a huge ass.
True.
If I were you, I'd call his bluff.
I mean, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Uh, I don't know.
I mean, he could kill himself.
Bingo.
And you got a spare dad waiting in the wings.
Miles, I don't want coach to be my dad.
I don't even want him to be my coach.
All I'm saying is give the guy a chance.
He's friends with pimps.
- Mm.
- Wow.
Another selfless act of friendship.
You know, you'd be a lot cuter if you didn't talk.
Oh, and you'd be a lot smarter.
Ooh.
I like this girl more every day.
Me, too.
Well, I think it's time for me to get... to cheerleading practice.
I am gonna have McDonald's... and burger king today.
And how is that different from any other day?
Ohhh!
- Ohhh!
- Hey!
Well played, baby.
Jeriba.
Hey, Rick.
Ohhh.
How's it hangin'?
Oh, you know.
Alone.
Big plans for this weekend?
- Me?
- Yeah.
Nah.
Not a damn thing.
Well, unless you count leaving' my mark... on some fine white ass.
And you?
Oh, actually, I'm getting together... with RJ tonight.
Gonna have some old-fashioned father-son bonding.
Is that so?
Mm-hmm.
Good luck with that.
Oh, my God.
I'm doing it!
Ready to come down?
Yeah.
One, two... ah.
- Whoo!
- Yes!
Shut up and do it again.
Okay.
Oh, no, wait, wait.
Whoa, everybody stop.
What the hell, Meredith?
I have girl cramps.
Like I care!
Get over there and do it again!
Maybe we should let her take a break.
Maybe you should let me instill some discipline... in these girls, since you're obviously not capable.
Meredith, do it again.
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Oh.
Cheerleading rocks.
Heh, heh, heh.
Agh, blood!
Ohhhhh!
Oh, my God.
Dude, it's just blood.
Just blood?
Period blood isn't just...
Period blood isn't just blood.
Period blood is what the devil makes terrorists drink in hell.
Yeah, well, you're gonna give yourself a blister.
Who cares?
I probably need a full face transplant!
Damn it!
Why can't anything just go right for me?
- Come on, Miles.
- Seriously!
I just wanted to lose some weight... to get girls to like me.
Now I'm gonna be hearing vampire jokes... the rest of my life.
Miles.
Buddy, come on.
When a girl likes you...
For real, likes you...
It's not because you're skinny or attractive... or chiseled.
It's because you're you.
You're funny, you're cool, you're sincere.
The kind of guy who spends an entire morning... writing jokes on his hand to make his buddy laugh.
Look.
I know this is supposed to be a nice friendship moment.
And don't get me wrong.
I really appreciate it, man.
I really do.
But, uh,
I had a girl's period blood on my face.
Yeah, we should get back to scrubbing.
Put some elbow grease in it.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Lift, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
You call that a lift, bitch tits?
Stop shaking!
I can't help it.
My goggles are so fogged up, I can't see anything.
I know it's hard lifting that cow up in the air, but we don't want to drop her, do we?
Keep it up, girls.
One, two, three, four.
Five, six...
Ow, that hurt!
Are you serious?
Oh, no.
Are you hurt, Jenny?
My ankle.
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
Practice isn't over.
I'm taking her to the nurse, you psycho hose beast.
You do that, and you're both off the squad for good!
Oh, I'm really gonna miss the period blood... all over my face!
Oh!
You're finished, Swanson!
God.
Back to one!
What are you looking at?
Mmm, look at that, huh?
Oh, that meat looks fantastic.
Yeah, wait till you see the real thing later.
Mom.
Surprise, mother[Bleep]!
I thought you had...
What, community service?
Yeah, I know.
I slipped a crack head five bucks... to clean that synagogue for me.
'Sides, I thought it'd be a good idea... if we spent some quality time together.
You know, some family time.
Aren't you just the sweetest thing?
Oh, I just wanna ungh!
So, RJ, why don't you and, um...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, mom, coach, this is Amy.
- Amy.
- Hi.
So you're the older woman Rj's been telling us about.
You are just as cute as a button.
And I can see what RJ meant when he said... you have the curves of a video vixen.
What?
No, I'm...
I never said that.
- Uh, no, that was me.
- Oh, that was him.
Mm-hmm.
Coach Sinclair.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
You can call me Jeriba.
Okay.
Mm, okay.
Have a seat.
I, uh, cooked up some of papa Sinclair's... famous skirt steak... and bought a few bottles of the good stuff... to go with it.
And RJ, if it's okay with your mama, you and Amy can drink as much as you want.
Yeah, a few sips.
Let's pretend we're French for the evening.
Then the cop looked me dead in the eye, put down his flashlight, and said, "you sucked how many?"...
Honestly, that story gets funnier... every time I hear it.
Oh, God.
Oh.
You don't know how I feel.
I can't believe it!
I'm...
In...
Oh, these are tears I don't mind crying.
Tears of laughter.
Yeah, laughter and camaraderie.
Ah, cin-cin.
Yahhhhh!
We're sorry.
Your cellular account has been suspended... due to nonpayment.
To speak...
Hey, keep it down!
Ow.
I love that I just, like, caught RJ... eating his own poopy.
- Mom, enough.
- You ate your own poop?
- Oh, that ain't right.
- It was Thanksgiving.
You know, I think my little gobbler... just wanted a pre-Turkey snack.
- Okay, mom.
- Goddamn, son.
Well, remind me never to kiss you again.
I honestly thought it was pumpkin pie.
But what are you gonna do?
11-year-olds, you know?
- Uh, you were 11?
- It was a bad year.
It was.
It was a bad year.
Well, it's getting kinda late.
Um, we should be...
Opening up another bottle.
I completely agree.
Pray tell, what strange manner of dress is this?
Oh, snap!
I done ended up in olden times.
Hey, quit it!
No!
I'll get it.
If that's the neighbor telling us to keep it down,
I'll kick...
I'll kick his damn ass!
I bet you will.
Dad.
- I counted on you, RJ.
- Son of a bitch.
I counted on you, and you weren't there for me.
Good evening, Amy.
Hi, Mr. Berger.
- Jeriba.
- Mm.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
You're drunk, Rick.
- Ohhh.
- Now, honey.
You're pretty [bleep]ed up yourself.
Jeriba, please.
Dad, I understand that you're mad.
I'm not mad.
I'm just...
Broken-hearted.
Dad, I'll go with you right now, and we'll watch the movie.
Don't bother.
You have a new brown knight now.
Hey!
That's some racist bull[bleep] right there, Berger.
Dad, it's not like that.
Mm.
Enjoy each other.

- So, uh, why so busy?
- Um,
I have to plan a wedding in two weeks.
Why so fast?
Are you...?
- Yeah.
- Pregnant!
No!
What?
No!
- No...
I'm getting married very quickly.
- Because you're pregnant.
- No.
- Oh, come on, you can tell me.
I won't judge.
Rose, trust me,
I am not pregnant.
Oh, good!
'Cause I was really disappointed in you.
Come on.
If you need to get married in a hurry, we have lots of books that can help.
Great.
"Wedding Bells and Baby Bonnets".
"Evening Service, Morning Sickness".
"From Prenup to Prenatal".
Rose, these are all for pregnant brides.
Oh, I guess they are.
But then, why else would anyone plan a wedding in two weeks?
Unless they're out of their minds.
Huh...
I'm beginning to think you're right.
Hey, buddy.
What's up?
Well, my computer crashed while I was writing a Islamic Assist...
You know what?
I don't have time.
- I don't have time to hang.
- Oh, no, no,
I don't want to hang, I...
I'm on official business.
Yeah, me too, so if you don't mind...
Sources say that Rayyan has finally pinned you down to a wedding date.
Confirm or deny.
Yeah, Saturday after next.
Bye.
Invitation accepted.
Now, my top secret sources tell me that Fatima says there's going to be a big wedding.
- Nothing's been decided yet.
- Word of warning:
my fat cousin Noah had over 400 guests.
He fell off the chair during the hora and crushed five kids.
My wedding will not have a hora.
A wedding without a hora?
Might as well not even have a rabbi.
Is this really for an article?
Naw, I just want to hang.
Bye.
There's the release form.
Now make the bad men go away.
In a jiffy.
One quick phone call and your problems will be gone faster than a bowl of gulab jamun at Auntie Nina's.
I have no idea what that means.
You want the Muslim menace
- to solve your tax problem?
- Yeah.
- Good luck with that.
- Thanks, I think he'll...
Uh, wait a minute.
That sounds...
ominous.
It is!
Thanks to Captain Curry,
I've been audited every year since I used him.
What?
Audited?
- Yeah.
- Sounds painful.
- Baber Siddiqui representing...
- Uh-h-h-h...
Sorry!
Wrong number.
Hanging up now.
- What are you doing?
- Just this.
You're, uh...
you're fired.
I should have known better than to trust whitey again.
Tsk!
Wow...
I feel kind of bad.
Well, it's 'cause he called you whitey.
Racism hurts.
I'm so excited you finally set a date!
Tell me everything.
Um, well, that's pretty much it.
We just decided this morning.
Details!
What have you booked?
The hall?
Flowers?
Menu?
Guests?
All important things that we have not done yet.
Yeah, we've just been so busy.
You've only got two weeks!
Well, I guess if we had to, we could postpone it until Yasir's next visit.
What?
No way!
I want to be married to you yesterday.
Then you need to plan it last week.
If you don't have time, then hire a professional who does.
Like a wedding planner?
Or your mother.
You want to plan our wedding?
I thought you'd never ask.
We didn't.
Okay, I'll do it.
Come on, let's get right down to it.
You had those ready to go,
- didn't you?
- Maybe.
Hey, uh, thanks for the tip about Baber.
I never would have known.
Oh, no sweat, Rev, hmm?
You know, there's nothing worse than an incompetent accountant, heh.
What are you talking about?
He's a terrific accountant.
A tad too honest for my taste.
- What?
- Well, you know, I assumed he'd be all Muslim-y and shady.
You know, like those guys from Hamas
- who fudge the numbers.
- Yeah?
Instead, he kept jabbering on and on about honesty and integrity.
So, you don't want an honest accountant?
Heck no.
That's the last thing you want from the guy doing your taxes.
No, an honest accountant is the first thing I want!
You?
Honest?
Yeah.
You lie all the time.
Well, uh, look, Fred, it's one thing to lie to a child or steal yarn from a kitten, but this is the government.
Scaredy-boy.
Maybe you and Baber are a match made in Muslim heaven.
Enjoy your virgins.
W- what are you talking about?
Honest Ahab made me declare all my income, every last dime.
And then he wouldn't let me write off my inflatable pool.
Well, you can't write off your pool!
You sound just like Baber.
So you wanted Baber to cheat on your taxes and he wouldn't let you?
Exactly.
So I fired him.
By the fishy beard of Jonah, what have I done?
Baber Siddiqui!
Just the man I'm looking for.
Oh, what, to belittle and deride me in front of the entire world?
No.
Look, I thought it over and I made a big mistake.
Oh!
I see, you made a mistake.
An honest mistake.
Could happen to anyone.
- Exactly!
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
Of course, and now you need my help.
- Yes.
- I see.
So, you're crawling on your belly back to me, begging for my help?
- Mm... yes.
- So even though it is humbling and humiliating for you, you are begging me, like a dirty little beggar, to help you out in this, your hour of need.
Yes.
I understand.
Yeah, see?
No!
No bloody way, you muddy little beggar pirate!
Uh, pirate?
- What...?
- Now it is your turn to choke on the pride that you swallowed.
After you took the best of what I had and then just threw me away like a piece of wet garbage!
I...
I don't think it went down quite like that.
Oh, that is exactly how it went downwards,
Mr. Use Once Then Throw Away!
Couldn't I just use you twice and then throw you away?
Uh, no, sir,
I'm not arguing with you.
I would...
I would never cross a member of the, uh, the tax department.
I just wanted to assure you that I'm not some kind of a... a tax cheat, you know?
No, I...
I know you didn't call me a tax cheat.
I called me a tax cheat.
I mean, no, I'm not...
I'm not implying that I am a tax cheat, I...
I don't know, I...
I don't know why I said tax cheat.
I'm, uh...
I'm a bit nervous and, uh, I can't stop saying tax cheat.
Tax cheat!
Tax cheat!
Yes, I'm a tax cheat!
Come get me!
What?
I look forward to your visit, sir.
Sarah:
Go on in, sit down and I'll show you what I've done so far.
Oh, you made headway already?
- Oh.
- I'm so glad you stepped in.
Yeah, me, too.
Thanks, Mom.
You hold your applause till I show you what I've done.
Now, close your eyes.
But I can't see with my eyes closed.
I want you to do some visualizations first.
Oh.
Visualize the most perfect day ever.
Your wedding day.
Now picture...
Oh, you're right.
Open your eyes.
- That was fast.
- Oh, I know.
I'm so excited, I can't wait any longer.
Um, what's this?
It's a limo service from Regina.
I have booked the biggest limo they have.
It holds 15 people.
But there's just two of us.
Well, you can use the extra space to relax in or enjoy the hot tub.
We need a hot tub?
Where is your sense of occasion?
Oh, speaking of which, how many doves do you want, 50 or 100?
100 doves?
Perfect.
Why skimp?
It's more tasteful than setting off fireworks.
- Or is it?
- I didn't know fireworks were on the table.
Oh, whoops!
The florist.
I've got to take this.
Hey, Tom.
Yeah, oh...
Um, how many rose petals do we need to line the sidewalk from the Mosque to the street?
- Uhh...
- Uhh...
Never mind, I'll ask Tom.
I'm going to need petals and I'm going to need lots of them!
What have we done?
Handed our wedding over to a crazy person!
Good morning, Rev.
Amaar!
Join me for some eggs Florentine.
Uh... no thanks.
Coffee's fine.
This whole wedding circus
- is killing my appetite.
- Wedding circus?
That sounds like fun.
Dancing bears, trapeze artists.
Someone inevitably saying,
"I never thought she'd marry this clown. "
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, I'm still kind of asleep.
You were saying?
Well, Rayyan and I have been so busy with work that, uh, Sarah's taken over the wedding.
Oh, nice!
A sucker to do all the dirty work.
Well, no, the problem is, it doesn't feel like us, but how do we say something without hurting Sarah?
Come on, how bad could it be?
Limos, rose petals, and doves.
Oh my.
I had no idea Muslim weddings could be like normal weddings.
They can be.
But you know, me being the imam,
I'm sure the community wants something a little more traditionally Islamic.
Sounds dreadful ly exciting.
Yes.
But how do doves and stretch limos fit in with Islam?
They don't.
Which is why I can tell Sarah to cancel them without hurting her feelings.
- Mm-hmm.
- Ha-ha!
You know what?
My appetite is back.
Dig in, I would love the company.
This might be my last meal before I'm carted off to debtor's prison.
I imagine this is how my Lord felt.
Having troubles?
Not just troubles, tax troubles.
Ooh.
Why don't you, uh, hire Baber?
Two steps ahead of you, my friend.
I've already hired and fired him.
I want him back, but there's no way he'll work for me again.
Well, have you thought of apologizing?
Of course.
You're welcome.
Hi, Mom!
Hey-y!
Here's my favourite couple.
You excited about your wedding?
- We certainly are.
- Aww...
Uhh, yeah, we have some ideas though.
Perfect.
Bring them on!
We, uh, love the work you've done.
Oh, please, please, it's no trouble.
And we think you have some great ideas.
Yeah.
You're making me blush!
It's just not really us.
Oh, thank you, I knew...
What?
Well, it's wonderful, it's just that we sort of, um...
What is it you're trying to say?
Yeah, what are you trying to say, Amaar?
Your idea for a wedding is, um...
You hate it!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
It's just that, as imam, the ceremony should be a little more Islamic.
Traditional.
We should've spelled that out better.
Oh!
My goodness, I'm so embarrassed.
No need to be embarrassed.
Of course!
I can do that.
Traditional!
Rayyan:
Don't feel bad, Mom.
No, this is our fault.
We have to make the time and do this ourselves.
Oh, no, please give me a chance to make this right.
I won't let you down, I swear.
Okay.
That's fine with us, Mom, sure, isn't it, Amaar?
Of course!
Rev. Thorne:
Baber?
Baber, come on, you can't avoid me forever.
- I can and I will.
- I want to apologize for firing you!
- You do?
- Yes.
I made a big mistake, listening to Fred Tupper, and I'm...
I'm very sorry.
You do sound sorry.
Yes, and I was wrong.
That's right, you were wrong.
And you were right.
You're not wrong about me being right.
No, and you'll work for me again, right?
Wrong.
What if I paid you more?
It's not about the money, it's about the principle.
- What principle is that?
- The principle that you are out of luck.
Unless...
Ah, yes?
Unless what?
You get that Fred Tupper to stop boycotting my radio ad.
- What?
- He refuses to play my ad, my wonderful, wonderful ad.
So if I get him to play the ad, you'll help me?
- Yes.
- Ah!
Uh, but what if he doesn't?
Then you will have to face the tax man all by yourself.
Also, my rate is now double.
Uh, you said this is about principle, not the... the money.
On principle I have to charge you more money.
Whah... ahh...
Hey-y, Freddie old pal!
Hey there, Revvy.
What can I do you for?
You here for the arm wrestling tix, huh?
Ah, yeah, as culturally invigorating as that sounds, no, thank you.
Uh, I'm here to buy some air time.
Oh, no problem-o.
Trying to lure the heathens back into Mercy Anglican?
Ha-ha!
No, it's not for the church, it's for, uh, Siddiqui Tax Services.
Whoa, no way, Padre.
Sorry, not enough money in the world to get me to air that spot.
I refuse on principle.
Come on!
When did everyone decide to get so principled?
Look, what'll it take to get you to air the ad, hmm?
There's nothing that I want from Baber Siddiqui.
Come on, surely there's something.
Rev, I care about one thing: ratings.
And since there's nothing he can do to boost my audience, it'll be a mosquito-free summer in Mercy before I let that ad pollute the airwaves again.
Fred, help a reverend out here.
Sorry, Rev, but there's no, uh, quid pro bono vox here, you know?
I mean, uh, if you could do a little something for me, maybe, you know, some kind of a gesture that would really boost my audience, well then, uh, maybe...
I'll do whatever it takes.
Whatever it takes?
Okay, just have a seat again.
You wanted traditional, you got it.
Ta-da!
A traditional Pakistani groom's hat.
I can see that.
Sarah:
And more good news!
I talked to the zoo and they have a lead the elephant you can ride in on.
An elephant?
Mom, you can't be serious.
A traditional Pakistani wedding is way more exciting than I realized!
I can't speak for Rayyan, but I'm not sure this is what I had in mind.
No, you can speak for me.
Well, if you don't want to go with the elephant, we can go with the horses.
I'm fine with either.
Look, Sarah,
I think it's wonderful that you're trying to give us the most perfect wedding.
- It really is.
- I feel a "but" coming.
But...
I'm not sure this represents us as a couple either.
So what do you want?
A day that's really special.
A day that holds meaning for us both and a day that we can share with the people we care most about.
Yeah.
That sounds perfect.
So what does that look like?
I think that's something you and I are going to have to figure out ourselves.
I hope that's okay.
No, no, I get it.
So that's a maybe on the hat, right?
Baber, tax man's coming.
You've got to help me.
I still have not heard my ad.
Please, please!
Help a reverend out here!
No ad, no help.
So, Reverend, can you explain why line 109 is double of what it was last year?
Uh-h-h-h...
Inflation?
What does this have to do with inflation?
Well, it's easy, you just, uh, carry the 2 and, uh, divide by 12, and, uh...
Ahh... ahem.
Fine, fine...
you got me dead to rights.
Look, uh, can we avoid the whole perp walk
- if I go quietly?
- Be a man.
Please, isn't there a soft spot in your heart for a poor Anglican minister?
I'm Jewish.
I'm screwed.
Baber's voice:
Does your tax return make your head explode?
Let Siddiqui Tax Services blow you away!
We do personal tax, business tax, sales tax!
Siddiqui Tax Services is A-1.
Refer a friend and get a free samosa.
Nice ad, eh?
Professor Siddiqui?
Bobby Nulman?
You remember me?
I remember all my students.
You were front row in my tax seminar.
404:
Decimals, The Dot Which Counts.
Your seminar changed my life!
It... it gave me purpose!
That's sad.
Ah, go... go on.
I'll never forget your words.
"The net realizable value can be determined
"by subtracting the estimate of uncollectible accounts
- from accounts receivable. "
- Receivable!
Yes, I was always ready with a good zinger.
Look, I...
I think it's too late, Baber.
- He knows about line 109.
- Line 109?
It's a... it's a tad confusing.
Oh, not at all.
It only seems high but that is because the Reverend has claimed petrol expenses.
He travels to visit sick parishioners and give them their little miniature bread wafers.
Is that it?
Yeah, I-I... administer the Eucharist to people who can't come to church.
Great.
That's it.
Really?
You came all this way for that?
Well, we could've handled this over the phone, but you told me you were a tax cheat 17 times.
Well, 18, really.
I can review your return if you like.
Oh, no, no, no!
No, no, it's, uh... it's quite all right.
Thank you.
- Bobby.
- Baber.
Professor Siddiqui.
"Realizable value".
What did I tell you?
Easy peasy.
Now, you tell me.
How did you get Fred to run my ad?
Uh...
And we're still looking for volunteers for the clothing drive, okay?
Finally, uh, before you go out into the world to spread the peace and joy of Christ, uh, listen to your hearts, listen to God Almighty, and above all, listen to Fred Tupper on CFRZ.
That's right, Fred Tupper, the only name in local radio entertainment.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, uh, as your guest speaker today, please welcome Fred Tupper.
- Thanks, Rev.
- Bah...
- Ahem...
Well!
People of Mercy, it is so good to be finally speaking to you in person, to know that you're right there, right in front of me, to know I can look you right in the eyes
and, uh, finally share all the, uh...
Where'd everybody go?
Oh, come on, Fred, nobody stays for the announcements.
Oh, uh, can you lock up on your way out?
You know, you've never told me what you want our wedding to be like
- other than "small".
- Oh.
Well, I haven't really thought about the day itself.
I was just more focused on what comes after.
Inappropriate!
Meaning...
- our new life together.
- Yeah.
Well, you know...
I have the perfect idea for us.
Rayyan Hamoudi, will you marry me here?
Amaar, this is perfect.
The spot where we got engaged.
I was thinking we could have an intimate ceremony out here...
Followed by a bash with our friends and family.
And speaking of family...
Hi.
Oh, it's perfect, just like Rayyan said.
This is going to be the most amazing wedding ever.
If this was your idea,
I can't wait to hear the rest of your plans for the wedding.
Well, we've still got a lot to figure out, but this is a good start.
You know, it's probably not too late to book that elephant.

They have hired one of the premier sports litigators in the State.
You let them hire my ex-wife?
She was the only name on the short list.
- So you two are together?
- Yes, we are together.
I hope he makes you every bit as happy as he made me.
That woman wants us dead.
You picked up on that, did you?
Nasty Kathy.
Fraternizing with the enemy?
If you dance with Alice, you have 100% chance of losing me.

You don't understand!
I'm pregnant out of wedlock at a Christian school.
This is the hardest thing I've ever done.
I'm raising this baby with no father in the picture.
- I know this girl.
- You do?
- Yeah!
- Her name is Deirdre Perkins.
She's the daughter of Rex.
Rex did all right by me for a long time.
One night he never came back.
He disappeared.
We go to Nationals in a few weeks.
To beat Mem-Chris we have to pull off the routine of our lives.

Looks like strep.
She's shaking from all of her body aches, which is unusual.
It suggests the infection may have begun to spread away from her throat.
There's a particularly nasty virus going around.
Highly contagious and resistant to drugs.
I'm going to do throat cultures on all of you, but in the meantime, is there anyone here who has a sore throat?
Stand over there.
Hey, I thought this was a "Good luck at Nationals" dinner.
What's with all the cots?
It's turned into a sleepover.
At least for the 20 of us who tested negative for strep.
Everyone else is back at Cheertown under quarantine.
Quarantine?
- Really?
- Yeah.
We need a minimum of 18 cheerleaders to compete.
We can't risk anyone else getting sick.
Hey.
- Oh, is that her?
- Yeah.
The long-lost sister.
Uh, Deirdre.
Come up and meet my friends.
She looks nervous.
Yeah, that's putting it mildly.
This girl is like a feral cat.
So, please be gentle, and..
And you, no jokes.
I don't want you to do anything that might offend her.
You're cutting me deep.
Um, Dan,
Savannah, I'd like you to meet my...
Sister, um, Deirdre.
You guys cheerleaders?
He's not, but I am.
I can't tell you how excited we are to finally meet you.
Welcome to the family, Deirdre.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wow, you are a cheerleader.
Can I please play your guitar?
Uh, sure.
Did I come on too strong?
Ha.
I forgot...!
Look what I got in the mail.
Is it from dad?
- Yep.
- Hmm.
Mom!
I wanted to read that.
Well, it's just more of the same.
I love you all, and I'm working so hard to clear my name.
And, oh, I'm golfing with O.J. looking for real criminals, blah blah blah.
I'm really worried about her.
It's a good thing we're all going to Nationals.
Could I have a refill, Wanda?
This will be your fourth.
Oh my, you saying I have a limit?
I guess not.
In your position, I'd be drinking, too.
A toast...
To strong women surviving faithless husbands.
I will drink to that.
Oh, me, too.
Who the hell is that?
I don't know, but she looks better going than coming.
Dr. Kennedy told me about the strep epidemic.
That's a bad break, huh?
I'm sorry, Emily, this is a private party.
You need to leave.
Don't be hostile.
Not in front of a student.
It diminishes your credibility as an educator.
Here's the thing.
I need to get a sworn statement from your boyfriend about the Steve Switzer pay-for-play situation.
You can take that up with Red.
He's ducking my calls.
Thought I might find him here, chillin' with his favorite cheerleader fantasy object.
Can we not do this in front of one of my students?
It's beyond inappropriate.
Uh, you two should probably talk in private.
No, no, I'm going.
I mean, the last thing I want is to be seen as inappropriate.
Although, you know what I think is really inappropriate?
Sleeping with a married man.
Uh...
What... uh...
- Just forget that you heard that.
- I don't think that was

Uh, sorry, I'm probably being a bad influence here.
No.
I'm happy here.
Well, I...
I...
I invited you because I wanted you to meet my friends, you know, get to know the people in my life.
I'm getting to know guitar guy here.
Well, you're not communicating with Travis, you're playing the guitar with him.
Well, now I'm not doing either.
Why would you think I'd want to hang with a bunch of shallow cheerleaders, anyway?
This whole thing is pathetic!
Wow.
You gonna go after her?
Yeah.
I'm not really in a rush, though.
How come?
She just stormed into the showers.
Uhh!
They lock these doors after hours.
Yeah.
What were you thinking in there?
Talking smack about cheerleaders in a room filled with cheerleaders?
So what?
I say what's on my mind
I want you to come with me to Nationals tomorrow.
You're serious?
I know, the cheerleading thing is weird.
I used to make fun of them, too.
But this thing we do together is...
Important to me.
These people are important to me.
Hell, I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I am stoked to win this thing and kick ass.
And I want you to be there.
So what, do I have to hug you now?
Do you want to?
Not really.
All right, then.

Yeah.

Thanks.
Can we talk?
Alone.
Yeah.
Whatever.
You haven't been returning my texts.
Honestly, I didn't see the point.
I mean, whatever was going on between us, you ended that at the dance marathon.
I'm sorry.
I was tired, I was in pain, and I wasn't thinking clearly.
Can we maybe try this again?
Fresh start?
Yeah, um, see, that...
that's a problem.
Why?
I'm more or less back with Alice now, so...
Oh.
Look, you walked out on me, remember?
You're right.
I just didn't, um...
Look, Kathy...
No, Lewis, I get it.
It's fine.
Good luck today.
How's my little girl?
- Hi, dad.
- Oh, gosh!
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi, honey.
Make you think of Rex?
No, it most definitely does not.
Oh, my God, what a huge surprise.
I had no idea that you guys were coming.
Well, I figured I owed you one.
And I slapped a tracking bracelet on his ankle this time, so the only way he is gonna miss your performance is if he chews his own leg off.
Baby, with my level of success, you know I pay somebody to chew it off for me.
Oh...
Oh, I stand corrected.
I am so glad you guys are here.
But I have to warn you, there was a major strep epidemic at Lancer.
We're down to a skeleton crew and I really have no idea what you're going to be seeing today, dad.
Well, you still gonna be fine.
Damn right.
Well, good.
Then I'm a happy man.
Ok, well, I'm happy, then.
Ok, guys.
The floor is ours.
All right, Hellcats, let's do it!
Let's get it!
Whoo!
Out of the gate.
1, 2.
We've been better.
We have alternates flying.
We have unfamiliar bases catching them.
We've lost all cohesion.
It's gonna be dicey.
You'll pull through.
Guys, you got it.
Oh!
Ahh!
Can we get a medic?
Medic.
Hi!
Yeah.
Where's Savannah?
She's not answering her phone.
Uh, she's a little busy right now.
Look, my water broke.
I'm having this baby.
You're still a month away from your due date.
Are you sure?
I'm hundreds of miles from home, going to a strange hospital with a strange doctor, yes, I'm sure, you moron.
Ohh!
Charlotte.
Charlotte, breathe.
Tell Savannah to get to Saint Luke's hospital now.
Yeah.
Oh, God!
Oh!
I'll call an ambulance.
Come on. we'll wait for them out front.
You can do it.
Just walk.
Walk.
What's wrong with you, woman?
Yeah.
Dan is driving me now.
I'll meet you at the maternity ward.
All right, 15 minutes top.
I love you bye.
Here, change of clothes.
Marti, I don't need a change of clothes.
We're going to the mat in 3 hours.
Listen, I'm just gonna go situate Charlotte, then come back for the performance, and then get back to the hospital before the baby is born.
The first labor is usually at minimum 17 hours.
Marti.
Only the last three or so are hard labor.
Except when it isn't.
Negativity?
Now?
Really?
Listen, I'm gonna be there for my sister and help the Hellcats win.
I bet you would never do that for me.
What do you mean?
Going after your sister and leave everyone in the lurch like Hello Kitty just did.
Ok, wait.
No, no.
She's not leaving anybody in a lurch.
And look, just don't talk like that in front of anybody in the squad, ok?
Ok.
And yes, if you needed me, I would drop everything.
No, you wouldn't.
I would.
I know we don't know each other very well, but you're my sister and...
That means something to me.
You're such a liar.
I don't care.
Savannah is cutting all our throats.
Her sister's in labor.
She's captain.
It is her job to be here.
Ooh, you raised some stone cold in your house, Mr. V.
Survival skills for a wicked world, man.
Uh, anyone know where the ladies' room is around here?
It through the dressing rooms to the left.
Hmm.
Would you mind showing me?
It's really just right...
You know, 'cause I get so turned around in these places.
I've got no sense of direction, you know.
Hmm?
What are you, 12?
Jeez, Kelly.
Here you go, little girl.
Here's your potty.
Ok, what's wrong with your throat?
Nothing.
Sure about that?
I'm fine.
What are you thinking?
Savannah is gone.
There is no more back-up.
If I go down, we forfeit.
A year's hard work down the drain,
- Kelly.
You could infect people.
I'm on antibiotics.
Promise you won't bust me?
I'm not making that promise.
We perform in 3 hours for 3 minutes.
That's all I need, Kelly.
3 hours and 3 minutes, then you can feed me all the chicken soup in the world, ok?
I'm serious.
Hello?
I'm sorry, what?
No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you?
Ok, I'll be right there.
No.
Calm... calm down.
I'll be right there.
Can I borrow your car?
Yeah.
Everything ok?
I'm not sure.
Just tell Alice I'll be back in time for the performance.
All right?
Man.
Mom!
Oh, Savannah.
Where's Char?
No way she's had the baby yet, right?
Please, please, please tell me she didn't have the baby.
No.
No, you did not miss it, but Charlotte is definitely in labor.
Ok.
Well, where's her room?
Let's go.
Mom.
What is it?
The doctors have told us to be prepared because sometimes premature babies can have heart problems during birth.
If his little lungs aren't fully developed...
I am so glad you are here.
I could not do this alone.
And despite of everything he has done to this family,
I still wish your father was here.
That makes me weak, huh?
No.
Listen, how many times have you told me the story about my birth?
29 hours of labor, right?
You were stubborn right from the very beginning.
It just means that we've been through a tough birth together before.
We can do it again.
Yes.
Let's pray.
We'll gather strength from God to help Charlotte with whatever comes.
Kathy?
Hello?
You here?
Oh.
Kathy.
Hey, Kathy, Kathy.
Hey.
Come on.
Wake up, wake up.
Come on.
Come on.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Lewis.
Uh, what are you doing here?
You called me, remember?
How much have you had to drink?
I don't know.
I was so upset about you and Alice.
Where are your clothes?
Bathroom.
Can I have your jacket?
I'm cold.
I can't believe you do this right before a performance.
I don't see anything.
What in the world?
What?
Open the door.
You brought this on yourself.
Open the door, Kathy.
Come on.
You are crazy!
Open the door.
I'm...
I'm just gonna kick it down.
Don't think so.
It's a pretty thick door.
Kathy.
Alice may not expect much from a boyfriend, but my standards are a little higher.
Boy... what?
We were never boyfriend and girlfriend.
We were just hanging out.
We had sex, Lewis.
You probably go around screwing anything that moves, but sex is a big commitment for me.
And if you knew that and did it anyway, you suck and deserve to miss Nationals.
If this is all news to you, you're stupid and deserve to miss Nationals.
Ok.
Kathy.
Heh heh heh.
Come on now.
I'm sorry, all right?
We can talk about this and, you know, we'll just work it all out.
Just let me out, all right?
Maybe next time you'll think twice before playing with someone else's feelings.

Monroe.
You have a phone call.
Hello?
I have called your cell a million times.
Why haven't you picked up?
Alice?
I am really sorry to do this, Savannah, but we have a big problem here.
We need you to come back immediately.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.
What's going on?
Lewis has gone missing and we're down to 17 people.
Missing?
Where is he?
I don't know.
But we're on in 15 minutes and Vanessa is trying to stall until you can get here.
We can't compete without you now.
Hello?
Savannah?
Look, my sister is in the middle of having a premature baby.
We don't even know what that means for the health of the baby yet.
But I do know that she needs me.
I'm her birth coach, and I'm not leaving her.
I cannot believe it.
You are really gonna give up all the hard work we've put in this entire year?
I'm sorry, Alice.
I can't believe this.
What's Savannah say?
She's not coming.
I get it.
I don't like it, but I get it.
You get it?
It's her sister.
Are you ok?
No.
Because I'm surrounded by a bunch of weaklings.

They move around like puppies.

I counted three times.
I'll go count for you.
Ahh!
Yes.
Yes!
Whoo!
You know what, Lewis is missing.
Yeah, he had some bad fish vindaloo last night.
He's probably in the bathroom.
All morning it's been two exits, no waiting.

- They've worked so hard.
- Rules are rules.
You need 18 bodies to compete.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
My God.
Thank you.
Oh, thank God.
Lewis.
Lancer University is next.
Ohh!
Wow, you got lucky.
Coach.
I know, I know.
Listen, just give us a second.
We're received an anonymous tip that members of your squad might have strep throat.
Now, we can't knowingly allow sick athletes to compete.
Now that we've been warned, we're obligated to check it out.
It's in our liability clause.
I'm sorry, but if any athlete tests positive, that athlete will be disqualified.
You'll have to put in one of your alternates.
We're already using a skeleton crew.
Well, then, you better hope no one tests positive.
Hey.
You want to tell me what happened?
3 of us tested positive for strep.
And you're one of the three?
Yeah.
They wouldn't let us three on the mat.
And without 18 bodies, we were disqualified.
I'm sorry, dad.
You came all this way and I... wasted your time.
Hey.
You could never waste my time.
Thanks.
I'm sorry you didn't get to perform.
You mean you're sorry we didn't win.
Hey.
I mean what I say, daughter of mine.
When I was playing ball, that end of the season game was healthy for the team.
It was like taking a huge exhale after... after holding your breath for the entire season.
Win or lose, it kept us centered for the upcoming year.
I never thought about it like that.
Well, you think of things my way more often, you have more success in life and a stronger immune system.
- That's right, it's true.
- So sorry, Alice.
You're dead to me.
What?
Why?
You knew I was sick and you ratted me out.
Is that true, baby?
No.
I admit I wasn't thrilled with you doing dangerous stunts while sick, but I would have never gone behind your back.
Well, if you didn't, then who did?
So did you hear the Hellcats were barred from competing at Nationals?
Oh, no.
Really?
National championship would have been good for Lancer.
Turns out an anonymous tipster alerted the competition officials that there'd been an outbreak of strep.
An anonymous tipster?
Really?
Phil, you don't think I'd stoop to sabotaging a cheer squad.
Isn't that a little bush league?
Well, now, I suppose that depends on what you were trying to accomplish.
What exactly were you trying to accomplish?
Heh.
I should have known I wouldn't be able to fool you.
Yeah, I made the call.
Slap on the cuffs, officer.
May I ask why?
Someone had to look after those kids.
Clearly coach Lodge was more concerned with winning than with the welfare of her athletes.
Wow.
You know, people get fired over allegations like that.
What you've done deprives this University of championship gold at a time where, quite frankly, we are desperate for good press.
This is a loss to the department.
More importantly, it's a disappointment to the Trustees.
Seriously, Emily, you've destroyed this woman's reputation just to settle a personal grudge?
Boy, oh, boy.
You must really hate that ex-husband of yours, huh?
I underestimated you, Phil.
I get that a lot.
So, who you gonna back, me or them?
Are you gonna bust me to the Trustees?
Emily, by any chance, are you seeing anyone right now?
As a matter of fact, no.
Heh.
He's a fighter.
Miss Monroe.
- Yes?
- Yes?
Dan.
Come meet little Joseph.
Whoa.
He is beautiful.
Oh, did Lewis show up on time?
Did we win?
Let's just focus on Joseph.
Ear buds.
Hey.
Ear buds.
Sorry about your cheerleader thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me, too.
But, um, believe it or not, we have something more important to talk about.
What?
You set a trap for me before.
You laid out there like you don't think I would be there for you.
When I respond with something supportive, you whack me down.
That is really messed up.
I'm messed up, college girl.
You don't like it, go away.
Oh.
That's your end game?
What's an end game?
- Like chess.
- Stupid game.
It's a great game, and you're changing the subject.
Why are you pushing me away?
Why don't you want this to work?
I love how you're blaming this on me.
I just need to understand.
For once tell me the truth.
Please, for once, tell me the truth.
Why do you keep sabotaging it?
I want a sister.
I really, really do.
And if that's something that you don't want, then you need to tell me now.
Right now.
Or I swear you're gonna break my heart.
You say that now.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean it.
Rex is the big prize.
Find out who he was, how he died.
We don't know he died.
How he maybe died.
Whatever.
Look, sooner or later the novelty of Rex is gonna wear off, ok.
We both know it.
You'll learn all you want to know or get bored, whatever, and by that time, maybe I'm getting used to having you around or your mom or all the cheerleaders.
- That will never...
- You'll move on to something fantastic and I'll have to go back to my old life.
I will never leave you.
I can't afford to hate something I may have to go back to.
- Do you see my problem?
- I will never leave you.
Ok?
I won't leave you.
All your friends are watching us.
Don't care.
You're crazy.
It apparently runs in my family.
Heh.
Why are you all packing up?
Competition's over.
I came here to do our routine at Nationals, and I'm not leaving until we do.
Alice, you're sick.
Probably getting all of us sick.
We have all summer to recover.
Tonight only happens once.
You're doing this why?
'Cause what, you don't want to let your dad down?
I don't want to let us down.
We have sweated and bled for this.
I fractured my wrist.
Gretchen broke her arm.
Wedge blew out her knee and quit.
The list goes on, you guys.
We have earned our moment.
We have earned the right to go out there under those lights and do what we came here to do.
We lost.
There's not really any point.
Yes, there is.
No, there really isn't.
Actually, there is.
It's called "Art for Art's Sake."
In 19th century France, it was a slogan that the bohemian artists used to shout at their critics.
Oh, here we go.
Ok, listen.
I got the keys to the bus, all right?
It's a long walk back to Memphis.
They were rebels.
And they believed that there is nothing more dignified, more honorable, than beauty created for the sake of itself and the satisfaction of the artist.
Make no mistake, we are artists.
We are athletes.
We are bobbleheads!
Tonight, we have a chance to create something spectacular, not for the trophies or the applause or the greater glory of a bunch of football players.
Tonight, we do it for us.
Hellcats, I know this is usually Savannah's job, but...

One week old and perfect.
I wish I could say the same for the rest of my family.
What's wrong?
Charlotte's in way over her head, being a single mom, and my mother... well, she's basically a mess.
What happened at Nationals is going to happen again.
It's bound to.
And I can't let it hurt the squad.
You need to be focused.
We need strong leadership if we're going beat Mem-Chris next year.

She's the daughter of Rex.
Rex did all right by me for a long time.
One night he never came back.

She's shaking from all of her body aches, which is unusual.
It suggests the infection may have begun to spread away from her throat.

Highly contagious and resistant to drugs.
I'm going to do throat cultures on all of you, but in the meantime, is there anyone here who has a sore throat?
Stand over there.
Hey, I thought this was a "Good luck at Nationals" dinner.
What's with all the cots?
It's turned into a sleepover.
At least for the 20 of us who tested negative for strep.
Everyone else is back at Cheertown under quarantine.

- Really?
- Yeah.

That's a bad break, huh?
I'm sorry, Emily, this is a private party.
You need to leave.
Don't be hostile.
Not in front of a student.
It diminishes your credibility as an educator.
Here's the thing.
I need to get a sworn statement from your boyfriend about the Steve Switzer pay-for-play situation.
You can take that up with Red.
He's ducking my calls.
Thought I might find him here, chillin' with his favorite cheerleader fantasy object.
Can we not do this in front of one of my students?
It's beyond inappropriate.
Uh, you two should probably talk in private.
No, no, I'm going.
I mean, the last thing I want is to be seen as inappropriate.

Never too soon for jokes.
♪ Please ♪
All right, guys, take five.
We'll talk about the stunts after...
There's spies amongst us.
Come on, you guys, it's all right.
Welcome to Atlanta.
Lookin' good up there.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Can we talk?
Alone.
Yeah.
Whatever.
You haven't been returning my texts.
Honestly, I didn't see the point.
I mean, whatever was going on between us, you ended that at the dance marathon.
I'm sorry.
I was tired, I was in pain, and I wasn't thinking clearly.
Can we maybe try this again?
Fresh start?
Yeah, um, see, that...
that's a problem.
Why?
I'm more or less back with Alice now, so...
Oh.
Look, you walked out on me, remember?
You're right.
I just didn't, um...
Look, Kathy...
No, Lewis, I get it.
It's fine.
Good luck today.
How's my little girl?
- Hi, dad.
- Oh, gosh!
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi, honey.
Make you think of Rex?
No, it most definitely does not.
Oh, my God, what a huge surprise.
I had no idea that you guys were coming.
Well, I figured I owed you one.
And I slapped a tracking bracelet on his ankle this time, so the only way he is gonna miss your performance is if he chews his own leg off.
Baby, with my level of success, you know I pay somebody to chew it off for me.
Oh...
Oh, I stand corrected.
I am so glad you guys are here.
But I have to warn you, there was a major strep epidemic at Lancer.
We're down to a skeleton crew and I really have no idea what you're going to be seeing today, dad.
Well, you still gonna be fine.
Damn right.
Well, good.
Then I'm a happy man.
Ok, well, I'm happy, then.
Ok, guys.
The floor is ours.
All right, Hellcats, let's do it!
Let's get it!
Whoo!
Out of the gate.
1, 2.
We've been better.
We have alternates flying.
We have unfamiliar bases catching them.
We've lost all cohesion.
It's gonna be dicey.
You'll pull through.
Guys, you got it.
Oh!
Ahh!
Can we get a medic?
Medic.
Hi!
Yeah.
Where's Savannah?
She's not answering her phone.
Uh, she's a little busy right now.
Look, my water broke.
I'm having this baby.
You're still a month away from your due date.
Are you sure?
I'm hundreds of miles from home, going to a strange hospital with a strange doctor, yes, I'm sure, you moron.
Ohh!
Charlotte.
Charlotte, breathe.
Tell Savannah to get to Saint Luke's hospital now.
Yeah.
Oh, God!
Oh!
I'll call an ambulance.
Come on. we'll wait for them out front.
You can do it.
Just walk.
Walk.
What's wrong with you, woman?
Yeah.
Dan is driving me now.
I'll meet you at the maternity ward.
All right, 15 minutes top.
I love you bye.
Here, change of clothes.
Marti, I don't need a change of clothes.
We're going to the mat in 3 hours.
Listen, I'm just gonna go situate Charlotte, then come back for the performance, and then get back to the hospital before the baby is born.
The first labor is usually at minimum 17 hours.
Marti.
Only the last three or so are hard labor.
Except when it isn't.
Negativity?
Now?
Really?
Listen, I'm gonna be there for my sister and help the Hellcats win.
I bet you would never do that for me.
What do you mean?
Going after your sister and leave everyone in the lurch like Hello Kitty just did.
Ok, wait.
No, no.
She's not leaving anybody in a lurch.
And look, just don't talk like that in front of anybody in the squad, ok?
Ok.
And yes, if you needed me, I would drop everything.
No, you wouldn't.
I would.
I know we don't know each other very well, but you're my sister and...
That means something to me.
You're such a liar.
I don't care.
Savannah is cutting all our throats.
Her sister's in labor.
She's captain.
It is her job to be here.
Ooh, you raised some stone cold in your house, Mr. V.
Survival skills for a wicked world, man.
Uh, anyone know where the ladies' room is around here?
It through the dressing rooms to the left.
Hmm.
Would you mind showing me?
It's really just right...
You know, 'cause I get so turned around in these places.
I've got no sense of direction, you know.
Hmm?
What are you, 12?
Jeez, Kelly.
Here you go, little girl.
Here's your potty.
Ok, what's wrong with your throat?
Nothing.
Sure about that?
I'm fine.
What are you thinking?
Savannah is gone.
There is no more back-up.
If I go down, we forfeit.
A year's hard work down the drain,
- Kelly.
You could infect people.
I'm on antibiotics.
Promise you won't bust me?
I'm not making that promise.
We perform in 3 hours for 3 minutes.
That's all I need, Kelly.
3 hours and 3 minutes, then you can feed me all the chicken soup in the world, ok?
I'm serious.
Hello?
I'm sorry, what?
No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you?
Ok, I'll be right there.
No.
Calm... calm down.
I'll be right there.
Can I borrow your car?
Yeah.
Everything ok?
I'm not sure.
Just tell Alice I'll be back in time for the performance.
All right?
Man.
Mom!
Oh, Savannah.
Where's Char?
No way she's had the baby yet, right?
Please, please, please tell me she didn't have the baby.
No.
No, you did not miss it, but Charlotte is definitely in labor.
Ok.
Well, where's her room?
Let's go.
Mom.
What is it?
The doctors have told us to be prepared because sometimes premature babies can have heart problems during birth.
If his little lungs aren't fully developed...
I am so glad you are here.
I could not do this alone.
And despite of everything he has done to this family,
I still wish your father was here.
That makes me weak, huh?
No.
Listen, how many times have you told me the story about my birth?
29 hours of labor, right?
You were stubborn right from the very beginning.
It just means that we've been through a tough birth together before.
We can do it again.
Yes.
Let's pray.
We'll gather strength from God to help Charlotte with whatever comes.
Kathy?
Hello?
You here?
Oh.
Kathy.
Hey, Kathy, Kathy.
Hey.
Come on.
Wake up, wake up.
Come on.
Come on.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Lewis.
Uh, what are you doing here?
You called me, remember?
How much have you had to drink?
I don't know.
I was so upset about you and Alice.
Where are your clothes?
Bathroom.
Can I have your jacket?
I'm cold.
I can't believe you do this right before a performance.
I don't see anything.
What in the world?
What?
Open the door.
You brought this on yourself.
Open the door, Kathy.
Come on.
You are crazy!
Open the door.
I'm...
I'm just gonna kick it down.
Don't think so.
It's a pretty thick door.
Kathy.
Alice may not expect much from a boyfriend, but my standards are a little higher.
Boy... what?
We were never boyfriend and girlfriend.
We were just hanging out.
We had sex, Lewis.
You probably go around screwing anything that moves, but sex is a big commitment for me.
And if you knew that and did it anyway, you suck and deserve to miss Nationals.
If this is all news to you, you're stupid and deserve to miss Nationals.
Ok.
Kathy.
Heh heh heh.
Come on now.
I'm sorry, all right?
We can talk about this and, you know, we'll just work it all out.
Just let me out, all right?
Maybe next time you'll think twice before playing with someone else's feelings.

Monroe.
You have a phone call.
Hello?
I have called your cell a million times.
Why haven't you picked up?
Alice?
I am really sorry to do this, Savannah, but we have a big problem here.
We need you to come back immediately.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.
What's going on?
Lewis has gone missing and we're down to 17 people.
Missing?
Where is he?
I don't know.
But we're on in 15 minutes and Vanessa is trying to stall until you can get here.
We can't compete without you now.
Hello?
Savannah?
Look, my sister is in the middle of having a premature baby.
We don't even know what that means for the health of the baby yet.
But I do know that she needs me.
I'm her birth coach, and I'm not leaving her.
I cannot believe it.
You are really gonna give up all the hard work we've put in this entire year?
I'm sorry, Alice.
I can't believe this.
What's Savannah say?
She's not coming.
I get it.
I don't like it, but I get it.
You get it?
It's her sister.
Are you ok?
No.
Because I'm surrounded by a bunch of weaklings.

They move around like puppies.

I counted three times.
I'll go count for you.
Ahh!
Yes.
Yes!
Whoo!
You know what, Lewis is missing.
Yeah, he had some bad fish vindaloo last night.
He's probably in the bathroom.

- They've worked so hard.
- Rules are rules.
You need 18 bodies to compete.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
My God.
Thank you.
Oh, thank God.
Lewis.
Lancer University is next.
Ohh!
Wow, you got lucky.
Coach.
I know, I know.
Listen, just give us a second.
We're received an anonymous tip that members of your squad might have strep throat.
Now, we can't knowingly allow sick athletes to compete.
Now that we've been warned, we're obligated to check it out.
It's in our liability clause.
I'm sorry, but if any athlete tests positive, that athlete will be disqualified.
You'll have to put in one of your alternates.
We're already using a skeleton crew.
Well, then, you better hope no one tests positive.
Hey.
You want to tell me what happened?
3 of us tested positive for strep.
And you're one of the three?
Yeah.
They wouldn't let us three on the mat.
And without 18 bodies, we were disqualified.
I'm sorry, dad.
You came all this way and I... wasted your time.
Hey.
You could never waste my time.
Thanks.
I'm sorry you didn't get to perform.
You mean you're sorry we didn't win.
Hey.
I mean what I say, daughter of mine.
When I was playing ball, that end of the season game was healthy for the team.
It was like taking a huge exhale after... after holding your breath for the entire season.
Win or lose, it kept us centered for the upcoming year.
I never thought about it like that.
Well, you think of things my way more often, you have more success in life and a stronger immune system.
- That's right, it's true.
- So sorry, Alice.
You're dead to me.
What?
Why?
You knew I was sick and you ratted me out.
Is that true, baby?
No.
I admit I wasn't thrilled with you doing dangerous stunts while sick, but I would have never gone behind your back.
Well, if you didn't, then who did?
So did you hear the Hellcats were barred from competing at Nationals?
Oh, no.
Really?
National championship would have been good for Lancer.
Turns out an anonymous tipster alerted the competition officials that there'd been an outbreak of strep.
An anonymous tipster?
Really?
Phil, you don't think I'd stoop to sabotaging a cheer squad.
Isn't that a little bush league?
Well, now, I suppose that depends on what you were trying to accomplish.
What exactly were you trying to accomplish?
Heh.
I should have known I wouldn't be able to fool you.
Yeah, I made the call.
Slap on the cuffs, officer.
May I ask why?
Someone had to look after those kids.
Clearly coach Lodge was more concerned with winning than with the welfare of her athletes.
Wow.
You know, people get fired over allegations like that.
What you've done deprives this University of championship gold at a time where, quite frankly, we are desperate for good press.
This is a loss to the department.
More importantly, it's a disappointment to the Trustees.
Seriously, Emily, you've destroyed this woman's reputation just to settle a personal grudge?
Boy, oh, boy.
You must really hate that ex-husband of yours, huh?
I underestimated you, Phil.
I get that a lot.
So, who you gonna back, me or them?
Are you gonna bust me to the Trustees?
Emily, by any chance, are you seeing anyone right now?
As a matter of fact, no.
Heh.
He's a fighter.
Miss Monroe.
- Yes?
- Yes?
Dan.
Come meet little Joseph.
Whoa.
He is beautiful.
Oh, did Lewis show up on time?
Did we win?
Let's just focus on Joseph.
Ear buds.
Hey.
Ear buds.
Sorry about your cheerleader thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me, too.
But, um, believe it or not, we have something more important to talk about.
What?
You set a trap for me before.
You laid out there like you don't think I would be there for you.
When I respond with something supportive, you whack me down.
That is really messed up.
I'm messed up, college girl.
You don't like it, go away.
Oh.
That's your end game?
What's an end game?
- Like chess.
- Stupid game.
It's a great game, and you're changing the subject.
Why are you pushing me away?
Why don't you want this to work?
I love how you're blaming this on me.
I just need to understand.
For once tell me the truth.
Please, for once, tell me the truth.
Why do you keep sabotaging it?
I want a sister.
I really, really do.
And if that's something that you don't want, then you need to tell me now.
Right now.
Or I swear you're gonna break my heart.
You say that now.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean it.
Rex is the big prize.
Find out who he was, how he died.
We don't know he died.
How he maybe died.
Whatever.
Look, sooner or later the novelty of Rex is gonna wear off, ok.
We both know it.
You'll learn all you want to know or get bored, whatever, and by that time, maybe I'm getting used to having you around or your mom or all the cheerleaders.
- That will never...
- You'll move on to something fantastic and I'll have to go back to my old life.
I will never leave you.
I can't afford to hate something I may have to go back to.
- Do you see my problem?
- I will never leave you.
Ok?
I won't leave you.
All your friends are watching us.
Don't care.
You're crazy.
It apparently runs in my family.
Heh.
Why are you all packing up?
Competition's over.
I came here to do our routine at Nationals, and I'm not leaving until we do.
Alice, you're sick.
Probably getting all of us sick.
We have all summer to recover.
Tonight only happens once.
You're doing this why?
'Cause what, you don't want to let your dad down?
I don't want to let us down.
We have sweated and bled for this.
I fractured my wrist.
Gretchen broke her arm.
Wedge blew out her knee and quit.
The list goes on, you guys.
We have earned our moment.
We have earned the right to go out there under those lights and do what we came here to do.
We lost.
There's not really any point.
Yes, there is.
No, there really isn't.
Actually, there is.
It's called "Art for Art's Sake."
In 19th century France, it was a slogan that the bohemian artists used to shout at their critics.
Oh, here we go.
Ok, listen.
I got the keys to the bus, all right?
It's a long walk back to Memphis.
They were rebels.
And they believed that there is nothing more dignified, more honorable, than beauty created for the sake of itself and the satisfaction of the artist.
Make no mistake, we are artists.
We are athletes.
We are bobbleheads!
Tonight, we have a chance to create something spectacular, not for the trophies or the applause or the greater glory of a bunch of football players.
Tonight, we do it for us.
Hellcats, I know this is usually Savannah's job, but...

One week old and perfect.
I wish I could say the same for the rest of my family.
What's wrong?
Charlotte's in way over her head, being a single mom, and my mother... well, she's basically a mess.
What happened at Nationals is going to happen again.
It's bound to.
And I can't let it hurt the squad.

Hello?
Is that supposed to be a joke?
Hello, Mr. Caulfield.
What's up?
Hello, Elliott.
Where are you now?
Caulfield...
Somewhere just behind Laconia.
Who have you seen so far?
Van der Leest just now, in Worcester.
Brighton and Bellamy, that was this morning.
And yesterday evening:
Meyering in New Haven.
And?
Any Success?
Brighton and Bellamy have signed.
Meyering is gonna think about it again, the cheapskate...
I would have appreciated it, if you had told me this, Elliott.
Did you really think, Brighton and Bellamy wouldn't have signed?
I'm sorry but we had them both in the bag already.
- I would have told you anyways, okay?
- Next time then please!
Tomorrow, for example.
Who are you seeing tomorrow?
Er...
Enochs in Salisbury.
I will have to drive quite a bit for this.
I'm gonna look for a hotel or motel somewhere to stay overnight, and I will drive the rest tomorrow.
I will call you as soon as...
- Are you getting ill, Elliott?
- No, no problem.
I just have a bit of a cold, nothing more.
OK then.
Do you have anything else for me?
No, have a rest.
And call me as soon as you know which hotel you are in.
Will do.
I will tell you where you can contact me then.
See you later.
Tfth...
What a motherfucker...
Okay...
What a hick-town.
Desdemona Hotel.
Doesn't sound so bad though?
Hello!
Hello!
What kind of place is this where nobody is at the reception desk?
You could be a bit more patient, Sir.
Oh come on!
That, that is really outrageous...
Do you really think this is your business?
Oh nothing... nothing sir.
I just thought, he may be busy doing something else?
Yeah, hehe, he is.
To stand here and to give me a room.
That's what he should be busy with.
About time...
Good evening, Sir.
What can I do for you?
- Give me a room, please.
- Immediately, Sir.
Room, 12, second floor.
- Name please?
- Elliott Davis.
How much is the room?
- 45 Dollar per night.
- Payment at departure.
- Do you take credit cards?
- No.
Only cash.
Well, Whatever.
I'm afraid, you have to carry your suitcase today.
I'm afraid, I don't know where Pierre is.
Really?
I think I know where he is.
Shut up, Lloyd.
Like I said, Room 12, second floor.
- Staircase is here, lift is over there.
- Hmm.
Over there.
Good, that we found you again.
Everything is okay.
We will take you back again.
- Leave him alone, Lloyd.
- He's our guest, okay?
I wish you a nice stay in the Hotel Desdemona.
Good evening, Sir.
Mmm.
Anyways, thanks for carrying my bags, Pierre...
Okay, I've stayed in worse hotels before...
No, you can't get 'em now...
Take a break, Elliott, take a break.
Take an aspirin.
Great...
Hello, Mr. Caulfield.
I'm lying here in Desdemona Hotel, room 12.
But don't dare call me.
I will probably not remain alone this night.
If only...
Yes?
Yes, Hello.
I said I'd contact you when I found a hotel.
- I am in the Desdemona hotel.
- Who is it?
- Elliot Davis.
Who else?
- Are you making fun of me?
What?
Th.. it is Elliot, Man.
Insurance agent, did you forget that already'?
Never call me again.
Do you understand that?
What?
- Listen to me...
- Never again!
Understand that?
What the hell are you doing you...moron...
This can't be...
The guy got Alzheimer's or something?
This number is currently unavailable.
Hello?
Harry is not here.
Yeah, I can see that.
You can tell "Harry" that his attitude towards work stinks.
Harry is not here.
Tth..
Hey, old man, is there a bar or something Ln this hotel?
Examine.
You are a complete idiot, aren't you?
A Gin Tonic, please?
- Small, large?
- A small one for now...
It's on it's way...
What... is so interesting about this guy?
- What?
- You... seem to stare at him all the time.
He doesn't look that good - that's my opinion anyways.
Maybe you think about that differently.
- May I?
- I don't mind...
- And?

Who is it, Sir?
Is it the same woman again?

Harry, is that you?
I am not interested in games like this.
Fuck you.
Do you hear me?
Fuck you!
You're awake too, Elliott?
What's up?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Maybe I am doing that now.
You are still looking ill.
I didn't notice much of that before.
- How long did I sleep?
What time is it?
- Does that matter?
We have so much time.
We can spend the entire day together if you want.
Just the two of us.
No, we are not going to do this.
Why are you still here?
- What do you mean?
- Put on your clothes and get out.
I have to leave early tomorrow morning and I will need a bit of sleep.
Why are you doing this?
I thought, we would...
- You said that you loved me.
- No, I haven't said that.
Surely not!
Isn't it obvious to you that I just wanted to have fun with you and nothing else?
And you only wanted to have fun with me yourself as well.
Why are you doing this?
I...
I love you.
- And you said that you loved me too.
- What are you talking about?
You wanted it hard and dirty.
And you got that.
It was nice, yeah, but now be so nice and get out of here.
You haven't changed at all, Elliott.
You have not become any wiser.
What the hell...?
We don't even know each other!
You behave like a massive asshole again.
- Like the last time.
- "Like the last time"?
I have never met you before this evening!
Why did you do this do me?
What?
Did I do something to you?
I trusted you.
After all we have gone through in this shithole.
Why did you do this to me?
I haven't done anything to you.
To be clear now:
I didn't do anything that you didn't want.
- You wanted to be fucked...
- I'm not talking about this!
I want to know why you did this to me?
What, for god's sake?
You fucking know what I'm talking about.
Don't look at me like this!
I don't want you looking at me like this, you dirty swine.
What did you do to me?
To all of us?
You are sick!
They were right.
They were right about everything.
You said that you loved me.
I just wanted to be loved.
Just go now.
You now got what you wanted.
For fucks sake, I have no idea what you're talking about, Regina.
Now, please tell me what's going on.
I loved you.
Why did you do that?
Hey, Pierre, goddammit!
Are you deaf or what, you idiot?
Hey, you asshole!
Oh, shit...
This is my room!
Elliott!
Elliott!
You know who I am, don't you?
Of course you know who I am.
I am Dr. Van Kessler.
We know each other.
I am glad we've found you again.
Everything is okay, we will take you back again.
Please come back.
You don't belong here.
Just come back with us.
I'm not fucking doing anything!
I want a different room, Harry!
One moment, Sir.
Yes, Mr. Davis, what do you wish?
A different room.
I just said that before, correct?
A different room?
Why?
Is there something wrong with your room?
Yes, you can say that.
A woman hanged herself in my room,
And a minute ago a chopped up body was lying on my bed.
But apart from that, everything is okay!
I don't think I understand you, Sir.
I don't care if you understand me or not.
Just please give me another room!
I'm afraid, Sir, at the moment, there is no other free room.
Do you think I'm stupid?
!
Look how many keys there are!
I said:
There are no free rooms in this hotel.
I am sorry.
Now.
Listen to me...
Don't talk... to me.
Like this...
You are not going to...
Give me another room, right now!
Okay, if you really want it, Sir, here...
- One floor up.
- Thanks.
Give it to me!
One moment, Sir.
I have to note that you have changed the room.
Okay, now...
Mr. Davis, room 21.
You will like this room, Sir.
It's furnished very nicely.
One of the nicest rooms we have here.
There was nobody in this room for quite a while, but things are like that.
Too expensive, you see.
Well, you know these things:
Everything has a price in life.
Are you feeling unwell Sir?
You are looking pale.
Shall I bring you a glass of water?
Or do you maybe want something stronger to drink?
Sir!
You forgot to sign the paper!
Come in.
I cannot look at it.
I really can't.
It is... it is so terribly beautiful...
For my eyes... so unreal...
like a dream.
- Do you understand?
- It is like a fairytale.
Like you knew it in your childhood.
It is just a fairytale.
My head is turning.
They are all there.
All!
They are dancing!
Dancing, without moving...
I can't hold them...
Come here, my love.
My poor, beautiful man.
It makes me sad, so terribly sad.
When I see this...
at the same time.
It is so beautiful.
Oh god, I wish I could help you.
It was so nice, so nice...
As she was lying there...
so nice... so pure...
Yes?
Yes, one moment.
One moment!
Yes?
Well, I'm here now.
Are you going to let me in?
Why should I?
Who are you anyways?
Oh, sorry.
I'm Candice.
Are you going to let me in now?
What the hell do you want, Candice?
Well... well I never heard this kind of question from a customer before.
What?
Who sent you?
Harry?
Or the queer guy?
You must be joking.
You ordered me.
Who else then?
No, I haven't ordered you.
Surely not.
Desdemona Hotel, Room 12.
You have ordered a girl.
Here I am.
Could we start now please?
Other customers are waiting for me, you know.
How nice... first the fag, and now the whore.
I am very happy, that I am this popular...
Don't call me a whore, okay?
I hate it when someone calls me that.
Okay, I am sorry.
Okay.
Put the money on the table, and then just tell me how you want it.
I will do anything as long as you don't hurt me.
- Just relax.
I will do the rest.
- You aren't gonna do anything.
Get out!
Hey... are you mad or what?
First you order me and now you want to chuck me out?
Do you think I haven't got better things to do?
I didn't ordered you.
Now get out!
Okay?
- Okay, but I still want my money!
- Are you mad?
What for?
I should have known.
The others said something wasn't right with you.
Do you remember what happened with Dina?
She still knows it.
What happened with her is not gonna happen again!
- Get out now!
- I'm going now!
Asshole.
Exanimo.
What do you wish, Sir?
Erm...
Room 12.. please...
I'm afraid, Sir.
Room 12 does not exist.
Of course... of course.
I live in room 12.
I'm afraid no, Sir.
There is no room number 12 in this house.
Of course, of course...
I am sleeping... in room 12...
Yes, I do...
He's back again.
Do you have him, Doctor?
Very careful.
- No signs of a breakdown.
- Have you fixed the patient properly?
Yes. he is fixed.
We can start now.
He is stable, Dr. Caufield.
Better give him another sedative.
Yes, would be better.
Prepare the the needle already.
- Is the morphine working already?
- No.
Good, let's not wait any longer.
We have to see other patients as well.
Exanimo.
White as snow.
Red as blood.
And black like ebony.
Go away!
I want him to go away!
As soon as the wolf said this, he jumped out of the bed towards poor Red Riding Hood.
After the wolf satisfied his desire, he lay himself back into bed and fell asleep.
The hunter entered the room, and as he approached the bed, he saw that the wolf was laying there.
"Finding you here, you old sinner,"
he said, "I have been looking for you for a long time."
He then wanted to position his rifle, as he remembered that...
They were all right.
They should have never done this.
They were right.
Why did you do this?
I haven't done anything to you!
Why are you doing this?
I do love you.
And you said that you do love me as well.
What are you doing here?
I just want you to love me.
You do love me, don't you?
Let all your anger out on me!
Let it all out!
Do you see the stork?
Haven't you seen the stork?
He's flying over there.
He died.
Where have you been, Gregory?
I have been waiting for you.
Why are you calling me Gregory?
My name is not Gregory.
Why?
I, no, you...
I have been waiting.
So long, so long, so long waiting.
So long, so long!
You have said...
You have said.
Said, said, said, you understand?
!
Said...
What did I say?
Gilbert is mad at you, really mad at you.
Because Gilbert waited.
The trees you said, the trees!
You wanted to show the trees to Gilbert.
And the deer, the deer, the deer, the deer.
- The deer is dead too, isn't it?
Isn't it?
- I think so, yes.
That is sad.
That is so sad.
Gilbert finds that so sad.
What's going on?
What is so funny?
- Gregory!
Gregory!
Gregory!
- Stop that nonsense!
Where am I?
What is this here?
An asylum, isn't it?
At home, at home, at home.
You are at home.
A long journey...
- A long journey...
- How can I get out of here?
Out!
Out!
How do you get out?
Out of your head!
Your head!
Out of your head!
Head!
Why are you in my head?
Why are you in my head?
Why are you in my mind?
Go out!
Go out of my head!
What... do you want from me?
I don't know you; why don't you leave me in peace?
No, I haven't, no...
You don't understand that.
You never could understand that.
It is in my head...
like an ulcer.
This restlessness...
I am not here...
I haven't been here for a long time.
Have I ever been here?
No!
I don't know you!
Have no fear, have no fear!
Why are you in my head?
Why are you in my head?
- What do you want from me?
- What do you want from me?
- Exanimo.
- Exanimo.
Why are you doing this to me?
Why, why?
Isn't she beautiful?
Such a beautiful girl...
She didn't really scream at all.
Not really.
Just... a little bit.
Just a tiny little bit.
"No, don't hurt me!
Please don't hurt me!"
"You can do everything with me, as long as you don't hurt me."
- Why are you doing this, Gregory?
- No!
She deserves it, yes.
- Why are you doing such things?
- No!
No!
No!
No questions!
No questions!
- I need to know, goddammit.
Who are you?
- No!
Don't ask!
Who are you, you perverted pig?
And why are you in my head?
Why are you in my head?
Why are you in my head?
In my head, head, head, head!
Why are you asking me that?
Why are you asking me, even though I said you shouldn't ask me?
- Who are you?
- I?
I am the bad wolf, yes.
Why... am I seeing what you see?
Maybe you are... in my head.
Who are you...
You know it, don't you?
You do know me.
As good as you know yourself.
I have no business with you!
You are just a sick madman!
No!
No, don't say this to me!
Why are you saying this to me?
It was... it was only... it was so nice!
It was... it was only...
Why are you saying this to me?
Bad wolf!

You are doing it again.
As said:
You are doing it again and again.
That's just how you are, my dear.
No.
It... it wasn't me.
I haven't done this.
Oh of course not...
I know, it is...
It is bizarre when you realize it.
That one has done it, I mean.
Oh yes...
I..
I couldn't do something like this.
I can't do this.
I haven't done this.
What a whore.
Like all the others before her.
You've never been choosy.
And she nearly didn't scream at all.
Just a tiny little bit.
What is going on?
Oh... all those people...
all those, those...
It was so... nice.
So wonderful.
Why is that in my head?
All... are dead.
Because you needed to do it again and again!
So much blood... horrible!
No.
It.. it wasn't me.
I haven't done that!
I...
I haven't killed anyone...
No one!
Poor Gregory...
I am afraid that you did so.
I am not Gregory.
I am not a damn beast.
No...
Oh, Gregory, you are so blind.
It is right in front of your eyes, and you can't see it.
You can't see who you are.
I am Elliott Davis!
Elliott Davis!
I am not Gregory Stainer!
Oh yes.
Why can't you see and recognize this?
It is you, my lover.
You are lying!
You are lying!
You are lying!

I a me!
I do know who I am!
I do know who I am...
Why are you in my head?
In which head?
In which head, Gregory?
It was so nice... so nice, wasn't it?
My... your longing for the death is eating you up, isn't it?
You want to feel, see how others experience it.
Did you like it, to kill her?
Was it nice?
Be quiet.
Be quiet!
Shut your damn mouth!
I can't handle this anymore!
I can't handle this anymore...
You cannot do this anymore?
Yes?
In the drawer is a pistol.
Take it!
Kill me!
Like all the others!
Like the whore!
Why...
Why don't you just leave me in peace?
Huh?
From what, hehe, do you want to run away?
From yourself, yes?
Do you want to run away from yourself?
I just want this nightmare to end!
I just want to wake up!
I just want to wake up, only this!
You are dreaming, yes...
Yes... we are both dreaming a sweet dream.
A fairytale.
Just wake up...
I just want to wake up.
I don't want anything else.
Just want to wake up!
Why, Gregory?
You know who you are.
You have said that you love me.
Let all your anger out on me.
Do you want to satisfy your longing, yes?
Yes?
Yes?
Do you?
Fire then!
Satisfy the longing!
Get out!
Get out of my head!
You aren't real...
It is just a nightmare.
It isn't real at all.
It is a nightmare.
You've guessed it.
It is only a dream...
The dream, which we call life!
The anger.
Your anger!
Your anger.
Let it out.
My head!
No... no questions.
Elliott!
You don't belong here.
Oh yes, a dream!
A fairytale.
You will see it.
Why?
Why are you doing this?
The death, Gregory...
Bad wolf.

Who told you that my daughter Shruti loves you.
But.
- Wait first you stop this dream.
Be practical in life.
And perhaps you will no feel good to know that..
Shruti is already engaged.
No uncle you think that I am not responsible..
..and funny that is why you are telling like this.
But uncle I will show you to make like that as you..
..want a boy for Shruti.
I also learned that baby step also.
Please uncle.
Wait perhaps you are misunderstanding to me.
You believe me that I am not speaking false to you.
Shurti is really engaged.
Next month she is going to be married.
The boy is coming from U.S. and everything has been finalized.
Trust me.
And now Shruti if even desire then also can not marry you..
because it will be wrong with some one.
I want to be happy.
That's all.
My parent are so good and they have given everything to me.
Friend willing to sacrifice life..
..and you?
What to you?
Brother I have always seen you happy..
..but never seen so sorry like this.
Come on yaar..

I know that she loves me and I can do anything for her.
But why I could not get her.
Shruti I love you.
Yes, Shruti.
Papa.
Papa can I ask for one thing from you.
This is the thing for asking. lt is your right.
You may ask.
Anu brother.
Come.
Come son.
What a emotional scene is going on between the father and daughter.
Now you see..
..you will take her to U.S. after marriage within few days..
..then I will remain here alone.
That is why I was talking with her alone.
Uncle now there is distance of few hours in the India and U.S.
..whenever we will miss you, will come here.
Excuse me.
Both of you talk and I am coming to attend the phone.
Anu is my elder brother and he is living in Canada with aunty.
Her aunty.
Actually my dad had two marriages..
..and Anu brother is from the first marriage.
After death dad had married to my mother.
In fact Anu brother is more than my own brother for me.
And you want that he should come in our marriage.
Right.
So it's a few days and after marriage you will be in U.S.
So where is your hero. I never see him.
You need my approval.
Of course.
You meet him at any time to tell papa.
Yes.
I can not talk him so openly.
Why?
Brother this is India and not Canada.
Seriously.
You keep this now and come with me.
Where.
To see the shopping.
If I will not show my all the clothes and jewellary..
..then whom I will show.
Come.
See this is my wedding dress.
Nice?
Very good.
Why don't u show to your friends?
I have already shown them and now I am sharing with you.
There was a friend to you and her name is Rani.
My friend or your girl friend?
Her marriage is fixed with Satinder.
Brother, she waited for you for long.
Dadi how are you.
What you kept on your head.
You can not make faces like the human being.
Your Rani like me like this.
Take this henna. lt's real.
Apply on your hair to adorn yourself.
You are looking wicked but you are good by heart.
Dadi Rani is inside.
Yes.
I am coming to meet her.
Well when you will do marriage.
I am going to ask the same.
You.
- Today you don't refuse.
- You have become mad.
Move.
My phone is ringing.
Hello.
- Hello, witch.
To the same place where we meet in childhood.
What you came back.
Oh my God I can not believe this.
You stay here. I am coming right away O.K. oh my God.
Where are you going.
To meet Anu.
He came after a long time.
You can not go like this.
Why.
Because you are my engaged wife..
..and shall I ask you what is your relation with him.
I don't want to share my relation with Anu with you.
Understand.
Now get aside.
Listen Rani if you went like this then our relation is finished.
Satender who else is therefore me..
..and if you will break up this relation then who will marry to me.
Do you really think that I am going to say this to you.
And so far as this relation is concerned..
then take this and wear to some one.
Bye.
What are you doing.
Control.
You are now engaged.
I have broken that relation.
What.
Yes.
- When.
- Just now.
I always love you Anu.
But now so many years have gone..
..and all were telling that you will never come back here.
Then for the happiness of the grand mother I agreed for the marriage.
But thanks God that you came back here.
But if you would have come after wedding then also I went with you.
What are you thinking.
I am thinking about Anu.
What you think that he came here for the marriage of Shruti.
Then.
You are the owner of 100 ackre land..
but in fact if you see then he is also the fifty percent share
..holder of your property.
He is your brother.
You be aware.
Be careful.
He's not as simple as he looks.
I think so. lt's up to you now.
Give it to me.
You don't look nice doing all this.
Really?
You know what she was telling about you.
- No.
What.
- Let her speak.
No no.
Why not?
That you are very handsome.
Anu you do the work.
Yes.
And shall I tell something about you.
No no.
What you people were telling.
That you are from Canada.
Have u been there?
Some wants to come?
- No.
- Actually she was saying st else.
Yes.
- What?
You were smiling and talking with those girls.
. what are you watching.
Papa is calling.
Dad you called me.
For me.
My son there is a life which is passing..
..and other is just passing.
Here is one more life which is neither passing.
Only prey.
No no I don't think that he came here with this intension.
But I think and I can not share this property with any body.
And that too with the man who is nothing to us.
I don't know whenever I look that man I feel insecure.
I did second marriage so that..
..you will get the love of mother again..
but you and your mom can never accept to each other.
The situation getting out of my control..
and then you went to Canada to your aunty.
Don't worry I am here and nothing will happen like this.
Shruti will be married in one or two days and he will go from here.
Come on and don't be so serious now.
Relax.
And during these 15 years..
..I missed you a lot.
Dad its all in the past.
Dad this time..
I will eliminate all the distances the heart.
You are really looking so nice.
Shall we go now?
You are really looking so nice.
Come I will pray for you.
You are really looking so nice.
Don't worry.
I.
V has told everything to us.
Now you see I never supported l.V.
..but in front of love I have to surrender.
Don't worry.
Your parents will want the same.
Two lovers can't be stopped.
So we've arranged everything.
You will marry in court tomorrow.
Who said I want to marry him?
What?
What are you doing, child?
You?
And you have kidnapped me.
You all are mad.
You thought I will get scared.
I am not scared.
I won't spare all of you.
You all are mad.
I will get you jailed.
Bhabhi listen.
Stop.
Where r u going?
Get away.
Please stop.
Leave me.
Shurit ji listen to me.
And come in.
we have brought you with so difficulty.
Everything will be wrong.
Leave me.
No.
- Come inside.
Open the door.
We did mistake sir.
We have brought her against her desire.
We have done kidnapping.
Understand.
Open.
Now if this girl goes from here..
..then no one can stop us from going in the jail.
But how long we will keep her here in this condition.
I know that you can never do any work properly.
I had lost my mind.
Only god can save us f this trouble.
Open.
Any one there.
I don't think we should waste a single minute.
We should go to the police.
Why kidnapped to the Shruti.
And why we don't know anything.
Her wedding is tomorrow.
This is the problem.
We will not be able to show our faces to any one.
Mummy you don't worry I will find out Shruti.
And this is the small city..
..the kidnappers would not be able to keep her for long time.
I don't think that we should go to the police.
If we go to the police then the matter will spread..
..and we will be defamed.
Infact I think we should not tell this to..
..the Raj also for the time being.
This is very complicated issue and we are taking it lightly.
Shurti has been kidnapped and we can not take of a reputation.
We have to think about her.
Shuri has been kidnapped in the morning and now it is evening.
Where she is in what condition we don't know.
Anything can happen with her.
This is a mad house.
How I should go out.
Today is my marriage and because of you my marriage is...
Mother help!
Goddess help.
I have decided.
What.
I will leave the job as you will die and you will kill to me also.
Shut up.
This was your idea only and now you are talking to leave the job.
Papa correctly said that I am idiot.
I never thought about this problem.
All are in trouble in the house because of me.
Brother you don't worry.
I have an idea in my mind.
You are totally fool.
Then O.K.
Tell me.
This is difficult but you have to do it.
Tell me.
Tell me.
Don't talk in riddles.
Tell me clearly.
Brother the girl is alone in the house and you go straight in the house and get your love.
Desperate times call for desperate means.
Understand?
Once a girl accepts someone as her own..
..she hands her life to him.
Why.
Don't understand.
Brother you go in and rape her.
Are you hurt?
First you hit then you ask.
Can I do it?
Where are you going.
Where are you going.
Leave.
Where are you running.
Come in.
Leave.
Leave me.
What are you doing.
Stop.
Calm down.
What happened to her?
God, evil spirit has possessed her.
I am a soul.
He'll come!
I will kill you.
No no.
I will kill.
Hey, the spirit is hungry.
You have identified the face of any one.
No.
The face looked stern.
Do you know to this boy.
Uncle Batosh is fighting with Raj.
What?
I will not leave.
You are talking nonsense about my sister.
What is this going on.
What is this.
He's insolent not me.
He is telling Shruti has gone with some one.
Leave him.
What is w rong with him.
I am in tension.
There is resection in the U.S. and there is no security.
I came here for 15 days and only 3 days are left now.
There is no chance of extension also.
I can not loose my job on this way.
I don't know what is the problem in your family.
I have to go back.
I am sorry.
The same happen for which we fearing.
You should keep patience.
You know that we are going on through so much problem.
What are you telling.
All this..
No.
Baba come.
Where is soul.
Where is gone.
Where is soul.
Why did you call me?
No spirit can confront me.
Spirit!
You can't face me.
Spirit!
Come out.
Today you have to come out.
What are you doing. I said stop it.
Leave.
Brother what are you doing.
Leave it he is torturing.
Who is this man interfering in my work.
He's spreading blind faith.
Get out from here.
Jaggi get him out.
Let's go.
He insulted to us.
Take this too.
Dad, you too.
- No.
Gaggi has given this idea.
This is very bad.
The where about of my sister is not known.
See don't mind it.
You have no value in your house.
Anu become hero here to come from foreign.
Where are you?
I don't know to purchase the clothes of the girls.
But whatever I understand I brought it.
Hope you like it.
Stupid no one loves like this.
I've pleaded to God for you.
You are different from everyone else.
I've pleaded to God for you.
You are different from everyone else.
You are delicate.
What can I say to praise you?
You are like flowers and dews.
I've pleaded to God for you.
You are different from everyone else.
I've pleaded to God for you.
You are different from everyone else.
Eyes are alluring.
My sweetheart, you're my soul.
You are in moonlight.
You are in the sun rays.
You are my rainbow.
I've pleaded to God for you.
You are different from everyone else.
You are not doing anything but doing everything in dream.
Come.
Will you stand here?
Come.
Where is Anu?
Where is Anu.
What is this joke.
Joke this is not joke but the suffocation.
I am getting suffocation inside.
She is my sister and I am not getting pain.
But no one is asking me.
No one tells what is going on.
But who is he that showing so much love to her.
He tries to be a hero.
As if I am useless.
See my son.
Come in.
Oh God what is this happening in my house.
We are suffering from such a problem and this he is...
See I have already lost my daughter and now if she comes back then her honour will not be back.
But now I don't want to loose my son.
I have no problem with Anu but until he will be here my son will live like this.
I think mom is correctly speaking.
I think mom is correctly speaking.
I don't want that there may be any problem in this house because of me.
I think I leave tomorrow.
Driver stop the car.
Where are you going.
What are you doing here.
I know everything that what happen yesterday night.
I know that you have left home.

He said that her step brother is giving much trouble to the police.
You come.
Disgusting and oh God this is become a problem for me.

The man with whom I was going to marry has never given importance to me than his job and whose love I never reccognised has loved more than everything of his life to me.
Now I should not think more.

No this is the reality and not dream.
If this is dream then also so lovely.
Vivek you come out of the world of dreams.
You've the chance today.

You're kidnapping me.
Leave me.

How many years imprisonment will I get?
At least 5-7 years.
Don't do this. I know ministers.
Take him in.
- l'll give you money.
Listen.
Sir, please. I'll give you money.
When I was younger
I wanted to be a priest.
I was going into battle to save men's souls from the evil of the world.
But as I got older,
I saw the world for what it really was.
It wasn't so much who I was going to save, but who was gonna save the world from me.

Are you eye-fucking me, boy?
No, dog.
My man in the warden's office says they gonna be putting your ass back in general next week.
Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.
Fuck you, nigger.

You's a real tough motherfucker now, huh?
That's why they got your ass over there in C-block.

Who's a bitch now, you motherfucker?
You want to run your mouth now, nigger?

I need to warm up.
I was just remembering the first time
Dave ever met my pop.
Dude, I thought he was gonna shit himself.
You remember that?
You were stuttering.
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.
Nah, he was just all talk.
All talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Fucking freezing.
Hey, man, hey.
You know why I love being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.
Like no problems pressing down on my shoulders.
Hey, like if you need counseling, I've got you covered.

Man, fuck the holidays, dude.
Lighten up, man.
Come on, bro, relax.
We love you, man.

You, shut the fuck up!

Get the fuck in!
Dude, let's go.
Let's fucking get out of here!
We've got to fucking go, man!
Come on.
Fuck, come on.
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
Let's go!
Let's go!
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
So how you been, Sonny?
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
Drive around the block.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-
- It's open, Vincent.
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
Wrong answer.
Oh, come on.
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Bring him up.
Oh, mother of God!
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
--I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
Hey.
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- Move!
Watch out.
Fuck!
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
You got off easy, motherfucker.
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
He was loyal.
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.

Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
Let's go!
Let's go!
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
So how you been, Sonny?
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
Drive around the block.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-
- It's open, Vincent.
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
Wrong answer.
Oh, come on.
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Bring him up.
Oh, mother of God!
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
--I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
Hey.
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- Move!
Watch out.
Fuck!
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
You got off easy, motherfucker.
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
He was loyal.
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

When I was younger
I wanted to be a priest.
I was going into battle to save men's souls from the evil of the world.
But as I got older,
I saw the world for what it really was.
It wasn't so much who I was going to save, but who was gonna save the world from me.

Hey, Sonny.
How are you doing?
Hey Dave, can you quarterback for us?
Can't, man.
I've got to go.
Yo, man, you just moved in here a week ago.
How the fuck does everybody know your name already?
- Why you always riding him?
- it's a gift.
I'm blessed with an outstandingly magnetic personality.
Big fucking mouth you mean.
Okay, Mr. Antisocial.
Next time you're standing next to some chick trying to get laid, you're gonna need my big mouth.
Yeah.
The day I need you to help me get laid--
I see the way your woman looks at me.
Are you eye-fucking me, boy?
No, dog.
My man in the warden's office says they gonna be putting your ass back in general next week.
Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.
Fuck you, nigger.
Anytime.
You's a real tough motherfucker now, huh?
That's why they got your ass over there in C-block.
That's where they keep all the bitches and snitches.
Which one you be?
Hey!
You got something to say now, nigger?
Who's a bitch now, you motherfucker?
You want to run your mouth now, nigger?
Come on, I can't hear you.

What, you in a hurry, man?
Pass that shit.
I need to warm up.
I was just remembering the first time
Dave ever met my pop.
Dude, I thought he was gonna shit himself.
You remember that?
You were stuttering.
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.
Nah, he was just all talk.
All talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Fucking freezing.
Hey, man, hey.
You know why I love being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.

Hey, like if you need counseling, I've got you covered.

- Yeah, right.
Man, fuck the holidays, dude.
Lighten up, man.
Come on, bro, relax.

Dude, let's go.
Let's fucking get out of here!

Come on.
Fuck, come on.
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
Let's go!
Let's go!
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
So how you been, Sonny?
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
Drive around the block.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-
- It's open, Vincent.
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
Wrong answer.
Oh, come on.
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Bring him up.
Oh, mother of God!
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
--I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
Hey.
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- Move!
Watch out.
Fuck!
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
You got off easy, motherfucker.
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
He was loyal.
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

When I was younger
I wanted to be a priest.
I was going into battle to save men's souls from the evil of the world.
But as I got older,
I saw the world for what it really was.
It wasn't so much who I was going to save, but who was gonna save the world from me.

Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.

Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
Dave:
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
Sonny:
That's all you think about.

- Dave:
What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?

Let's go!

As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.

Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
(groaning )
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
(church bells ringing )
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
(grunts)
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
-( laughs )
Happy holidays.
(grunts)
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
( exhales )
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
Petey:
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
(grunts)
Get down.
(mumbling quietly)
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
( knocks )
( knocks )
- ( gunshots on game ) -( knocking )
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
G Money:
So how you been, Sonny?
Sonny:
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
( laughs )
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
( laughs ) They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
- ( gunshot )
- Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
( both groan )
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
G Money:
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
( fabric ripping )
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
( sawing )
( breathing heavily )
(giggling )
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
Sonny's voice:
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
( car starts )
Drive around the block.
( gasps ) Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
( whimpers )
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
( breathes heavily )
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
(crying )
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
( choking )
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
( scoffs )
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
( clock chiming )
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
( sighs )
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
( sighs )
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
( man whispering )
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
( control tower chatter )
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Vincent:
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
( huffs ) All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
( sniffles )
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
( Sobs )
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
Man on P.A.:
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-( knocking )
- It's open, Vincent.
( gasps )
- ( grunts ) - ( screams )
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
( panting )
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
( tisks ) Wrong answer.
(whimpering )
Oh, come on.
( moans )
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
( coughs )
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
( coughs )
( sighs )
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
- ( shatters ) - ( whimpers )
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
( muffled screams )
- Biggs:
Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Tony:
Bring him up.
( sputtering )
Oh, mother of God!
( laughs )
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
( laughs ) You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
-( laughs)
-I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
( laughs )
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
( beeps )
( phone ringing )
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
( sighs )
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
( groans )
Hey.
Sonny's voice:
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
Biggs:
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
John:
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
John:
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
(grunts)
( gunshots )
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- ( tires screech ) -( horn honks )
(grunts)
- Move!
-( pans clatter)
- ( gunshots ) -( people screaming )
Woman:
Watch out.
Fuck!
(dialing )
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
- ( gunshot ) - ( screams )
You got off easy, motherfucker.
(grunts)
( groans )
( Vincent coughing )
( coughing, sputtering )
(coughing )
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
- ( gunshot) - ( groaning )
- He was loyal.
- ( groaning )
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
- ( grunts )
- Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Man:
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
- ( alarm sounding )
- Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.
- How are you doing?
- Hi.
I need you to sign right here.

Can't, man.
I've got to go.
Yo, man, you just moved in here a week ago.
How the fuck does everybody know your name already?
- Why you always riding him?
- it's a gift.
I'm blessed with an outstandingly magnetic personality.
Big fucking mouth you mean.
Okay, Mr. Antisocial.

Dave ever met my pop.
Dude, I thought he was gonna shit himself.
You remember that?
You were stuttering.
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.
Nah, he was just all talk.
All talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Dave:
Fucking freezing.
Dave:
Hey, man, hey.
You know why I love being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.

Hey, like if you need counseling, I've got you covered.

Sonny:
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
Dave:
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
Sonny:
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- Dave:
What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
- ( gunshot)
- Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
( gunshot )
Let's go!
Let's go!
Sonny's voice:
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
( groans )
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
(groaning )
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
(church bells ringing )
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
(grunts)
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
-( laughs )
Happy holidays.
(grunts)
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
( exhales )
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
Petey:
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
(grunts)
Get down.
(mumbling quietly)
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
( knocks )
( knocks )
- ( gunshots on game ) -( knocking )
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
G Money:
So how you been, Sonny?
Sonny:
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
( laughs )
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
( laughs ) They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
- ( gunshot )
- Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
( both groan )
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
G Money:
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
( fabric ripping )
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
( sawing )
( breathing heavily )
(giggling )
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
Sonny's voice:
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
( car starts )
Drive around the block.
( gasps ) Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
( whimpers )
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
( breathes heavily )
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
(crying )
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
( choking )
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
( scoffs )
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
( clock chiming )
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
( sighs )
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
( sighs )
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
( man whispering )
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
( control tower chatter )
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Vincent:
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
( huffs ) All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
( sniffles )
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
( Sobs )
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
Man on P.A.:
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-( knocking )
- It's open, Vincent.
( gasps )
- ( grunts ) - ( screams )
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
( panting )
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
( tisks ) Wrong answer.
(whimpering )
Oh, come on.
( moans )
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
( coughs )
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
( coughs )
( sighs )
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
- ( shatters ) - ( whimpers )
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
( muffled screams )
- Biggs:
Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Tony:
Bring him up.
( sputtering )
Oh, mother of God!
( laughs )
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
( laughs ) You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
-( laughs)
-I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
( laughs )
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
( beeps )
( phone ringing )
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
( sighs )
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
( groans )
Hey.
Sonny's voice:
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
Biggs:
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
John:
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
John:
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
(grunts)
( gunshots )
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- ( tires screech ) -( horn honks )
(grunts)
- Move!
-( pans clatter)
- ( gunshots ) -( people screaming )
Woman:
Watch out.
Fuck!
(dialing )
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
- ( gunshot ) - ( screams )
You got off easy, motherfucker.
(grunts)
( groans )
( Vincent coughing )
( coughing, sputtering )
(coughing )
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
- ( gunshot) - ( groaning )
- He was loyal.
- ( groaning )
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
- ( grunts )
- Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Man:
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
- ( alarm sounding )
- Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.
- How are you doing?
- Hi.
I need you to sign right here.

I wanted to be a priest.
I was going into battle to save men's souls from the evil of the world.
But as I got older,
I saw the world for what it really was.
It wasn't so much who I was going to save, but who was gonna save the world from me.

How the fuck does everybody know your name already?
- Why you always riding him?

Okay, Mr. Antisocial.
Next time you're standing next to some chick trying to get laid, you're gonna need my big mouth.
Yeah.
The day I need you to help me get laid--

Are you eye-fucking me, boy?
No, dog.
My man in the warden's office says they gonna be putting your ass back in general next week.
Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.

Dave ever met my pop.
Dude, I thought he was gonna shit himself.
You remember that?
You were stuttering.
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.
Nah, he was just all talk.
All talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Fucking freezing.
Hey, man, hey.
You know why I love being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.
Like no problems pressing down on my shoulders.
Hey, like if you need counseling, I've got you covered.
- But can I have the bottle?
- Yeah, right.
Man, fuck the holidays, dude.
Lighten up, man.
Come on, bro, relax.
We love you, man.
Come on, hug it out.
Rrr.
Dude, get the fuck off of me, man.
I knew he wasn't going for that.
Come on, let's bounce.
We've got work tomorrow.
♪ I won't fade out, I won't back down ♪
I We're gonna raise up from the underground ♪
♪ Now sing it with me now, say it with me loud ♪
♪ I'm not going to fade... ♪
We got to turn this shit off.
it's annoying.
Hey, man, what time is it?
Five minutes past the last time you asked me, man.
Chill the fuck out.
He's late, man.
Yeah.
- Shit, there he is.
- Let's do this.
Get out.
Stay on the ground or I'll kill you.
Don't make me break this fucking window.
Get down!
Come here, sweetheart.
Come here.
- Don't shoot.
I'm just a courier.
- You shut the fuck up.
I'm just a courier.
Don't kill me.
- Take it, take it.
Don't hurt me.
- Shut up!
- Don't shoot!
- Quit looking at me.
You, shut the fuck up!
Don't shoot!
I'm just a courier!
Let's go, let's go!
Let's fucking get out of here!
Come on, let's go.
Get the fuck in here!
We've gotta move!
Come on!
Get in here!
Get the fuck in!
Dude, let's go.
Let's fucking get out of here!
We've got to fucking go, man!
Come on.
Fuck, come on.
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
Let's go!
Let's go!
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
So how you been, Sonny?
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
Drive around the block.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-
- It's open, Vincent.
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
Wrong answer.
Oh, come on.
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Bring him up.
Oh, mother of God!
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
--I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
Hey.
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- Move!
Watch out.
Fuck!
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
You got off easy, motherfucker.
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
He was loyal.
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

When I was younger
I wanted to be a priest.
I was going into battle to save men's souls from the evil of the world.
But as I got older,
I saw the world for what it really was.
It wasn't so much who I was going to save, but who was gonna save the world from me.
No friends, no jokes, no money
Try to shove me when I'm working my shit
I'll be bringing 'em out, I'm cool
Can't take shit from me in the street
When they come with that beef you know what I'm about...
- How is he?
- He's holding up.
You got to know he appreciates you coming to visit.
Yeah, I know, man.
It's just hard seeing your old man sitting in a fucking cage.
Let's roll.
Standing out in the rain
I never thought this is where I'd be...
Jesus, what is with all these girlie magazines?
I mean really, do you need all this?
- Yeah, I do.
- "10 ways 10 better ways to be a better kisser. "
- Shut up.
"10 things you don't know about him. "
Come on, hit me harder.
Hit me, come on.
You can't hurt the man of steel.
Come on, honey.
I need them.
- Okay.
Is the man of steel gonna finish taking the boxes out of the garage or what?
- Okay.
- Ooh.
I love you.
I've got to go.
I love you.
I've got to go.
Hey.
Come home soon.
Yeah.
Hey, Sonny.
How are you doing?
Hey Dave, can you quarterback for us?
Can't, man.
I've got to go.
Yo, man, you just moved in here a week ago.
How the fuck does everybody know your name already?
- Why you always riding him?
- it's a gift.
I'm blessed with an outstandingly magnetic personality.
Big fucking mouth you mean.
Okay, Mr. Antisocial.
Next time you're standing next to some chick trying to get laid, you're gonna need my big mouth.
Yeah.
The day I need you to help me get laid-
I see the way your woman looks at me.
Are you eye-fucking me, boy?
No, dog.
My man in the warden's office says they gonna be putting your ass back in general next week.
Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.
Fuck you, nigger.
Anytime.
You's a real tough motherfucker now, huh?
That's why they got your ass over there in C-block.
That's where they keep all the bitches and snitches.
Which one you be?
Hey!
You got something to say now, nigger?
Who's a bitch now, you motherfucker?
You want to run your mouth now, nigger?
Come on, I can't hear you.
Come on, motherfucker.
Run your mouth.
I'll fuck you anytime, man.
- Any fucking time.
- Shut up!
Keep your mouth shut.
Keep your mouth shut.
Hey, general population, I'll see you there.
Hey, you gonna nurse that bottle or are you gonna drink it?
What, you in a hurry, man?
Pass that shit.
I need to warm up.
I was just remembering the first time
Dave ever met my pop.
Dude, I thought he was gonna shit himself.
You remember that?
You were stuttering.
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir. "
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.
Nah, he was just all talk.
All talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Fucking freezing.
Hey, man, hey.
You know why I love being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.
Like no problems pressing down on my shoulders.
Hey, like if you need counseling, I've got you covered.
- But can I have the bottle?
- Yeah, right.
Man, fuck the holidays, dude.
Lighten up, man.
Come on, bro, relax.
We love you, man.
Come on, hug it out.
Rrr.
Dude, get the fuck off of me, man.
I knew he wasn't going for that.
Come on, let's bounce.
We've got work tomorrow.

I We're gonna raise up from the underground
Now sing it with me now, say it with me loud
I'm not going to fade...

Hey, man, what time is it?
Five minutes past the last time you asked me, man.
Chill the fuck out.
He's late, man.
Yeah.

Stay on the ground or I'll kill you.
Don't make me break this fucking window.
Get down!

Get the fuck in!
Dude, let's go.
Let's fucking get out of here!
We've got to fucking go, man!
Come on.
Fuck, come on.
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that-
Look, I just- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
Let's go!
Let's go!
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
So how you been, Sonny?
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store-
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt. "
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man- hit it, would you?
- is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
Drive around the block.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't
- I didn't say- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I
- I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
- I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for-
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
- to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right-
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
- It's open, Vincent.
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
Wrong answer.
Oh, come on.
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary- blood.
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Bring him up.
Oh, mother of God!
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
- I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal-
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- Move!
Watch out.
Fuck!
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
You got off easy, motherfucker.
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what-
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave-
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
He was loyal.
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't- I needed all the money.
They were gonna- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
- I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.
- How are you doing?
- Hi.
I need you to sign right here.
How do you want to be remembered?
For your honor
Or your pride?
How do you want to be remembered?
For you body
Or your mind?
A man once said an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.
As I was not my brother's keeper, neither was I his killer.
I could live with the fact that Vincent was still alive.
The question was, could he?
Time is on my side
And still the world continues to turn
And as I think about the things that I've learned
I see that money's worth less
With every dollar I earned
And in the end I'd rather choose to fade than burn
Sometimes you pay the price
For flying close to the sun
But that's why youth is wasted on the young
I think of all the things that I've done
All the ghosts in my past
Will my reputation live, will it crumble and crash?
As I dream I see a vision of an angel who asks
Why'd I die young and leave a pretty face in the casket?
Ain't no fashion here, we don't take plastic
We don't give a damn how many chips you cashed in
With ashes I'm waiting at the entrance to heaven
Without a legacy, why should they show me acceptance?
Though she doesn't speak
I hear the words of her lessons
And as she sings, she haunts me
With the simplest of questions, she says
How do you want to be remembered?
For your anger
Or your love?
How do you want to be remembered?
For your beauty
Or your blood?
How do you want to be remembered?
For your actions
Or your words?
Too big a sacrifice
How do you want to be remembered?
For your silence
Or your voice?
Leave a legacy.
{ horn blows }
Man's voice:
When I was younger
I wanted to be a priest.
I was going into battle to save men's souls from the evil of the world.
But as I got older,
I saw the world for what it really was.
It wasn't so much who I was going to save, but who was going to save the world from me.

Hey Dave, can you quarterback for us?
Can't, man.
I've got to go.
Yo, man, you just moved in here a week ago.
How the fuck does everybody know your name already?
- Why you always riding him?
- it's a gift.
I'm blessed with an outstandingly magnetic personality.
Big fucking mouth you mean.
Okay, Mr. Antisocial.
Next time you're standing next to some chick trying to get laid, you're going to need my big mouth.
Yeah.
The day I need you to help me get laid--
I see the way your woman looks at me.

{ cell doors clanking }
{ men shouting in distance }
Are you eye-fucking me, boy?
No, dog.
My man in the warden's office says they going to be putting your ass back in general next week.
Then it's going to be on, motherfucker.
Fuck you, nigger.
Anytime.
You's a real tough motherfucker now, huh?
That's why they got your ass over there in C-block.
That's where they keep all the bitches and snitches.
Which one you be?
{ alarm ringing }
Hey!
You got something to say now, nigger?
Who's a bitch now, you motherfucker?
You want to run your mouth now, nigger?
Come on, I can't hear you.
Come on, motherfucker.
Run your mouth.
I'll fuck you anytime, man.
- Any fucking time.
- Guard:
Shut up!
Keep your mouth shut.
Keep your mouth shut.
Hey, general population, I'll see you there.
Hey, you going to nurse that bottle or are you going to drink it?
What, you in a hurry, man?
Pass that shit.
I need to warm up.
I was just remembering the first time
Dave ever met my pop.
Dude, I thought he was going to shit himself.
You remember that?
You were stuttering.
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.
Nah, he was just all talk.
All talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Dave:
Fucking freezing.
Dave:
Hey, man, hey.
You know why I love being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.
Like no problems pressing down on my shoulders.
Hey, like if you need counselling, I've got you covered.
- But can I have the bottle?
- Yeah, right.
Man, fuck the holidays, dude.
Lighten up, man.
Come on, bro, relax.
We love you, man.
Come on, hug it out.
Rrr.
Dude, get the fuck off of me, man.
{ laughing } I knew he wasn't going for that.
Come on, let's bounce.
We've got work tomorrow.
¶¶ I won't fade out, I won't back down ¶¶
I We're going to raise up from the underground ¶¶
¶¶ Now sing it with me now, say it with me loud ¶¶
¶¶ I'm not going to fade... ¶¶
We got to turn this shit off.
it's annoying.
Hey, man, what time is it?
Five minutes past the last time you asked me, man.
Chill the fuck out.
He's late, man.
Yeah.
- Shit, there he is.
- Let's do this.
{ tires squeal }
{ tires squeal }
{ woman screams }
{ people clamouring, screaming }
Get out.
Stay on the ground or I'll kill you.
Don't make me break this fucking window.
Get down!
Come here, sweetheart.
Come here.
- Don't shoot.
I'm just a courier.
- You shut the fuck up.
I'm just a courier.
Don't kill me.
- Take it, take it.
Don't hurt me.
- Shut up!
- Don't shoot!
- Quit looking at me.
You, shut the fuck up!
Don't shoot!
I'm just a courier!
{ shrieks }
Let's go, let's go!
Let's fucking get out of here!
Come on, let's go.
Get the fuck in here!
- { sirens approaching }
- We've got to move!
Come on!
Get in here!
Get the fuck in!
Dude, let's go.
Let's fucking get out of here!
We've got to fucking go, man!
Come on.
Fuck, come on.
Sonny:
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favour.
A favour?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favours', all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why I did what I did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
Dave:
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
Sonny:
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- Dave:
What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
- { gunshot}
- Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
{ gunshot }
Let's go!
Let's go!
Sonny's voice:
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
{ groans }
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're going to need this.
Here.
'Cause this is going to pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It isn't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was going to go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
{groaning }
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You going to be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
{church bells ringing }
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not going to be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
-{ laughs }
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm going to find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're going to come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I isn't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're going to take it out of the ground tonight and you're going to take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm going to send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
{ exhales }
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're going to sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're going to run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homier?
And where you going to be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
Petey:
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
{mumbling quietly}
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still going to shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just going to leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's going to know I got $2 million in my car?
{ knocks }
{ knocks }
- { gunshots on game } -{ knocking }
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you going to ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
G Money:
So how you been, Sonny?
Sonny:
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
{ laughs }
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This isn't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialled up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There isn't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
{ laughs } They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
- { gunshot }
- Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This isn't going to be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we going to take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I isn't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
{ both groan }
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I isn't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
G Money:
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbours.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we going to do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
{ fabric ripping }
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
{ sawing }
{ breathing heavily }
{giggling }
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
Sonny's voice:
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
{ car starts }
Drive around the block.
{ gasps } Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
{ whimpers }
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
{ breathes heavily }
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
{crying }
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was going to get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you going to do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you going to do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
{ choking }
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm going to handle it.
{ scoffs }
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
{ clock chiming }
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
{ sighs }
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
{ sighs }
Now they say that they're going to stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you going to get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
{ man whispering }
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
{ control tower chatter }
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Vincent:
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but isn't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're going to whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I isn't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
{ huffs } All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm going to deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
{ sniffles }
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
{ Sobs }
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you going to be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
Man on P.A.:
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-{ knocking }
- It's open, Vincent.
{ gasps }
- { grunts } - { screams }
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
{ panting }
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
{ tisks } Wrong answer.
{whimpering }
Oh, come on.
{ moans }
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
{ coughs }
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
{ coughs }
{ sighs }
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
- { shatters } - { whimpers }
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
{ muffled screams }
- Biggs:
Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not going to plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Tony:
Bring him up.
{ sputtering }
Oh, mother of God!
{ laughs }
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God isn't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
{ laughs } You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fucking' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
-{ laughs}
-I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
{ laughs }
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm going to go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
{ beeps }
{ phone ringing }
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're going to have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's going to stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
{ sighs }
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
{ groans }
Hey.
Sonny's voice:
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
Biggs:
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I isn't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're going to be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
John:
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
John:
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
{ gunshots }
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- { tires screech } -{ horn honks }
- Move!
-{ pans clatter}
- { gunshots } -{ people screaming }
Woman:
Watch out.
Fuck!
{dialling }
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
- { gunshot } - { screams }
You got off easy, motherfucker.
{ groans }
{ Vincent coughing }
{ coughing, sputtering }
{coughing }
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
- { gunshot} - { groaning }
- He was loyal.
- { groaning }
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were going to-- they were going to kill my father.
- What?
- They were going to kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've got to tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You isn't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm going to walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
- { grunts }
- Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Man:
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
- { alarm sounding }
- Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.
- How are you doing?
- Hi.
I need you to sign right here.

Sonny:
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.

Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.

Five million.
See, now you see why I did what I did, man.
I got y'aIIs back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'aII wait here?
Dave:
$5 miIIion, man.
I can take care of my girl.
Sonny:
That's all you think about.
valerie this, valerie that.
- Dave:
What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
- ( gunshot )
- Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- l'm sorry, bro.
( gunshot )
Let's go!
Let's go!
Sonny's voice:
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
( groans )
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, Iet me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
( groaning )
Oh shit.
Shit.
hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
hold that there.
hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- l got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'II bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- AII right?
- All right.
( church bells ringing )
Do you want to talk about it?
talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 miIIion will buy you a Iot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- l'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
( grunts )
AII right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer. I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
- ( laughs )
Happy holidays.
( grunts )
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
AII right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-caIIed friend.
He shot me.
- l'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- ls that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, Iaundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'II let them dig it up.
( exhaIes )
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst.
Petey:
AII right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
( grunts )
Get down.
( mumbling quietly )
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, Iet's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
AII right.
AII right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
( knocks )
- ( gunshots on game ) - ( knocking )
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'aII come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
G Money:
So how you been, Sonny?
Sonny:
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
( laughs )
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snakeweed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
( laughs ) They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
- ( gunshot )
- Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- AII right.
- help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
( both groan )
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
AII right, all right.
hold on.
AII right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
G Money:
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
AII right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
AII right?
Grab his legs.
help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
( fabric ripping )
Hmm.
AII right.
( sawing )
( breathing heavily )
( giggling )
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
Sonny's voice:
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well...
let's just say there's a reason I'II never eat a hamburger again.
( car starts )
Drive around the block.
( gasps ) Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
( whimpers )
please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
( breathes heavily )
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
I-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
( crying )
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I couId move $5 miIIion in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
people don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave hall.
- Dave hall!
Dave hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my Iong-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
( choking )
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
( scoffs )
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
( clock chiming )
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
( sighs )
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I Iike reading the box scores.
I Iike seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
( sighs )
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'II tell you what it is-- unciviIized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- AII right.
will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
( man whispering )
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of Iife at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
( control tower chatter )
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Vincent:
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
- l need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
people that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'II ever meet.
You know what happened
- to the Iast guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a cIosed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
( huffs ) AII right.
And I'II tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
( sniffIes )
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
( sobs )
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'II make it better.
Long time.
only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, Iet's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, Iet's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
AII right, all right.
- ls he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'II always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
Man on P.A.:
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
AII cashiers please come to the front.
AII cashiers to the front.
- ( knocking )
- It's open, Vincent.
( gasps )
- ( grunts ) - ( screams )
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
( panting )
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
( tisks ) Wrong answer.
( whimpering )
Oh, come on.
( moans )
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
( coughs )
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
( coughs )
( sighs )
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
- ( shatters ) - ( whimpers )
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'II get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, Iike a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
( muffled screams )
- Biggs:
Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Tony:
Bring him up.
( sputtering )
Oh, mother of God!
( laughs )
Hey, aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
( laughs ) You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
pull him up.
- ( laughs )
- I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
( laughs )
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- will do.
Let's get him.
( beeps )
( phone ringing )
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- It's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
( sighs )
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
( groans )
Hey.
Sonny's voice:
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
Biggs:
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army ofjuvenile deIinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'II go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
AII right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'II take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I couId see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a Iot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steaI--
John:
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
John:
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
( grunts )
( gunshots )
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- ( tires screech ) - ( horn honks )
( grunts )
- Move!
- ( pans cIatter )
- ( gunshots ) - ( people screaming )
Woman:
Watch out.
Fuck!
( dialing )
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'II be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
AII right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'II let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
- ( gunshot ) - ( screams )
You got off easy, motherfucker.
( grunts )
( groans )
( Vincent coughing )
( coughing, sputtering )
( coughing )
Isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my Iife worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
- ( gunshot ) - ( groaning )
- He was loyal.
- ( groaning )
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'II both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'II see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'II find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
- ( grunts )
- Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Man:
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
- ( alarm sounding )
- Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
- I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.
- How are you doing?
- Hi.
I need you to sign right here.

Man's voice:
When I was younger
I wanted to be a priest.
I was going into battle to save men's souls from the evil of the world.
But as I got older,
I saw the world for what it really was.
It wasn't so much who I was going to save, but who was gonna save the world from me.

Boy:
Hey Dave, can you quarterback for us?
Can't, man.
I've got to go.
Yo, man, you just moved in here a week ago.
How the fuck does everybody know your name already?
- Why you always riding him?
- it's a gift.
I'm blessed with an outstandingly magnetic personality.
Big fucking mouth you mean.
Okay, Mr. Antisocial.
Next time you're standing next to some chick trying to get laid, you're gonna need my big mouth.
Yeah.
The day I need you to help me get laid--
I see the way your woman looks at me.

No, dog.
My man in the warden's office says they gonna be putting your ass back in general next week.

Anytime.
You's a real tough motherfucker now, huh?
That's why they got your ass over there in C-block.
That's where they keep all the bitches and snitches.

Dave ever met my pop.
Dude, I thought he was gonna shit himself.
You remember that?
You were stuttering.
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.
Nah, he was just all talk.
All talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Dave:
Fucking freezing.
Dave:
Hey, man, hey.
You know why I love being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.

Hey, like if you need counseling, I've got you covered.

Sonny:
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
Dave:
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
Sonny:
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- Dave:
What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
- ( gunshot)
- Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
( gunshot )
Let's go!
Let's go!
Sonny's voice:
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
( groans )
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
(groaning )
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
(church bells ringing )
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
(grunts)
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
-( laughs )
Happy holidays.
(grunts)
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
( exhales )
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
Petey:
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
(grunts)
Get down.
(mumbling quietly)
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
( knocks )
( knocks )
- ( gunshots on game ) -( knocking )
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
G Money:
So how you been, Sonny?
Sonny:
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
( laughs )
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
( laughs ) They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
- ( gunshot )
- Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
( both groan )
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
G Money:
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
( fabric ripping )
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
( sawing )
( breathing heavily )
(giggling )
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
Sonny's voice:
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
( car starts )
Drive around the block.
( gasps ) Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
( whimpers )
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
( breathes heavily )
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
(crying )
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
( choking )
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
( scoffs )
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
( clock chiming )
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
( sighs )
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
( sighs )
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
( man whispering )
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
( control tower chatter )
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Vincent:
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
( huffs ) All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
( sniffles )
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
( Sobs )
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
Man on P.A.:
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-( knocking )
- It's open, Vincent.
( gasps )
- ( grunts ) - ( screams )
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
( panting )
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
( tisks ) Wrong answer.
(whimpering )
Oh, come on.
( moans )
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
( coughs )
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
( coughs )
( sighs )
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
- ( shatters ) - ( whimpers )
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
( muffled screams )
- Biggs:
Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Tony:
Bring him up.
( sputtering )
Oh, mother of God!
( laughs )
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
( laughs ) You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
-( laughs)
-I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
( laughs )
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
( beeps )
( phone ringing )
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
( sighs )
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
( groans )
Hey.
Sonny's voice:
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
Biggs:
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
John:
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
John:
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
(grunts)
( gunshots )
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- ( tires screech ) -( horn honks )
(grunts)
- Move!
-( pans clatter)
- ( gunshots ) -( people screaming )
Woman:
Watch out.
Fuck!
(dialing )
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
- ( gunshot ) - ( screams )
You got off easy, motherfucker.
(grunts)
( groans )
( Vincent coughing )
( coughing, sputtering )
(coughing )
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
- ( gunshot) - ( groaning )
- He was loyal.
- ( groaning )
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
- ( grunts )
- Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Man:
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
- ( alarm sounding )
- Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.
- How are you doing?
- Hi.
I need you to sign right here.

Man's voice:
When I was younger
I wanted to be a priest.
I was going into battle to save men's souls from the evil of the world.
But as I got older,
I saw the world for what it really was.
It wasn't so much who I was going to save, but who was gonna save the world from me.
d No friends, no jokes, no money d dTry to shove me when I'm working my shit d d I'll be bringing 'em out, I'm cool d d Can't take shit from me in the street d
d When they come with that beef you know what I'm about... d
- How is he?
- He's holding up.
You got to know he appreciates you coming to visit.
Yeah, I know, man.
It's just hard seeing your old man sitting in a fucking cage.
Let's roll.
d Standing out in the rain d d I never thought this is where I'd be... d
Jesus, what is with all these girlie magazines?
I mean really, do you need all this?
- Yeah, I do.
- "10 ways- 10 better ways to be a better kisser."
- Shut up.
"10 things you don't know about him."
Come on, hit me harder.
Hit me, come on.
You can't hurt the man of steel.
Come on, honey.
I need them.
- Okay.
-( horn honks )
Is the man of steel gonna finish taking the boxes out of the garage or what?
- Okay.
- Ooh.
I love you.
I've got to go.
I love you.
I've got to go.
Hey.
Come home soon.
Yeah.
Hey, Sonny.
How are you doing?
Boy:
Hey Dave, can you quarterback for us?
Can't, man.
I've got to go.
Yo, man, you just moved in here a week ago.
How the fuck does everybody know your name already?
- Why you always riding him?
- it's a gift.
I'm blessed with an outstandingly magnetic personality.
Big fucking mouth you mean.
Okay, Mr. Antisocial.
Next time you're standing next to some chick trying to get laid, you're gonna need my big mouth.
Yeah.
The day I need you to help me get laid--
I see the way your woman looks at me.
( buzzer sounds )
( cell doors clanking )
( men shouting in distance )
Are you eye-fucking me, boy?
No, dog.
My man in the warden's office says they gonna be putting your ass back in general next week.
Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.
Fuck you, nigger.
Anytime.
You's a real tough motherfucker now, huh?
That's why they got your ass over there in C-block.
That's where they keep all the bitches and snitches.
Which one you be?
( alarm ringing )
Hey!
You got something to say now, nigger?
Who's a bitch now, you motherfucker?
You want to run your mouth now, nigger?
Come on, I can't hear you.
Come on, motherfucker.
Run your mouth.
I'll fuck you anytime, man.
- Any fucking time.
- Guard:
Shut up!
Keep your mouth shut.
Keep your mouth shut.
Hey, general population, I'll see you there.
Hey, you gonna nurse that bottle or are you gonna drink it?
What, you in a hurry, man?
Pass that shit.
I need to warm up.
I was just remembering the first time
Dave ever met my pop.
Dude, I thought he was gonna shit himself.
You remember that?
You were stuttering.
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.
Nah, he was just all talk.
All talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Dave:
Fucking freezing.
Dave:
Hey, man, hey.
You know why I love being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.
Like no problems pressing down on my shoulders.
Hey, like if you need counseling, I've got you covered.
- But can I have the bottle?
- Yeah, right.
Man, fuck the holidays, dude.
Lighten up, man.
Come on, bro, relax.
We love you, man.
Come on, hug it out.
Rrr.
Dude, get the fuck off of me, man.
( laughing ) I knew he wasn't going for that.
Come on, let's bounce.
We've got work tomorrow.
d I won't fade out, I won't back down d
I We're gonna raise up from the underground d d Now sing it with me now, say it with me loud d d I'm not going to fade... d
We got to turn this shit off.
it's annoying.
Hey, man, what time is it?
Five minutes past the last time you asked me, man.
Chill the fuck out.
He's late, man.
Yeah.
- Shit, there he is.
- Let's do this.
( tires squeal )
( tires squeal )
( woman screams )
( people clamoring, screaming )
Get out.
Stay on the ground or I'll kill you.
Don't make me break this fucking window.
Get down!
Come here, sweetheart.
Come here.
- Don't shoot.
I'm just a courier.
- You shut the fuck up.
I'm just a courier.
Don't kill me.
- Take it, take it.
Don't hurt me.
- Shut up!
- Don't shoot!
- Quit looking at me.
You, shut the fuck up!
Don't shoot!
I'm just a courier!
( shrieks )
Let's go, let's go!
Let's fucking get out of here!
Come on, let's go.
Get the fuck in here!
- ( sirens approaching )
- We've gotta move!
Come on!
Get in here!
Get the fuck in!
Dude, let's go.
Let's fucking get out of here!
We've got to fucking go, man!
Come on.
Fuck, come on.
Sonny:
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
Dave:
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
Sonny:
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- Dave:
What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
- ( gunshot)
- Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
( gunshot )
Let's go!
Let's go!
Sonny's voice:
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
( groans )
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
(groaning )
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
(church bells ringing )
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
(grunts)
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
-( laughs )
Happy holidays.
(grunts)
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
( exhales )
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
Petey:
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
(grunts)
Get down.
(mumbling quietly)
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
( knocks )
( knocks )
- ( gunshots on game ) -( knocking )
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
G Money:
So how you been, Sonny?
Sonny:
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
( laughs )
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
( laughs ) They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
- ( gunshot )
- Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
( both groan )
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
G Money:
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
( fabric ripping )
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
( sawing )
( breathing heavily )
(giggling )
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
Sonny's voice:
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
( car starts )
Drive around the block.
( gasps ) Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
( whimpers )
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
( breathes heavily )
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
(crying )
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
( choking )
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
( scoffs )
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
( clock chiming )
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
( sighs )
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
( sighs )
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
( man whispering )
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
( control tower chatter )
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Vincent:
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
( huffs ) All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
( sniffles )
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
( Sobs )
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
Man on P.A.:
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-( knocking )
- It's open, Vincent.
( gasps )
- ( grunts ) - ( screams )
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
( panting )
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
( tisks ) Wrong answer.
(whimpering )
Oh, come on.
( moans )
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
( coughs )
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
( coughs )
( sighs )
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
- ( shatters ) - ( whimpers )
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
( muffled screams )
- Biggs:
Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Tony:
Bring him up.
( sputtering )
Oh, mother of God!
( laughs )
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
( laughs ) You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
-( laughs)
-I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
( laughs )
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
( beeps )
( phone ringing )
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
( sighs )
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
( groans )
Hey.
Sonny's voice:
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
Biggs:
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
John:
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
John:
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
(grunts)
( gunshots )
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- ( tires screech ) -( horn honks )
(grunts)
- Move!
-( pans clatter)
- ( gunshots ) -( people screaming )
Woman:
Watch out.
Fuck!
(dialing )
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
- ( gunshot ) - ( screams )
You got off easy, motherfucker.
(grunts)
( groans )
( Vincent coughing )
( coughing, sputtering )
(coughing )
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
- ( gunshot) - ( groaning )
- He was loyal.
- ( groaning )
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
- ( grunts )
- Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Man:
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
- ( alarm sounding )
- Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.
- How are you doing?
- Hi.
I need you to sign right here.

Sonny's voice:
A man once said an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.
As I was not my brother's keeper, neither was I his killer.
I could live with the fact that Vincent was still alive.
The question was, could he?

( instrumental music playing )
When I was younger,
I wanted to be a priest.
I was going into battle to save men's souls from the evil of the world.
But as I got older,
I saw the world for what it really was.
It wasn't so much who I was going to save, but who was gonna save the world from me.

You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.

What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why I did what I did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
Let's go!
Let's go!
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No, no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
I promise.
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with an axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Sss!
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
So how you been, Sonny?
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
Yeah, I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of Boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
Shit, where are we gonna take him, man?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something else better to do?
No, no, no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to be ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
As I listened to the butcher rambling on, it hit me-
- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well...
Let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
Drive around the block.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
I-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No, no, no, no.
I swear to God.
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that there wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey, hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him, you give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line, you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good then He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
- I need to talk to you.
I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you, huh.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for-
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
- to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son
before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-
- It's open, Vincent.
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
Wrong answer.
Oh, come on.
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Bring him up.
Oh, mother of God!
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only God today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yes.
- Way outside.
Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
--I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- It's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No, no, no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
Hey.
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
No, no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No, thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
Move!
Watch out.
Fuck!
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
You can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah, right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
You got off easy, motherfucker.
Isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your Ma's?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave, man.
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
He was loyal.
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-
- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
- I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

Yo, man, you just moved in here a week ago.
How the fuck does everybody know your name already?
- Why you always riding him?
- it's a gift.
I'm blessed with an outstandingly magnetic personality.
Big fucking mouth you mean.
Okay, Mr. Antisocial.
Next time you're standing next to some chick trying to get laid, you're gonna need my big mouth.
Yeah.
The day I need you to help me get laid--
I see the way your woman looks at me.
Are you eye-fucking me, boy?
No, dog.
My man in the warden's office says they gonna be putting your ass back in general next week.
Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.
Fuck you, nigger.
Anytime.
You's a real tough motherfucker now, huh?
That's why they got your ass over there in C-block.
That's where they keep all the bitches and snitches.
Which one you be?
Hey!
You got something to say now, nigger?
Who's a bitch now, you motherfucker?
You want to run your mouth now, nigger?
Come on, I can't hear you.
Come on, motherfucker.
Run your mouth.
I'll fuck you anytime, man.
- Any fucking time.
- Shut up!
Keep your mouth shut.
Keep your mouth shut.
Hey, general population, I'll see you there.
Hey, you gonna nurse that bottle or are you gonna drink it?
What, you in a hurry, man?

Dave ever met my pop.
Dude, I thought he was gonna shit himself.
You remember that?

You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.
Nah, he was just all talk.
All talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Fucking freezing.
Hey, man, hey.
You know why I love being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.
Like no problems pressing down on my shoulders.
Hey, like if you need counseling, I've got you covered.
- But can I have the bottle?
- Yeah, right.
Man, fuck the holidays, dude.
Lighten up, man.
Come on, bro, relax.
We love you, man.
Come on, hug it out.
Rrr.
Dude, get the fuck off of me, man.
I knew he wasn't going for that.
Come on, let's bounce.
We've got work tomorrow.
♪ I won't fade out, I won't back down ♪
I We're gonna raise up from the underground ♪
♪ Now sing it with me now, say it with me loud ♪
♪ I'm not going to fade... ♪
We got to turn this shit off.
it's annoying.
Hey, man, what time is it?
Five minutes past the last time you asked me, man.
Chill the fuck out.
He's late, man.
Yeah.
- Shit, there he is.
- Let's do this.
Get out.
Stay on the ground or I'll kill you.
Don't make me break this fucking window.
Get down!
Come here, sweetheart.
Come here.
- Don't shoot.
I'm just a courier.
- You shut the fuck up.
I'm just a courier.
Don't kill me.
- Take it, take it.
Don't hurt me.
- Shut up!
- Don't shoot!
- Quit looking at me.
You, shut the fuck up!
Don't shoot!
I'm just a courier!
Let's go, let's go!
Let's fucking get out of here!
Come on, let's go.
Get the fuck in here!
We've gotta move!
Come on!
Get in here!
Get the fuck in!
Dude, let's go.
Let's fucking get out of here!
We've got to fucking go, man!
Come on.
Fuck, come on.
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
Let's go!
Let's go!
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
So how you been, Sonny?
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
Drive around the block.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-
- It's open, Vincent.
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
Wrong answer.
Oh, come on.
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Bring him up.
Oh, mother of God!
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
--I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
Hey.
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- Move!
Watch out.
Fuck!
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
You got off easy, motherfucker.
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
He was loyal.
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

I saw the world for what it really was.
It wasn't so much who I was going to save, but who was gonna save the world from me.

Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.

Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.

Yeah, I told him.

Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
Let's go!
Let's go!
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
So how you been, Sonny?
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
Drive around the block.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-
- It's open, Vincent.
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
Wrong answer.
Oh, come on.
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Bring him up.
Oh, mother of God!
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
--I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- Move!
Watch out.
Fuck!
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
You got off easy, motherfucker.
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
He was loyal.
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

I'm blessed with an outstandingly magnetic personality.
Big fucking mouth you mean.
Okay, Mr. antisocial.
Next time you're standing next to some chick trying to get laid, you're gonna need my big mouth.
Yeah.
The day I need you to help me get Iaid--
I see the way your woman looks at me.
Are you eye-fucking me, boy?
No, dog.

You remember that?
You were stuttering.
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.

Nah, he was just all talk.
AII talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.

Hey, man, hey.
You know why I Iove being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.
Like no problems pressing down on my shoulders.
Hey, Iike if you need counseling, I've got you covered.

Man, fuck the holidays, dude.
Lighten up, man.
Come on, bro, relax.

You, shut the fuck up!
Don't shoot!

Let's go, let's go!
Let's fucking get out of here!
Come on, let's go.
Get the fuck in here!
We've gotta move!
Come on!
Get in here!
Get the fuck in!
Dude, Iet's go.
Let's fucking get out of here!
We've got to fucking go, man!
Come on.
Fuck, come on.
What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
well, try not to do me anymore fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five miIIy.
- Whoo!
holy shit, that's a Iot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why I did what I did, man.
I got y'aIIs back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'aII wait here?
$5 miIIion, man.
I can take care of my girl.
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- l'm sorry, bro.
Let's go!
Let's go!
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, Iet me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
Oh shit.
Shit.
hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
hold that there.
hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- l got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'II bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- AII right?
- All right.
Do you want to talk about it?
talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 miIIion will buy you a Iot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- l'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
AII right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer. I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
I promise.
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
AII right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-caIIed friend.
He shot me.
- l'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- ls that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, Iaundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'II let them dig it up.
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst.
AII right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, Iet's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
AII right.
AII right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'aII come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
So how you been, Sonny?
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snakeweed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- AII right.
- help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
AII right, all right.
hold on.
AII right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
AII right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
AII right?
Grab his legs.
help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
Hmm.
AII right.
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well...
let's just say there's a reason I'II never eat a hamburger again.
Drive around the block.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
I-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I couId move $5 miIIion in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
people don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave hall.
- Dave hall!
Dave hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my Iong-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I Iike reading the box scores.
I Iike seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'II tell you what it is-- unciviIized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- AII right.
will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of Iife at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
- l need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
people that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'II ever meet.
You know what happened
- to the Iast guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a cIosed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
AII right.
And I'II tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'II make it better.
Long time.
only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, Iet's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, Iet's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
AII right, all right.
- ls he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'II always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
AII cashiers please come to the front.
AII cashiers to the front.
It's open, Vincent.
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
Wrong answer.
Oh, come on.
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'II get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, Iike a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Bring him up.
Oh, mother of God!
Hey, aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
pull him up.
I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- will do.
Let's get him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- It's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
Hey.
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army ofjuvenile deIinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'II go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
AII right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'II take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I couId see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a Iot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steaI--
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
Move!
Watch out.
Fuck!
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'II be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
AII right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'II let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
You got off easy, motherfucker.
Isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my Iife worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
He was loyal.
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'II both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'II see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'II find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
- I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.

Hey Dave, can you quarterback for us?
Can't, man.
I've got to go.
Yo, man, you just moved in here a week ago.
How the fuck does everybody know your name already?
- Why you always riding him?
- it's a gift.
I'm blessed with an outstandingly magnetic personality.
Big fucking mouth you mean.
Okay, Mr. Antisocial.

Are you eye-fucking me, boy?
No, dog.
My man in the warden's office says they gonna be putting your ass back in general next week.
Then it's gonna be on, motherfucker.
Fuck you, nigger.
Anytime.
You's a real tough motherfucker now, huh?
That's why they got your ass over there in C-block.
That's where they keep all the bitches and snitches.
Which one you be?
Hey!
You got something to say now, nigger?
Who's a bitch now, you motherfucker?
You want to run your mouth now, nigger?
Come on, I can't hear you.

You were stuttering.
You were like, "N-n-n-nice to meet you, s-sir."
Fuck you.
Whatever, man.
I don't blame you for being scared, man.
I've been scared of him too.
Could be a mean old son of a bitch.
Nah, he was just all talk.
All talk?
That's all you've been doing is talking.
Start drinking.
- Man, it is cold up here.
- Fucking freezing.
Hey, man, hey.
You know why I love being up here, man?
It's just like being above it all, man.

Hey, like if you need counseling, I've got you covered.

Man, fuck the holidays, dude.

What the fuck's gotten into you, Vince?
Killing that guy wasn't part of the plan.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Nobody was supposed to die, man.
He was fucking laying there.
I had the situation under control.
You think I want that guy out there looking for us trying to put a bullet in my head?
Come on, man.
The way I see it, I was doing you a favor.
A favor?
Well, try not to do me any more fucking favors, all right?
Ladies, ladies.
Look, no kissing on the first date, okay?
Dude, what does that--
Look, I just-- what's done is done, okay?
- We've just got to stick together.
- Yeah.
Stupid.
- Where's your guy?
- He'll be here.
You tell him we'd be down here by the old truck depot?
Yeah, I told him.
- You say down by the river?
- The river, yeah.
Come on now, we've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Let's not fucking fall apart.
Yo, come check it out.
- Five milly.
- Whoo!
Holy shit, that's a lot of ice, man.
Five million.
See, now you see why i did what i did, man.
I got y'alls back.
Here he comes.
Why don't y'all wait here?
$5 million, man.
I can take care of my girl.
That's all you think about.
Valerie this, Valerie that.
- What do you want?
- I'm waiting on that money.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You sure?
Like I got a choice.
Oh!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry, bro.
Let's go!
Let's go!
As I laid gasping for my next breath,
I knew God had given me a second chance.
But I was too stupid to take it.
I was going to get what was mine.
Sonny, what the fuck?
- Fuck!
- He shot me.
- Who shot you?
- Vince, man.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sit down.
- Where'd you get hit?
- Up top.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Oh fuck.
It's lodged in your collarbone.
Get your fucking dirty hands out of there.
Let me have a look.
You got lucky.
Looks like it hit your cross.
Let me get this off.
- My mom gave me that.
- Yeah, I know.
Hold on, you're gonna need this.
Here.
'Cause this is gonna pucker your asshole.
Move this.
Ready?
Oh shit.
It ain't even that deep.
It's fucking burning, man.
I heard something was gonna go down.
I didn't think it was you guys.
What did you hear, Joe?
Come on, let me finish this shit, all right?
Ahh!
Shit!
Fuck, it's in there.
Hold on.
I see the shit.
I feel it.
Oh Shit.
Shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Oh fuck.
Nice, huh?
I'll make a nice tongue stud with that.
I can't believe he shot me, man.
What'd you hear, Joey?
Vince was running his mouth to some connected guys downtown that he's got a big score coming.
Why would he say that?
We never kick back to them.
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to buy some protection.
Hold that there.
Hold that.
Where the fuck are you going?
You need to lay down.
- I got to find him.
- Oh, yeah, genius?
You gonna be walking around in a bloody shirt with a bullet hole in it?
Cops won't be looking for that.
Take that shit off.
Here.
- Listen, you know John R, right?
- Yeah, made guy, runs the card clubs.
Yeah, down on Woodward.
Now I'll bet if someone was to go down there this Friday night, he might run into Vince or someone who knows where he is.
- Thanks, Joey.
- Hey, hold on.
Try not to get your ass shot again, all right?
You need anything, you come back here.
- All right?
- All right.
Do you want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever brought you here.
I'm here to pray for a friend.
Ah.
Is he sick?
No.
He's dead.
Forgive me for asking.
Were you close?
Yeah.
We were like brothers.
Then rest assured he is in a better place now.
How do you know?
You ever been dead before?
There are many paths to God, my son.
I pray that yours will not be too difficult.
- There you are.
- Thank you, sir.
Hey, beautiful lines.
Yeah.
I guess $5 million will buy you a lot of things like that, huh?
You see, my friend, I think we are both looking for the same thing.
I'm not your friend and I'm not looking for anything.
Okay, so let's cut the bullshit, shall we?
You took something from us and we want it back.
And I'm the guy they picked to get it back.
However, if you help us, we are willing to overlook your part in it.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
It only took me two days to find you.
And if I get those stones without your help, we are going to meet again.
Except this time you won't even hear the hammer drop.
Are we clear?
Look, if it was up to my friends you'd be dead already.
But I'm a patient man.
You've got one week, huh?
It was very nice meeting you.
Oh, hey, ladies.
How's it going?
What you guys up to tonight?
Oh come on, don't be like that.
Could you get that door for me, big man?
Sure, no problem.
Why don't you stop playing like such a fucking nit?
- I'm out.
- Shut your trap, you fuck stick.
In fact, take that.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
- Are you robbing us?
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
All right, now let's start over.
Okay, what can we do for you?
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'm looking for Vincent Long.
- Anybody seen him?
- No.
Of course everyone's got amnesia.
But if you get your memory back, tell him an old friend is looking for him, all right?
And now I'm robbing you.
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- How's everything over here?
- Very good.
Okay?
Good.
- All done?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- I just need the check, please.
- Okay.
Here you go.
Slow night tonight, huh?
Yeah well, it pays the bills.
I'm really a singer.
I'm not gonna be here much longer.
And why is that?
Well, I pray every night that God gets me a record contract.
- Does He hear you?
- Of course He does.
I just have to wait my turn.
No no, that's for you.
Thank you.
Good things are coming to you too.
- I promise.
Happy holidays.
You with me?
- You got a name?
- Sonny.
Like in "O what a sunny fucking day we're having?"
Fuck you.
Who are you?
All right, Sonny.
Sleepy-time.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you?
I'm looking for my so-called friend.
He shot me.
- I'm gonna find him.
- So you can shoot him?
Are you retarded?
Are you handicapped?
You think you're gonna come into my town and take down poker games, shoot whoever you want without my permission?
Are you done with your speech?
Take it easy, Petey.
What's the name of the kid that shot you?
Vincent.
Vincent Long.
Vincent Long that runs with John R's crew?
Yeah, he's been hanging around.
Congratulations.
You managed to piss off a very important group of people that I make money with.
That means you owe me now.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Every fucking thing I say is right.
But I'm a fair guy.
You help me out with my problem and I can help you out with your problem.
I'm listening.
I used to know a guy, laundered money for the Russians.
But he had a funny way of counting.
For every $3 he laundered he kept $1 for himself.
Accumulated quite a stack of dollars.
$2 million.
Only problem is the Russians found out about it and chopped both his legs off with a axe.
But they never found the money.
His family buried it with him.
Well, I ain't digging up no motherfucking dead body.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't want you to dig anyone up.
The Russians found out where the money is.
They're gonna take it out of the ground tonight and you're gonna take it from them.
What's in it for me?
Very few men know the exact value of their life.
Now you know what yours is worth.
$2 million.
And just to make sure you bring that money to me,
I'm gonna send Petey along with you.
Get out of here.
Okay, there they are.
Kick back, relax.
We'll let them dig it up.
Hey, you got a plan?
A plan?
Oh yeah, the plan's real complicated.
You're gonna sneak your ass down there and shoot those motherfuckers in the head and grab the money.
Then you're gonna run your ass back up here like a crack nigger at a police funeral.
You down with that, homie?
And where you gonna be at?
Oh, close enough to shoot you in the head if you fuck up.
What's to stop you from shooting me after I bring you the money?
That's what we call a calculated risk.
Ssst
All right, they got it.
- Let's go.
Go get it.
- Shit.
Get down.
Got it.
I get your $2 million and you're still gonna shoot me?
No.
But I can't watch you and drive this car at the same time.
I need that other gun.
Thanks, Sonny.
You're all right.
You've got some balls.
You don't have to worry about your problem now.
Mr. Biggs is a man of his word.
I know you two got off on the wrong foot.
Hey, you did the job, we've got his cash.
Shit, let's celebrate.
Know anyplace where we can get a bag?
I know a few people.
Let me make some phone calls.
Make it happen.
Hey, what's up?
It's Sonny.
Yeah yeah yeah, I know.
Hey, I want to stop by there.
You know, got to get a little something.
All right.
All right, cool.
You're just gonna leave the money in the trunk?
Yeah, why not?
Who the fuck's gonna know I got $2 million in my car?
About time you showed up, man.
Come on, man.
Who this?
G, Petey;
Petey, G.
Is he a cop?
Come on, why you gonna ask me some shit like that?
Shit, nigga, I had to ask.
Y'all come on in.
Damn.
Hey man, the war is over.
Didn't you hear?
Depends on which war you're talking about.
How much you need?
Oh yeah.
I can handle that.
So how you been, Sonny?
Hey, surviving.
What's up with this motherfucker, man?
- That's business.
- Yeah, I can dig it.
I can smell that weed from over here, man.
Ooh, this is that fire.
Now we call this that snake weed.
Got a partner, man, he runs an exotic pet store--
Hey, motherfucker.
What are you doing?
This ain't goddamn "Duck Hunt."
Relax.
I can handle a fucking gun.
I'm quite sure you can handle a gun.
But I just spent $2,000 getting them triggers dialed up.
He's your boy, huh?
Anyway, man, he puts the weed inside of boa constrictors.
- And customs don't check it?
- There ain't nobody dumb enough to put their hand down no goddamn snake's throat.
They're too cheap for the X-rays.
So they just wave them motherfuckers on through.
Holy shit!
- Oh shit.
- This is bad, man.
- Get a towel.
- What?
- Get a towel.
- Why, man?
This motherfucker's dead.
- The fucking guns is loaded?
- Man, do you keep a car in the garage without no gas in it?
You heard me, right?
I told this motherfucker.
I said do not touch the guns.
But he wanted to be the goddamn Lone Ranger and start fucking with shit.
I am not going down for this shit.
Get me something to wrap him up in.
I got two strikes.
This ain't gonna be my third.
- Get me something to wrap him up in.
- Shit, where are we gonna take him?
- I know a guy.
- Is he far?
Motherfucker, you got something better to do?
No no no.
You're right.
- Shit.
- Okay.
Okay.
Man, you ought to ashamed of yourself bringing this crazy white man to my motherfucking house.
- You know that?
- Help me turn him over.
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit.
- All right.
- Help me pick him up.
I ain't fucking with you no more, Sonny.
I am not fucking with you no more.
One, two, three.
- Oh.
- Oh shit.
Damn.
All right, all right.
Hold on.
All right.
What the hell were you feeding this man?
Right, where are the keys?
He's got the keys.
He got the keys?
Well, you get 'em.
I ain't touching him.
Getting my gun.
Don't shoot your dick off, motherfucker.
Okay.
You know I got some nosy-ass neighbors.
All right.
Hey, Sonny man.
Look, bro, you're my boy.
All right?
Love you, man.
But don't come around here no more, all right?
Bad for business, man.
Hey, you're early.
The suits are still here.
- Come around the side in a mo.
- Okay.
All right?
Grab his legs.
Help me get him undressed.
He's a big boy, isn't he?
What are we gonna do with his clothes?
Oh, there's a furnace in the back.
Hmm.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, bring the bin a bit closer.
There we go.
Right.
Did you know there's 207 bones in the human body?
And 27 of those are in the cranium.
Now the average cranial capacity of modern man-- hit it, would you?
--is 1200cc.
And the average cranial capacity of Neanderthal man is 1800cc.
I was just thinking how fascinating that a creature that we think is a primitive caveman actually had 27% more brains than anyone alive today.
As I listened to the butcher rambling on it hit me-- Vince set up the score.
So the driver must have been in on it.
If I found her, I'd be that much closer to him.
As for Petey, well... let's just say there's a reason I'll never eat a hamburger again.
Drive around the block.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, please.
Please take it easy.
This is far enough.
Pull over.
Please don't hurt me.
Shut it off.
- Okay.
- What's your name?
Mia.
You recognize me?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Should I?
An Iranian diamond broker got jacked on the corner of 6th and Santa Fe.
Yeah, that's right.
I didn't get my share.
Where is he?
The blonde guy?
I swear I have not seen him since then.
L-
- I met him through some friends.
He offered me $5,000 to take this guy to a spot.
- Bullshit.
- No no no no.
I swear to God.
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
I did not know that my client was gonna get hurt.
He promised me that that wasn't going to happen.
I swear to God I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.
Please, believe me.
- Mia.
- Yes?
For your sake I hope you're telling the truth.
Oh God.
Gotcha.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
There's no money in the house.
Vincent Long, you know him?
No, I've never heard of him.
Okay, yeah, I know him.
Sit your ass down.
Let's start with who you are.
I'm Russell.
I work for the diamond exchange.
Your friend came to me, asked me if I could move $5 million in uncut stones.
He brought 'em, I paid him.
Done deal.
Everybody got their share.
Not everybody.
Well, obviously.
- What's the girl's angle?
- Mia?
She's my girlfriend.
We needed a driver who wouldn't freak out.
So we planted her at the car service.
Look, I can't help you.
I move diamonds.
That's all I do.
People don't get their share, some guy gets clipped, it's not my fucking problem.
Hey, whoa, hey!
- Dave Hall.
- What?
Say it, Dave Hall.
Say it, God damn it.
- Dave Hall.
- Dave Hall!
Dave Hall.
That wasn't just anybody who got clipped.
That was my long-time friend Dave Hall.
Hey hey, I can help you get Vince.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it won't be easy.
He's got a place he hangs out over on 3rd.
Couple of guys, tough-- real stone killers.
Now when you see him you to give him a message.
Tell him his old friend from high school is looking for him.
Oh, you're kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?
Really?
- Put your arms down.
Come around here.
- Unbelievable.
So what are you gonna do about this guy?
What, no hello?
That's fucking rude.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello.
Now what the fuck are you gonna do about this guy?
He came to my house last night, Vince.
My house.
This is your fuck up.
This was your end of the deal.
- My end?
- Yes.
Now take care of it.
What did you tell him?
What do you mean?
I mean what did you tell him?
Uh, how about not a goddamn thing?
What are you talking about?
Russell, I know how weak you are, so just tell me what you told him.
I didn't-
- I didn't say-- I didn't say anything.
You're still alive.
That means you told him something.
Now I want to know what the fuck it was.
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I told you from the beginning there could be no loose ends, Vince.
You needed money.
I told you how to get it.
Somewhere along the line you fucked up.
These were your friends.
You should have handled it.
Get that shit out of here, Markus.
I-I can't believe we're related.
I fucked this guy for months to make this deal happen.
I never did like the idea of you fucking him.
You know what we had to do, Vince.
Now what about Sonny?
I'm gonna handle it.
How did he look?
How the fuck do you think he looked?
He looked pissed off.
I hope you know what you're doing, Vince.
- Mr. B.
- Yeah, Tony?
You know, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is eating my breakfast and reading the sports page.
I like reading the box scores.
I like seeing who wins, who loses.
It relaxes me.
You know what I mean?
Now they say that they're gonna stop publishing newspapers so people can read the stats and the box scores on their fucking cell phone.
Who wants to look at a cell phone when you're eating food?
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what it is-- uncivilized.
It's a different world.
Same world, different toys.
What do you hear about Petey and the kid?
Nothing yet.
But we grabbed one of the Russians this morning.
Sal's softening him up right now.
All right.
Go take a look.
I'll be down there in a little bit, all right?
- Give me a call if something changes.
- All right.
Will do, boss.
Boss.
What did Petey's mom say?
She hasn't heard anything.
And the sisters, no one's seen him.
This way.
Thanks.
How's it going, Sal?
He tell you anything?
- Not much.
- Hey, Ivan.
Oh.
Hey, buddy.
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing in there?
Sal, this defeats the whole fucking purpose of interrogating him.
How are you gonna get anything out of him if he's dead?
You brought me all the way down here for this?
Now you've got to go get another Russian, all right?
I was hoping I'd see you again, my son.
You can leave the burden of life at the door of God's house.
You really believe all this shit, Father?
I mean, if He made good He also made bad, right?
Do you believe in free will?
The idea that you are free to make your own choice in this world.
Of course.
Then how could you make a choice between right and wrong if God did not offer the two extremes?
The path to God is based upon your ability as a thinking, feeling being to make the correct decisions.
If everything was perfect, then you wouldn't be on earth.
You'd already be in heaven.
You don't live in my world, Father.
God can forgive almost anything, my son.
But you must open your heart to Him.
Aw, Christ.
Back five fucking minutes, I got to deal with this asshole.
Hey, Johnny.
Welcome back.
How was Vegas?
- Hot.
- Yeah?
Yeah, what else you want to know?
-I need to talk to you.
- I heard you got a problem with ghosts.
- Ghosts?
- Yeah.
People that should be dead, but ain't.
What the fuck did I tell you?
If you're gonna whack someone, you put two in the head.
That way they can't come back for you.
- Yeah, I know.
- You know, but you didn't do that, did you?
Now you got problems.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you could help me out.
I already helped you out.
I took care of the cops.
Come on, man, you got a cut.
For protection.
I ain't going to war for you, kid.
- I'm not asking you to go to war for--
- You shut the fuck up.
Listen, that friend of yours, somehow he got Biggs involved.
That changed everything.
This guy don't fuck around.
He's the most ruthless, cold motherfucker you'll ever meet.
You know what happened
-to the last guy who fucked with him?
- No.
Let's just say he got a closed-casket funeral.
I can't do anything on this.
You're on your own.
All right.
And I'll tell you something else.
If Biggs reaches out for me, I'm gonna deliver you.
Just like that?
It's business.
John.
Fuck.
Sonny?
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.
He always said that he'd be okay as long as you were there.
I'll make it better.
Long time.
Only 13 years.
I can't help you.
I didn't come here to ask you for your help.
Well, then why don't you get to it?
They only let me out of my cage for about 15 minutes.
I came to ask is there anything you want me to tell your son before I kill him?
You know, if this glass wasn't between us I'd break your fucking neck
- for talking to me that way!
- The glass is there.
Hey.
Hey!
- That's it, let's go.
- You hear that?
That's it, let's go.
Let's go.
- That's it.
- This crazy motherfucker.
All right, all right.
- Is he here?
- Yeah, but he's busy right--
What the fuck?
Mia.
So you gonna be around later on?
- Yo, Mia, what the fuck?
- Get rid of her.
- Hey.
- What?
Get your shit and get going.
I guess just go.
You're a fucking asshole.
This is why we're in a world of shit, Vincent.
Because you're off fucking around instead of taking care of business.
Calm down.
I'm tying up the loose ends.
Loose ends?
The only fucking loose end is Sonny.
I am telling you, Vincent, do not underestimate him.
I grew up with Sonny.
He's a hothead.
He'll always come through the front door.
Great, so we'll just wait for the doorbell to ring, right?
Mia, enough.
We need a backup register open, please.
Backup register open, please.
This what you want?
All cashiers please come to the front.
All cashiers to the front.
-
- It's open, Vincent.
We're done with the small talk, hmm?
Where are my diamonds?
I sold them.
Wrong answer.
Oh, come on.
So this is fun for you?
Huh?
Want to go again?
You have a lot of nice things here.
Is this all worth it?
Yeah, it is.
Ooh, scary-- blood.
Give me my diamonds and we're done.
Fuck you!
Fuck, man.
I'm starving.
We'll get something on the way back home.
What you in the mood for?
Shit, like a fucking salad.
What the hell?
What's wrong with you, man?
Yo, Mia.
Mia.
Fuck.
Mia?
Fuck.
Oh fuck.
We've got to get the fuck out of here, Vince.
We've got to go.
- Let's go.
- Get off me!
I'm sorry, man.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Frankie, how's it going?
- Nothing, boss.
No one's seen or heard anything.
They must have whacked the both of them.
Listen, you stupid fucking Russian son of a bitch, if you're not gonna plan on growing gills anytime soon,
I'd suggest you tell the man what he wants to know.
Black man took the money.
That's all I see.
He took it.
10 bucks says when he comes up for air he starts screaming about God.
- 20.
- Bet.
Bring him up.
Oh, mother of God!
Hey, Aqualung.
Let me tell you something.
God ain't here.
Okay?
God has left Detroit.
I'm your only god today.
So you'd better tell me what happened to my boy Petey, what happened to the black man, and what happened to my fucking money.
- You hear me?
- Man with gun, he took your money.
He took your money.
I tell the truth.
I tell the truth!
You're a tough son of a bitch.
Back in the pool, Tony.
- You see that game last night?
- Yeah.
It was a ball.
Way outside.
No fucking way that was a strike.
Ump walked to the plate, he couldn't see shit.
- They should use that computer box.
- Yeah.
- Way outside.
- Fuckin' ump is like Mr. fucking Magoo.
He can't see anything.
I think he's drowning, boss.
Pull him up.
--I think he's dead.
I think he was telling the truth.
Listen, come and get me after you clean this up.
- I'm gonna go get a massage.
- Will do.
Let's get him.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm just running a few minutes late.
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- Whatever.
- You're light.
- it's all there.
No it isn't.
You're light.
What the fuck are you trying to say, Saunders?
The warden said the price went up.
No no no.
We had a deal.
Yeah, you paid for a year's worth of protection.
And now you're gonna have to pay more.
You want the old man kept in protective custody?
You pay $100,000 upfront.
This is bullshit.
How long do you think that old man's gonna stay in the general population?
I give him two days before the brothers cut him a new one.
You want that on your head?
I know you're about family, so do the right thing, Vince.
Be the good son.
You'd better think this through before you pull that trigger.
You fuck up with us and your old man's a stain on the floor.
Got it?
You got 24 hours.
Or we feed him to the animals.
Get out.
Mia's dead.
What do you want me to say?
Say fucking something.
Anything.
There's nothing to say.
You don't even want to know how?
It doesn't fucking matter.
You're out there making mistake after mistake.
And you wonder why she's dead?
What am I doing wrong?
Well, Sonny for one.
How do you know about Sonny?
He came to visit me.
He sat right where you're sitting right now on the other side of this glass and he looked me in the eye.
Can you do the same?
I'm doing my best.
Well, it's not good enough.
What am I supposed to do?
You really are a little shit.
You know that?
I never thought I'd have to say that.
Big men make big moves, Vincent.
Are you a big man?
Hey.
I knew Biggs had to be hot on my trail.
You don't take $2 million from a guy like that and expect him to forget about it.
No no, you've got to explain it to me again.
The same guy that shot you whacked Petey, took my money, and you want me to believe that?
Yes.
I told you I was looking for him when you first grabbed me, remember?
You think I'd be sitting here if I had your money?
Shit, I ain't crazy.
What?
- Where's my money?
- Vincent has your money.
Your friend Vincent?
Yes.
I know where Vincent is and I know where the money is.
There's just one problem.
He's got an army around him.
An army of juvenile delinquents with pistols?
Give me some of your men and we'll go get the money and bring it right back.
I have a different plan.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm cool.
You sure?
All right.
You want a drink?
No thank you.
Might help you relax a little.
Why is it rich people are always telling me to relax?
'Cause you're young.
You're a young man.
Young guys just want to run through their life as fast as they can.
Set it up, knock it down.
Set it up, knock it down.
It's short, real short.
You get to be my age you see just how short it is.
The older you get, the closer you get to your death, you want to relax.
You want to take your time.
There's no rush, kid.
You sure you don't want that drink?
Yeah, I'll take a drink.
- Bourbon or Scotch?
- Bourbon.
Crap.
You should know I hate this John R prick.
Just let me do the talking when we get there, all right?
Hey, you go to church?
I used to.
It got to a point they didn't want to see me there anymore.
I still help them out with donations.
I could see those priests up there sweating.
I made them nervous.
So you believe in God?
I don't know if I believe in their God.
Yeah, I pray.
I pray every night.
I need a God that's got a lot of forgiveness.
You're gonna be all right though.
Don't worry about a thing.
What's the matter, Vince?
You look like you've seen a fucking ghost.
- You know why we're here, John?
- Yeah, I know.
That's the kid you wanted to see.
Consider him delivered.
Where's my money?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Give him his fucking money, Vince.
I don't know what this dude told you, but it's bullshit.
Last chance.
With all due respect, I know exactly who you are and I would never fucking steal--
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.
Everybody just take it easy.
God damn it.
That's for Petey.
You got something of this man's, you give it to him now.
Or we could all die, John.
Shit.
Oh!
Hey!
- Move!
Watch out.
Fuck!
Saunders, don't you fucking move my dad.
I've got your money and I'll be there in an hour.
Going somewhere?
Who the fuck are you?
That's not the topic.
All right, what is the topic?
Diamonds.
Mm-hmm.
That's right.
Sit down.
Sit down!
You know, in some countries they cut off the hand that steals.
And you stole from us.
So the way I see it, you have three choices:
you can fuck around, in which case I kill you;
you can go for that gun on the desk and I kill you;
or you can just give me the diamonds and I'll let you disappear.
Yeah right.
Look, my friend, you're not half as tough as your little girlfriend.
And at the end she talked.
So what is it going to be?
She wasn't my girlfriend.
She was my family.
You got off easy, motherfucker.
isn't much fun dying, huh, Vince?
Start digging.
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
You want me to dig my own goddamn grave?
Don't make me say it again.
I said start digging.
And make sure it's deep so you're comfortable.
How much do you want?
Huh?
How much is my life worth to you?
A rat's skin is only worth something to a rat, Vince.
Man, bullshit.
Come on.
Who are you to judge me?
You ever thought about where the fuck you'd be without me?
Yeah, I thought about that when I thought I was taking my last breath.
Man, who was the one out there making contacts, setting up scores while you and Dave was getting high?
Huh?
Me.
Who was the one who brought you in on shit, put money in your pockets, helped you support your moms?
- Me!
- That's what I don't understand, man.
That's what--
We were family, man.
We were brothers.
- You, me and Dave--
- Fuck Dave, dude.
Come on.
That stuttering little bitch.
This is about us, man.
How long before him and his big-ass mouth would have got us all whacked?
He was loyal.
He was weak.
He was my friend.
Just like you, Vince.
Remember?
Oh fuck.
Let me tell you something as your friend, Sonny.
Everything you got in this world is because of me.
Everything you fucking are in this world is because of me.
What could you have gotten into that was so bad that you couldn't tell me?
Huh?
Tell me, I want to know.
I had your back since we were kids, man.
And what do you do?
You fucking shoot me and leave me for dead.
I had no choice, man.
I was in over my head.
I couldn't-- I needed all the money.
They were gonna-- they were gonna kill my father.
- What?
- They were gonna kill my dad.
Sonny, you're right, man.
And I'm sorry.
I should have come to you.
But you-- you've gotta tell me, what can I do right now?
How can I make this right, man?
Tell me what to do.
You should have thought about that before.
You make peace with God, not me.
Do it.
Fucking do it, Sonny.
Shoot my ass.
'Cause you know what?
You ain't nothing in this world without me, man.
You shoot me and we're the same.
We'll both be gone.
We're not the same.
You're fucking pathetic, man.
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, man!
I don't need you, Sonny.
I don't need you, man.
You need me.
You need me!
I'm gonna walk out of here.
You'll see, man.
You hear me?
You hear me?
!
Fuck you!
I'll find your ass!
Fuck you, Sonny!
Yo, man, check it out.
Check it out.
Yo, it was nice knowing you, buddy.
Break it up!
Make a hole!
- Get back!
Get back!
- Back off!
- Back off!
-I need a medic in Red.
- Back up.
- Get back.
Get back on the wall.
Get back.
Let me see your hand.
Get your hand out of there.
- How are you doing?

"At Eidsvold, in 1814, the foundation for the privileges we now take for granted in modern Norway was laid.
Our capabilities, our rights, our nation's independence Norway's honor, and our individuality was carved out of bold, forward-looking men.
If these gentlemen had traveled in time, to be here today, and looked out at this great assembly, they would have seen the waving flags, kids excited faces, they'd be overwhelmed and bursting... with parental pride."
Holy shit!
I'll count to three, here they come.
- Do you want all the bananas we have?
- Of course, it's July
Hi, here are the neighbors!
Hello, Svendsen!
Happy Holidays!
- Merry Christmas.
- Is it lamb ribs or cod this year?
- We having ribs, a pig-feast!
Wow, you look hungry, girls.
Do you want a banana?
- Do you want one?
- No thanks,
Merry Christmas, then!
White Christmas!
- What's that?
It's bananas.
- From Ecuador,
- Ecuador?
Is it a republic?
This year we will have no Jesus nonsense like last year,
This year we celebrate with bananas!
What a charming tree!
Hi, Ivan!
Hi, boys.
Hello, my boy.
- How is it in London?
- It's raining.
- Are you here for a few days?
- I'm going to Mom's for the first day.
Then you get Christmas Eve with us.
- Try to look like a normal family.
- OK.
Like this?
Did you take all of them?
- No!
What are you doing?
- What is it?
The bananas should not be in the oven!
Set it up again!
You've ruined the bird, you maniac!
Everything is going to taste of banana!
Go away, do something else,
Good to see you, Come on!
So the family are living the happy suburban dream?
- As a father himself has drawn.
- More cost-effective housing.
- Everyone can afford a home in Rykkinn.
- Not everyone can afford a house.
Everything is great here.
Lots of kids here, they enjoy school.
Remember that teachers unconsciously argue for capitalism
I'll show you something, John.
The Evensen blocks were the first to be built.
This is not cheap,
They think they are kings,
Down with the patriarchy!
You will not escape: the Ba-:rum is a dark blue Conservative bastion.
- Rykkinn is different,
- You've started a red local association?
Let's be independent of the adults!
We are fighting for independence!
Down with the patriarchy!
Down with the patriarchy!
- Great!
- Down with the patriarchy!
Now, remember what Nietzsche said, about the Christian God:
"In him are all harmful, denying",
"all the hostility against life brought to a creepy union."
Christ says that people are small, sinful, that we must be saved from ourselves.
But, dear guests, we are apes.
We are apes.
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
The monkeys were in fact divine, Therefore it is that we eat bananas.
So on this day when Christ gave us salvation, -
We can be ourselves, enjoy life, be apes and eat food.
Enjoing life, monkey?
- Yes, in the jungle.
- A bunch of bananas!
- Merry Christmas!
- Yellow Christmas!
Are there more bananas?
If someone sends the bowls back we will refill them.
"So comrades, come rally,"
"And the last fight let us face"
"The Internationale"
"unites the human race."
"So comrades, come rally..."
Nicholas?
Where are you?
Give a little beep.
Hey, guys!
- Do you want to see a great fuck?
- Nicholas?
Close the door,
- Now let the boys see, then.
- Magnus, they are too small.
Is that our house?
This is our house, my young master.
"Young man"?
- What are you?
The old gentleman?
- No.
I'm not a gentleman.
It is you, so.
- Am I the master?
- I am the servant, me.
I can call you "my young gentleman".
- When can I call you "old" servant,
- And what about the master?
A cola.
Cola?
Capitalism's black blood?
I got a thousand dollars for my birthday.
Oh, Bloody hell!
Adults are easily fooled, that is.
- Why do you bother to trick them, 'a?
- Because they deserve it.
Howdy, girls.
Get to know your hair, 'a
Want to join us in the shelter?
- Can I feel your tits a little?
- Sorry, we are not gay.
Come back, cowards!
I'm not finished with you!
Look.
- Do you want it?
- Yes.
Looking forward to hearing it'?
Lust for life!
Lust for life!
Dad!
Ah!
Come on!
Ah!
No.
Drink this.
Close your eyes,
I think I gotta go now,
See you tomorrow,
- Anton is a real punk,
- What's the difference?
- In what?
- Between a real and a fake.
A real punk is someone who doesn't give a damn.
Gives a damn what?
- In everything, brother.
- In everything?
Clearly, In schools, parents, -
- Teachers and society,
There it is.
Hi, boys.
Hi, Anton's at home?
Just go down and knock,
Sit down
- Do you know who the Pistols are?
- Play it.
No, you are only little kids.
It's about the English queen.
She's not human.
What is she?
A historic monster, A fucking fascist,
- Yeah, so what?
- She has killed the future.
Fortunately.
It's over.
Everything is over.
No future for you!
No future!
No future!
Although we sometimes do dark things, -
It doesn't mean we are bad people.
Yes, hello?
There is nothing they can do,
Mum...
Dear, dear guests.
Merry Christmas!
I would just like to say a few words about being a family.
For a Copenhagen girl like me and a Norwegian maniac, to live together and live happily together,
We need, especially at Christmas, a unique ability to compromise.
I get to eat my favorite childhood dish: turkey.
And Magnus is allowed to cultivate his latest passion: bananas,
What nonsense.
It is you who are my great passion.
Now it's time for me to tum off the ventilator.
So you can say goodbye, everyone,
And then... she will stop breathing in a matter of minutes.
She will not feel any pain.
Doesn't Kevin Keegan play for Liverpool?
- Not any more.
- Who does he play for now, then?
For a team called Hamburger Sport-Verein.
Isn't that in Germany?
Yes.
I have made some porridge for you.
Just put it there.
May I have a little drink?
Dad?
Magnus!
Dad!
You dropped your boot.
What should I do?
I can't even keep hold of my boots, Nikola].
- Here it is.
- Thank you,
Now it's just the two of us, Now we have to ready ourselves,
- What do you mean?
- The two of us.
- What about Peter?
- No.
No, now it's just two of us.
In the same boat,
Same boat...
We're going to do it.
I do not understand it.
His temperature is 34 degrees.
And you feel... cold?
Yes, you can call me if he does not warm up in a couple of days,
- I'm going in.
- Bye.
- Hi.
- Hello,
My mother was hit down the road there.
- Yes, it was not long ago.
- Was she okay?
No.
Was she injured?
Yes, she is dead.
Ten days ago?
Yes.
I must go
I found a strand of her hair today.
In the bed when I woke up this morning.
It's as if she's here somewhere.
I can feel her.
- That's absolutely terrible.
- A hole in the ice fields -
Probably in a stolen car.
- Hi, Aunt Vera!
- Hi, Peter.
There is so much crime among the young.
They steal cars, use drugs, drive without a license,
I don't know what they are thinking!
Magnus and I have talked,
We wondered whether Peter would stay with us for a while.
Just a little while, until all this is over.
- Should I come and stay with you?
- Only if you want to.
Your father has a chance to recover.
Uncle Theo can drive you to school.
Would you do it?
I don't know, maybe,
- Is that okay with you?
- Maybe it's best.
-"Whore".
-"Prostitute"
"Women who sell sexual services as a profession" "mainly to men."
- I love the old words,
"A person whose sinful life leads to universal condemnation."
Then I'll be a prostitute When I grow up!
- What is he doing?
- Drawing.
- Is that a new house?
- Yes, it's a glass house.
One can see in anywhere,
Such a house was never built before, guys, this is the first,
- Are you going out?
- Yes.
Dinner at five o'clock.
Mutton stew.
- My favourite meal.
- Then you eat here, Tor.
- I listened to this record.
- Which record?
Where did you get that from?
What does he sing about, Johnny Rotten?
Different things.
- He doesn't like much.
- He's an anarchist.
I think it seems like he is against everything,
He doesn't like the queen, fair enough.
But not the fans either.
And not communists, politicians, the unemployed, hobby painters,
Hippies, jazz musicians,
So what does he really stand for?
- Why would he destroy everything?
- Everything rotten should be tom down.
- What is it that is so rotten, then?
- Almost everything.
Abba, Nitimen, the evening news, school, teachers, gym teachers and Thorbjom Egner,
- But what's wrong with Thorbjom Egner?
- The Cardamom Act.
- What's wrong with it?
- It's a big, fat lie.
"You must not harass, but be nice and kind", "Otherwise you can do what you want,"
- Isn't that a form of anarchism?
- For the rest, perhaps,
The country is full of nice fantasies, Magnus.
The world is not good!
Oh no?
- You are quite famous, right?
- Well, I guess so.
I'm not trying to impress others.
I don't know that yet.
We will be called "Dirt" We will not play well.
We will play like shit!
Shut up!
Punk is not supposed to sound good.
We will not play well.
We will play so loud that poor people will believe that Satan flies out of their ares!
- Why don't we just call it "Shit"?
- It's a crap name,
"Dirt", then?
What is it?
Do you know what punk is all about?
The word comes from Shakespeare's "Merry Wives of Windsor",
There is a person called Gun that uses the word "punk".
Shakespeare?
So, there is not a 100 people who know what punk means.
Those who have a clue, know that it means "junk" or "rabble."
You will have new names, too.
Tor Idiot.
Dastardly Niko.
And Viggo Ussel.
- And you, Anton?
- I shall be called...
- Anton's Death.
- What?
- Anton's Death.
- Can that be a name?
It's the best name
OK, play it through once.
One, two, three.,.
Yes?
Hello, Nancy.
Where will you end up, then, Gunnar, if you never try anything new?
If you only reproduce the anti-human, your lines will be unimaginative?
So you think that the whole Norwegian society should be like you and never deviate from your norm?
Do you understand how monstrous that is?
Yes, but think of money for a fucking second!
We must sell the car.
Why are you doing this?
We've got to sell it.
Dad has stopped work.
We need money.
And they would feel overwhelmed and bursting...
Oh my God!
Take the door!
I don't need to explain how angry we all are.
Teachers.
Parents, 17-May-committee.
Parents' Committee,
What happened on the National Day is something that everyone wants to forget very soon, but...
Before we do, we need to identify and clean out the bad attitudes which led to this behavior.
Shame on you!
Do you hear me, punks?
!
Shame on you!
What happened here on Independence Day, is unacceptable!
It is the lowest and crudest form of communication.
Throw a bottle at a man holding a speech?
No.
I have no words.
Anyone who does so should prepare for the most serious consequences!
- And this also applies to our fathers?
- Excuse me?
Feel free to denigrate these children's rebellious attitudes,
"They went too far," etc.
Honestly.
This here is a cloth case.
What clearly must be the most important theme here today is the serious assault which they were forced to by the mob of fathers who knocked them senseless, punched and kicked them!
See what they have done to him!
It came to my attention that the school caretakers also participated in the mob,
If you can verify that, the principal should know that he'll be punished.
The relationship will naturally be prosecuted as soon as possible.
The head teacher should consider himself lucky, if after this he can work at any school!
And all this violence, destructive behavior, because of a tiny scratch on the forehead of a grown man?
What?
!
A beer bottle on the head is a small price to pay for the healthy, rebellious attitude of these children.
I say hurray!
You should too.
That should be your mission, to teach students to rebel!
If a generation does not protest, the world will stagnate!
But this probably will not happen.
Let's get away from this man.
First, I just heard that infernal noise.
But it is a wonderful musical expression.
Such energy!
It reminds me of the Dadaist rebellion against the Bourgeois in 1919,
Tristan Tzar and the wild bunch.
They wanted to break everything down.
Anarchists like Johnny Ratten.
- Rotten.
Actually his name is Lydon.
- What?
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, come on.
What do you think?
Now it's summer vacation.
It's been registered for two.
- Where will the second seat be, then?
- Here.
Get your toolbox,
This year, Nikola], this year you and I will have the world's best summer!
Doesn't it go, Niko?
"You old woman, you are overactive, you rock the High North..."
- Ai, ai!
- Oh, old friend!
- Good to see you.
- Likewise.
Yes, you get to see Nikolai, the middle one.
Arne Dahlgren.
I am familiar with this wild one from school.
You should have seen how the girls lay down for him.
Yes, get undressed over there, I'll show you around.
- Shit!
- Don't be so cowardly now, Nicholas.
Don't you want to join in and see the cabinet Dahlgren has built?
Dahlgren has built a cabinet to..
- Yes, it's completely innocent,
- Oh, yes,
Nicholas, I'll go and talk to them for a bit.
We have things inside us, Nikola].
There are forces there.
We live in a world hostile to the body, Nikola].
Nudity and sexuality are shameful,
I am experimenting to free the body.
I have made my own version of Wilhelm Reich's Orgone cabinet.
Twenty minutes in the cabinet will make you relax.
Just sit still, Nikolai.
Then you will feel a slight vibration in the body.
It is your life energy awakening,
All the energy that radiates from your body, all by itself.
It will be gathered up and thrown back!
Then you will feel that it ?
ows more healthily..
Hello!
Let me out!
Why are you wearing pants?
Why are you naked?
We are at a nudist camp.
Hippies think they are so damn honest.
What about punks?
Don't you think you are honest?
Do you think I'm cute?
Is that so difficult to answer?
I don't know.
You who are so honest, should be able to answer it,
It is not easy to be honest when you do not know what you mean.
Who the hell are you?
Only a small boy in swimming trunks.
Nicholas!
Come on!
You must wake up.
We're going swimming.
It's delicious!
Come on, Nicholas!
Hello!
It's the police, Nikolai!
Yes, good afternoon.
The police are out in the nice weather?
Yes, do you have a vehicle registration certificate?
It should be in order.
Did you build this yourself?
Yes, I did.
I spent a number of hours in the garage at home making it.
This keeps it stable when we are driving,
Listen here.
If you go home and put your pants on you can go for a drive.
Push on!
Push on!
Hold on!
Oddvar Nordli rules the country!
Oddvar Nordli flies on the water!
No punk like him, Oddvar Nordli's our man!
Oddvar Nordli!
Oddvar Nordli!
What the hell?
If there's a gig, you must stop being so fucking far away, Niko.
Do you have anything on you, Viggo?
Relax.
It's slimming powder,
Us punks have to stay thin and awake,
Come on, we drive on!
It has taken me a long time to figure this out.
- The hidden plan.
- What secret plan?
See here.
See how Rykkinn is built?
As a funnel from which all movement points towards the Kl Centre.
This place was not built to house people,
- Or to found a safe community.
- Why was it built, then?
To suck the dollars and cents out of residents here at the Al center.
This is suburbia's hidden meaning, Rykkinn's real heart,
All this was built to create consumers of the municipality,
- And then?
..so?
..
Don't you realize that it was swindle?
Ba-:rum is a cannibal!
You will be eaten!
Every day you will be eaten alive!
Don't you know?
You will be eaten!
Eaten!
Hush, hush.
Is everything okay with you?
Yes, it worries me a little he is so seldom at school,
Yes, he is good in many subjects, but when he is so absent,..
He has not been in a bad crowd?
You know, down at the Kl Centre?
No, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.
I had written to the principal long ago.
I've decided to take Nikolai out of school for a while,
Teach him at home.
Yes, he is studying music now.
He sat and practiced late into the night yesterday.
The music is the basis for teaching program, which includes architecture, literature, philosophy.
Dear pig, show that you are smart!
Gogen, Goggen, Goggen, Goggen!
Gogen", Goggen, Goggen!
I talked with him at the Golden Arrow.
He heard the tape we sent, and,..
We got a gig at the Arrow!
You were good, guys!
Bravo!
Hey.
Do you have any speed?
I have 250
- Now you can go.
- Good luck.
Viggo?
- Viggo!
- Damn, what's this!
- What's wrong with him?
- Just the flu.
It's something that goes.
Damn, Viggo!
This is the last song!
Now you can go.
- I can play well, if that.,.
- You little punk!
Being punk isn't about how old you are, it's all about..
Yeah, what?
- To dare to be shit.
- But he can not even play!
- I have played.
In music school.
It will be alright.
Revered by the punks.
Loved by the pig!
Show that you are smart!
Goggen, Goggen, Goggen, Goggen!
Holy shit!
Damn!
Hell!
Punks are not fucking assholes!
Where the hell was your father?
Magnus!
Magnus?
- Has anyone told you that, Niko?
- What?
- You have cat eyes.
- What are you talking about?
People think cats are lazy animals, lazy zombies to be petted.
But the cat is a killing machine.
After being an indoor cat for eight years, its nature awakens.
Straight out to torture and murder, Nature is not sweet...
- What are you talking about?
- Is that something you would say?
I quit the band, Yes, you heard me!
We have never been so shit as we were today!
We were musical.
Cowardly little Niko, eh?
Had my father been on stage, I'd fucking die of shame!
What the hell are you doing?
!
I quit the band,
We have received a letter from the police.
"The case about your wife's death has been dropped."
Do you want cake?
I went out and bought it as soon as I got this letter.
It may seem a bit strange, but I thought, "This is a turning point,"
Now, life can go on.
We must lift our heads again now.
Lone would have wanted it.
There is plenty of life left for us to celebrate,
See here.
With strawberry cream, just like your mom liked.
Will you tell me something?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
Can't you confide in me a little?
Help me a little, Nikolai.
I can not reach you.
It takes two to confide.
Mom would have liked this.
You need to eat more.
Eat a little more of Mom.
Take a real bite out of Mom.
Address?
Does your father know you're out so late?
Answer me, damn it!
Head injuries are very serious.
There is nothing more we can do.
You can do something, right?
I understand that this is not easy to understand.
There is nothing we can do.
- Nothing?
- We just have to wait and see,
Look at it.
Look at all of it.
It's fucking bollocks, but I love it!
It's hilarious.
This is the world, and it is made of tiny little pieces of excrement.
Excrement?
Crap
Chaos is crap.
Personality is crap, everything is crap, but once you understand it, you'll find in life that anything is possible.
Ah yes, freedom is shit.
Shit is freedom.
Once you understand this, anything is possible.
You must all put on your hats, boys,
Peter, please wait.
Look here.
We need to bring everything.
Come on, boys.
Happy Holidays!
Happy Holidays!
- Merry Christmas, my boy,
- Watch your neck, now!
Holy shit, I'm so glad to see all my boys again!
Gingerbread?
Gingerbread for all, hm?
Come then, Tor, Tor has a gift,
Just a little thing.
Thank you, brother.
Do you know that Anton is dead?
Your friend?
- Anton?
- Yes.
They found him at home two weeks ago.
He drowned in his own vomit, Niko.
Forgive me, boys.
I have not been myself.
I've been so confused, I have...
I have been completely lost in all this,
So fucking confused.
Peter, we soaked Tor!
Now we go, boys.
So long, my boy!
Bye
"At Eidsvold, in 1814, the foundation for the privileges we now take for granted in modern Norway was laid.
Our capabilities, our rights, our nation's independence Norway's honor, and our individuality was carved out of bold, forward-looking men.

- What do you mean?
- The two of us.
- What about Peter?
- No.
No, now it's just two of us.
In the same boat,
Same boat...
We're going to do it.
I do not understand it.
His temperature is 34 degrees.
And you feel... cold?
Yes, you can call me if he does not warm up in a couple of days,
- I'm going in.
- Bye.
- Hi.
- Hello,
My mother was hit down the road there.
- Yes, it was not long ago.
- Was she okay?
No.
Was she injured?
Yes, she is dead.
Ten days ago?
Yes.
I must go
I found a strand of her hair today.
In the bed when I woke up this morning.
It's as if she's here somewhere.
I can feel her.
- That's absolutely terrible.
- A hole in the ice fields -
Probably in a stolen car.
- Hi, Aunt Vera!
- Hi, Peter.
There is so much crime among the young.
They steal cars, use drugs, drive without a license,
I don't know what they are thinking!
Magnus and I have talked,
We wondered whether Peter would stay with us for a while.
Just a little while, until all this is over.
- Should I come and stay with you?
- Only if you want to.
Your father has a chance to recover.
Uncle Theo can drive you to school.
Would you do it?
I don't know, maybe,
- Is that okay with you?
- Maybe it's best.
-"Whore".
-"Prostitute"
"Women who sell sexual services as a profession" "mainly to men."
- I love the old words,
"A person whose sinful life leads to universal condemnation."
Then I'll be a prostitute When I grow up!
- What is he doing?
- Drawing.
- Is that a new house?
- Yes, it's a glass house.
One can see in anywhere,
Such a house was never built before, guys, this is the first,
- Are you going out?
- Yes.
Dinner at five o'clock.
Mutton stew.
- My favourite meal.
- Then you eat here, Tor.
- I listened to this record.
- Which record?
Where did you get that from?
What does he sing about, Johnny Rotten?
Different things.
- He doesn't like much.
- He's an anarchist.
I think it seems like he is against everything,
He doesn't like the queen, fair enough.
But not the fans either.
And not communists, politicians, the unemployed, hobby painters,
Hippies, jazz musicians,
So what does he really stand for?
- Why would he destroy everything?
- Everything rotten should be tom down.
- What is it that is so rotten, then?
- Almost everything.
Abba, Nitimen, the evening news, school, teachers, gym teachers and Thorbjom Egner,
- But what's wrong with Thorbjom Egner?
- The Cardamom Act.
- What's wrong with it?
- It's a big, fat lie.
"You must not harass, but be nice and kind", "Otherwise you can do what you want,"
- Isn't that a form of anarchism?
- For the rest, perhaps,
The country is full of nice fantasies, Magnus.
The world is not good!
Oh no?
- You are quite famous, right?
- Well, I guess so.
I'm not trying to impress others.
I don't know that yet.
We will be called "Dirt" We will not play well.
We will play like shit!
Shut up!
Punk is not supposed to sound good.
We will not play well.
We will play so loud that poor people will believe that Satan flies out of their ares!
- Why don't we just call it "Shit"?
- It's a crap name,
"Dirt", then?
What is it?
Do you know what punk is all about?
The word comes from Shakespeare's "Merry Wives of Windsor",
There is a person called Gun that uses the word "punk".
Shakespeare?
So, there is not a 100 people who know what punk means.
Those who have a clue, know that it means "junk" or "rabble."
You will have new names, too.
Tor Idiot.
Dastardly Niko.
And Viggo Ussel.
- And you, Anton?
- I shall be called...
- Anton's Death.
- What?
- Anton's Death.
- Can that be a name?
It's the best name
OK, play it through once.
One, two, three.,.
Yes?
Hello, Nancy.
Where will you end up, then, Gunnar, if you never try anything new?
If you only reproduce the anti-human, your lines will be unimaginative?
So you think that the whole Norwegian society should be like you and never deviate from your norm?
Do you understand how monstrous that is?
Yes, but think of money for a fucking second!
We must sell the car.
Why are you doing this?
We've got to sell it.
Dad has stopped work.
We need money.
And they would feel overwhelmed and bursting...
Oh my God!
Take the door!
I don't need to explain how angry we all are.
Teachers.
Parents, 17-May-committee.
Parents' Committee,
What happened on the National Day is something that everyone wants to forget very soon, but...
Before we do, we need to identify and clean out the bad attitudes which led to this behavior.
Shame on you!
Do you hear me, punks?
!
Shame on you!
What happened here on Independence Day, is unacceptable!
It is the lowest and crudest form of communication.
Throw a bottle at a man holding a speech?
No.
I have no words.
Anyone who does so should prepare for the most serious consequences!
- And this also applies to our fathers?
- Excuse me?
Feel free to denigrate these children's rebellious attitudes,
"They went too far," etc.
Honestly.
This here is a cloth case.
What clearly must be the most important theme here today is the serious assault which they were forced to by the mob of fathers who knocked them senseless, punched and kicked them!
See what they have done to him!
It came to my attention that the school caretakers also participated in the mob,
If you can verify that, the principal should know that he'll be punished.
The relationship will naturally be prosecuted as soon as possible.
The head teacher should consider himself lucky, if after this he can work at any school!
And all this violence, destructive behavior, because of a tiny scratch on the forehead of a grown man?
What?
!
A beer bottle on the head is a small price to pay for the healthy, rebellious attitude of these children.
I say hurray!
You should too.
That should be your mission, to teach students to rebel!
If a generation does not protest, the world will stagnate!
But this probably will not happen.
Let's get away from this man.
First, I just heard that infernal noise.
But it is a wonderful musical expression.
Such energy!
It reminds me of the Dadaist rebellion against the Bourgeois in 1919,
Tristan Tzar and the wild bunch.
They wanted to break everything down.
Anarchists like Johnny Ratten.
- Rotten.
Actually his name is Lydon.
- What?
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, come on.
What do you think?
Now it's summer vacation.
It's been registered for two.
- Where will the second seat be, then?
- Here.
Get your toolbox,
This year, Nikola], this year you and I will have the world's best summer!
Doesn't it go, Niko?
"You old woman, you are overactive, you rock the High North..."
- Ai, ai!
- Oh, old friend!
- Good to see you.
- Likewise.
Yes, you get to see Nikolai, the middle one.
Arne Dahlgren.
I am familiar with this wild one from school.
You should have seen how the girls lay down for him.
Yes, get undressed over there, I'll show you around.
- Shit!
- Don't be so cowardly now, Nicholas.
Don't you want to join in and see the cabinet Dahlgren has built?
Dahlgren has built a cabinet to..
- Yes, it's completely innocent,
- Oh, yes,
Nicholas, I'll go and talk to them for a bit.
We have things inside us, Nikola].
There are forces there.
We live in a world hostile to the body, Nikola].
Nudity and sexuality are shameful,
I am experimenting to free the body.
I have made my own version of Wilhelm Reich's Orgone cabinet.
Twenty minutes in the cabinet will make you relax.
Just sit still, Nikolai.
Then you will feel a slight vibration in the body.
It is your life energy awakening,
All the energy that radiates from your body, all by itself.
It will be gathered up and thrown back!
Then you will feel that it ?
ows more healthily..
Hello!
Let me out!
Why are you wearing pants?
Why are you naked?
We are at a nudist camp.
Hippies think they are so damn honest.
What about punks?
Don't you think you are honest?
Do you think I'm cute?
Is that so difficult to answer?
I don't know.
You who are so honest, should be able to answer it,
It is not easy to be honest when you do not know what you mean.
Who the hell are you?
Only a small boy in swimming trunks.
Nicholas!
Come on!
You must wake up.
We're going swimming.
It's delicious!
Come on, Nicholas!
Hello!
It's the police, Nikolai!
Yes, good afternoon.
The police are out in the nice weather?
Yes, do you have a vehicle registration certificate?
It should be in order.
Did you build this yourself?
Yes, I did.
I spent a number of hours in the garage at home making it.
This keeps it stable when we are driving,
Listen here.
If you go home and put your pants on you can go for a drive.
Push on!
Push on!
Hold on!
Oddvar Nordli rules the country!
Oddvar Nordli flies on the water!
No punk like him, Oddvar Nordli's our man!
Oddvar Nordli!
Oddvar Nordli!
What the hell?
If there's a gig, you must stop being so fucking far away, Niko.
Do you have anything on you, Viggo?
Relax.
It's slimming powder,
Us punks have to stay thin and awake,
Come on, we drive on!
It has taken me a long time to figure this out.
- The hidden plan.
- What secret plan?
See here.
See how Rykkinn is built?
As a funnel from which all movement points towards the Kl Centre.
This place was not built to house people,
- Or to found a safe community.
- Why was it built, then?
To suck the dollars and cents out of residents here at the Al center.
This is suburbia's hidden meaning, Rykkinn's real heart,
All this was built to create consumers of the municipality,
- And then?
..so?
..
Don't you realize that it was swindle?
Ba-:rum is a cannibal!
You will be eaten!
Every day you will be eaten alive!
Don't you know?
You will be eaten!
Eaten!
Hush, hush.
Is everything okay with you?
Yes, it worries me a little he is so seldom at school,
Yes, he is good in many subjects, but when he is so absent,..
He has not been in a bad crowd?
You know, down at the Kl Centre?
No, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.
I had written to the principal long ago.
I've decided to take Nikolai out of school for a while,
Teach him at home.
Yes, he is studying music now.
He sat and practiced late into the night yesterday.
The music is the basis for teaching program, which includes architecture, literature, philosophy.
Dear pig, show that you are smart!
Gogen, Goggen, Goggen, Goggen!
Gogen", Goggen, Goggen!
I talked with him at the Golden Arrow.
He heard the tape we sent, and,..
We got a gig at the Arrow!
You were good, guys!
Bravo!
Hey.
Do you have any speed?
I have 250
- Now you can go.
- Good luck.
Viggo?
- Viggo!
- Damn, what's this!
- What's wrong with him?
- Just the flu.
It's something that goes.
Damn, Viggo!
This is the last song!
Now you can go.
- I can play well, if that.,.
- You little punk!
Being punk isn't about how old you are, it's all about..
Yeah, what?
- To dare to be shit.
- But he can not even play!
- I have played.
In music school.
It will be alright.
Revered by the punks.
Loved by the pig!
Show that you are smart!
Goggen, Goggen, Goggen, Goggen!
Holy shit!
Damn!
Hell!
Punks are not fucking assholes!
Where the hell was your father?
Magnus!
Magnus?
- Has anyone told you that, Niko?
- What?
- You have cat eyes.
- What are you talking about?
People think cats are lazy animals, lazy zombies to be petted.
But the cat is a killing machine.
After being an indoor cat for eight years, its nature awakens.
Straight out to torture and murder, Nature is not sweet...
- What are you talking about?
- Is that something you would say?
I quit the band, Yes, you heard me!
We have never been so shit as we were today!
We were musical.
Cowardly little Niko, eh?
Had my father been on stage, I'd fucking die of shame!
What the hell are you doing?
!
I quit the band,
We have received a letter from the police.
"The case about your wife's death has been dropped."
Do you want cake?
I went out and bought it as soon as I got this letter.
It may seem a bit strange, but I thought, "This is a turning point,"
Now, life can go on.
We must lift our heads again now.
Lone would have wanted it.
There is plenty of life left for us to celebrate,
See here.
With strawberry cream, just like your mom liked.
Will you tell me something?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
Can't you confide in me a little?
Help me a little, Nikolai.
I can not reach you.
It takes two to confide.
Mom would have liked this.
You need to eat more.
Eat a little more of Mom.
Take a real bite out of Mom.
Address?
Does your father know you're out so late?
Answer me, damn it!
Head injuries are very serious.
There is nothing more we can do.
You can do something, right?
I understand that this is not easy to understand.
There is nothing we can do.
- Nothing?
- We just have to wait and see,
Look at it.
Look at all of it.
It's fucking bollocks, but I love it!
It's hilarious.
This is the world, and it is made of tiny little pieces of excrement.
Excrement?
Crap
Chaos is crap.
Personality is crap, everything is crap, but once you understand it, you'll find in life that anything is possible.
Ah yes, freedom is shit.
Shit is freedom.
Once you understand this, anything is possible.
You must all put on your hats, boys,
Peter, please wait.
Look here.
We need to bring everything.
Come on, boys.
Happy Holidays!
Happy Holidays!
- Merry Christmas, my boy,
- Watch your neck, now!
Holy shit, I'm so glad to see all my boys again!
Gingerbread?
Gingerbread for all, hm?
Come then, Tor, Tor has a gift,
Just a little thing.
Thank you, brother.
Do you know that Anton is dead?
Your friend?
- Anton?
- Yes.
They found him at home two weeks ago.
He drowned in his own vomit, Niko.
Forgive me, boys.
I have not been myself.
I've been so confused, I have...
I have been completely lost in all this,
So fucking confused.
Peter, we soaked Tor!
Now we go, boys.
So long, my boy!
Bye,
Subtitles:
Sons of Norway
At Eidsvold, in 1814, -
- Was laid the foundation for the privileges we now take for granted -
- In modern Norway.
Our capabilities, our rights -
- Our nation's independence, Norway's honor -
- And our individuality was carved out of bold, forward-looking men.
If these gentlemen had travelled in time -
- To be here today, and looked out at this great assembly, -
- They would have seen the waving flags,
- Kids excited faces, -
They would have been overwhelmed and bursting...
- With parental pride
Holy shit!
I'll count to three, here they come.
-Do you want all the bananas we have?
-Of course, it's July
Hi, here are the neighbors!
Hello, Svendsen!
Happy Holidays!
-Merry Christmas.
-Is it lamb ribs or cod this year?
-We having ribs, a pig-feast!
Wow, you look hungry, girls.
Do you want a banana?
-Do you want one?
-No thanks,
Merry Christmas, then!
White Christmas!
-What's that?
It's bananas.
-From Ecuador,
-Ecuador?
Is it a republic?
This year we will have no Jesus nonsense like last year,
This year we celebrate with bananas!
What a charming tree!
Hi, Ivan!
Hi, boys.
Hello, my boy.
-How is it in London?
-It's raining.
-Are you here for a few days?
-I'm going to Mom's for the first day.
Then you get Christmas Eve with us.
-Try to look like a normal family.
-Ok.
Like this?
Did you take all of them?
-No!
What are you doing?
-What is it?
The bananas should not be in the oven!
Set it up again!
You've ruined the bird, you maniac!
Everything is going to taste of banana!
Go away, do something else,
Good to see you, Come on!
So the family are living the happy suburban dream?
-As a father himself has drawn.
-More cost-effective housing.
-Aile can afford a home in Rykkinn.
-Not everyone can afford a house.
Everything is great here.
Lots of kids here, they enjoy school.
Just remember that teachers unconsciously argue for capitalism
I'll show you something, John.
The Evensen blocks were the first to be built.
This is not cheap,
They think they are kings,
Down with the patriarchy!
You will not escape: the Bærum is a dark blue Conservative bastion.
-Rykkinn is different,
-You've started a red local association?
Let's be independent of the adults!
We are fighting for independence!
Down with the patriarchy!
Down with the patriarchy!
-Great!
-Down with the patriarchy!
Now, remember what Nietzsche said, about the Christian God:
" In him are all harmful, denying", " All the hostility against life brought to a horrible device."
Christ says that men are small, sinful, -
- And that we must be saved from ourselves.
But, dear guests, we are apes.
We are apes.
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
The monkeys were in fact divine, Therefore it is that we eat bananas.
So on this day when Christ gave us salvation, -
- We can be ourselves, enjoy life, be apes and eat food.
Enjoying life, monkey?
-Yes, in the jungle.
-A bunch of bananas!
-Merry Christmas!
-Yellow Christmas!
Are there more bananas?
If someone sends the bowls back we will refill them.
"So comrades, come rally,"
"And the last fight let us face"
"The Internationale"
"unites the human race."
"So comrades, come rally..."
Nicholas?
Where are you?
Give a little beep.
Hey, guys!
-Do you want to see a great fuck?
-Nicholas?
Close the door,
-Now let the boys see, then.
-Magnus, they are too small.
Is that our house?
This is our house, my young master.
"Young man"?
-What are you?
The old gentleman?
-No.
I'm not a gentleman.
It is you, so.
-Am I the master?
-I am the servant, me.
I can call you "my young gentleman".
-When can I call you "old" servant,
-And what about the master?
A cola.
Cola?
Capitalism's black blood?
I got a thousand dollars for my birthday.
Oh, Bloody hell!
Adults are easily fooled, that is.
-Why do you bother to trick them, 'a?
-Because they deserve it.
Howdy, girls.
Get to know your hair, 'a
Want to join us in the shelter?
-Can I feel your tits a little?
-Sorry, we are not gay.
Come back, cowards!
I'm not finished with you!
Look.
-Do you want it?
-Yes.
Looking forward to hearing it?
Lust for life!
Lust for life!
Dad!
Ah!
Come on!
Ah!
No.
Drink this.
Close your eyes,
I think I gotta go now,
See you tomorrow,
-Anton is a real punk,
-What's the difference?
-In what?
-Between a real and a fake.
A real punk is someone who doesn't give a damn.
Gives a damn what?
-In everything, brother.
-In everything?
Clearly, In schools, parents, -
-Teachers and society,
There it is.
Hi, boys.
Hi, Anton's at home?
Just go down and knock,
Sit down
-Do you know who the Pistols are, or what?
-Play it
No, you are only little kids.
It's about the English queen.
She's not human.
What is she?
A historic monster, A fucking fascist,
-Yeah, so what?
-She has killed the future.
Fortunately.
It's over.
Everything is over.
No future for you!
No future!
No future!
Although we sometimes do dark things, -
- It does not that we are bad people.
Yes, hello?
There is nothing they can do,
Mum...
Dear, dear guests.
Merry Christmas!
I would just like to say a few words about being a family.
For a Copenhagen girl like me and a Norwegian maniac -
- To live together and live happily together,
We need, especially at Christmas, a unique ability to compromise.
I get to eat my favorite childhood dish: turkey.
And Magnus is allowed to cultivate his latest passion: bananas,
What nonsense.
It is you who are my great passion.
Now it's time for me to turn off the ventilator.
So you can say goodbye, everyone,
And then she will stop breathing in a matter of minutes.
She will not feel any pain.
Doesn't Kevin Keegan play for Liverpool?
-Not any more.
-Who does he play for now, then?
For a team called Hamburger Sport-Verein.
Isn't that in Germany?
Yes.
I have made some porridge for you.
Just put it there.
May I have a little drink?
Dad?
Magnus!
Dad!
You dropped your boot.
What should I do?
I can't even keep hold of my boots, Nikolaj.
-Here it is.
-Thank you,
Now it's just the two of us, Now we have to ready ourselves,
-What do you mean?
-The two of us.

- For the healthy, rebellious attitude of these children.
I say hurray!
You should too.
That should be your mission, to teach students to rebel!
If a generation does not protest, the world will stagnate!
But this probably will not happen.
Let's get away from this man.
First, I just heard that infernal noise.
But it is a wonderful musical expression.
Such energy!
It reminds me of when the Dadaists rebelled against the bourgeois sensibility in 1919,
Tristan Tzar and the wild bunch.
They wanted to break everything down, tear it all down.
Anarchists like Johnny Ratten.
-Rotten.
Actually his name is Lydon.
-What?
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, come on.
What do you think?
Now it's summer vacation.
It's been registered for two.
-Where will the second seat be, then?
-Here.
Get your toolbox,
This year, Nikolaj, this year you and I will have the world's best summer!
Doesn't it go, Niko?
"You old woman, you are overactive, you rock the High North..."
-Ai, ai!
-Oh, old friend!
-Good to see you.
-Likewise.
Yes, you get to see Nikolai, the middle one.
Arne Dahlgren.
I am familiar with this wild one from school.
You should have seen how the girls lay down for him.
Yes, get undressed over there, I'll show you around.
-Shit!
-Don't be so cowardly now, Nicholas.
Don't you want to join in and see the cabinet Dahlgren has built?
Dahlgren has built a cabinet to ..
-Yes, it's completely innocent,
-Oh, yes,
Nicholas, I'll go and talk to them for a bit.
We have things inside us, Nikolaj.
There are forces there.
We live in a world hostile to the body, Nikolaj.
Nudity and sexuality are shameful,
I am experimenting to free the body.
I have made ​​my own version of Wilhelm Reich's Orgone cabinets.
Twenty minutes in the closet will allow you to loosen up, to flow more freely,
Just sit still, Nikolai.
Then you will feel a slight vibration in the body.
It is your life energy awakening,
All the energy that radiates from your body, all by itself.
It will be gathered up and thrown back!
Then you will feel that it flows more healthily ..
Hello!
Let me out!
Why are you wearing pants?
Why are you naked?
We are at a nudist camp.
Hippies think they are so damn honest.
What about punks?
Don't you think you are honest?
Do you think I'm cute?
Is that so difficult to answer?
I don't know.
You who are so honest, should be able to answer it,
It is not easy to be honest when you do not know what you mean.
Who the hell are you?
Only a small boy in swimming trunks.
You, Nicholas!
Come on!
You must wake up.
We're going swimming.
It is delicious!
Come on, Nicholas!
Hello!
It's the police, Nikolay!
Yes, good afternoon.
The police are out in the nice weather?
Yes, do you have a small vehicle registration certificate?
It should be in order.
Did you build this yourself?
Yes, I did.
I spent a number of hours in the garage at home making it.
This keeps it stable when we are driving,
Listen here.
If you go home and put your pants on you can go for a drive.
Push on!
Push on!
Hold on!
Oddvar Nordli rules the country!
Oddvar Nordli flies on the water!
No punk like him, Oddvar Nordli's our man!
Oddvar Nordli!
Oddvar Nordli!
What the hell?
If there's a gig, you must stop being so fucking far away, Niko.
Do you have anything on you, Viggo?
Relax.
It's slimming powder,
Us punks have to stay thin and awake,
Come on, we drive on!
It has taken me a long time to figure this out.
-The hidden plan.
-What secret plan?
See here.
See how Rykkinn is built?
As a funnel from which all movement points towards the CI Centre.
This place was not built to house people,
-Or to found a safe community.
-Why was it built, then?
In order to suck the dollars and cents out of residents here at the AI ​​center.
This is suburbia's hidden meaning, Rykkinn's real heart,
All this was built to create consumers of the municipality,
-And then?
-"So?"
Don't you realize that everything was a sham?
Bærum is a cannibal!
You will be eaten!
Every day you will be eaten alive!
Don't you know?
You will be eaten!
Eaten!
Hush, hush.
Is everything okay with you?
Yes, it worries me a little he is so seldom at school,
Yes, he is good in many subjects, but when he is so absent, ..
He has not been in a bad crowd?
You know, down at the AI center?
No, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.
I had written to the principal long ago.
I've decided to take Nikolai out of school for a while,
Teach him at home.
Yes, he is studying music now.
He sat and practiced late into the night yesterday.
The music is the basis for teaching program, which includes -
- Architecture, literature, philosophy.,.
Dear pig, show that you are smart!
Goggen, Goggen, Goggen, Goggen!
Goggen, Goggen, Goggen!
I talked with him at the Golden Arrow.
He heard the tape we sent, and, ..
We got a gig at the Arrow!
You were good, guys!
Bravo!
Hey.
Do you have any speed?
I have 250
-Now you can go.
-Good luck.
Viggo?
-Viggo!
-Damn, what's this!
-What's wrong with him?
-Just the flu.
It's something that goes.
Damn, Viggo!
This is the last song!
Now you can go.
-I can play well, if that.,.
-You little punk!
Being punk isn't about how old you are, it's all about ..
Yeah, what?
-To dare to be shit.
-But he can not even play!
-I have played.
In music school.
It will be alright.
Revered by the punks.
Loved by the pig!
Show that you are smart!
Goggen, Goggen, Goggen, Goggen!
Holy shit!
Damn!
Hell!
Punks are not fucking assholes!
Where the hell was your father?
Magnus!
Magnus?
-Has anyone told you that, Niko?
-What?
-You have cat eyes.
-What are you talking about?
People think cats are lazy animals, lazy zombies to be petted.
But the cat is a killing machine.
After being an indoor cat for eight years, its nature awakens.
Straight out to torture and murder, Nature is not sweet...
-What are you talking about?
-Is that something you would say?
I quit the band, Yes, you heard me!
We have never been so shit as we were today!
We were musical.
Cowardly little Niko, eh?
Had my father been on stage, I'd fucking die of shame!
What the hell are you doing?
!
I quit the band,
We have received a letter from the police.
"The case about your wife's death has been dropped."
Do you want cake?
I went out and bought it as soon as I got this letter.
It may seem a bit strange, but I thought, "This is a turning point,"
Now, life can go on.
We must lift our heads again now.
Lone would have wanted it.
There is plenty of life left for us to celebrate,
See here.
With strawberry cream, just like your mom liked.
Will you tell me something?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
Can't you confide in me a little?
Help me a little, Nikolai.
I can not reach you.
It takes two to confide.
Mom would have liked this.
You need to eat more.
Eat a little more of Mom.
Take a real bite out of Mom.
Address?
Does your father know that you are out so late?
Answer me, damn it!
Head injuries are very serious.
There is nothing more we can do.
You can do something, right?
I understand that this is not easy to understand.
There is nothing we can do.
-Nothing?
-We just have to wait and see,
Look at it.
Look at all of it.
It's fucking bollocks, but I love it!
It's hilarious.
This is the world, and it is made of tiny little pieces of excrement.
Excrement?
Crap
Chaos is crap.
Personality is crap, everything is crap, but once you understand it, -
- You'll find in life that anything is possible.
Ah yes, freedom is shit.
Shit is freedom.
Once you understand this, anything is possible.
You must all put on your hats, boys,
Peter, please wait.
Look here.
We need to bring everything.
Come on, boys.
Happy Holidays!
Happy Holidays!
-Merry Christmas, my boy,
-Watch your neck, now!
Holy shit, I'm so glad to see all my boys again!
Gingerbread?
Gingerbread for all, hm?
Come then, Tor, Tor has a gift,
Just a little thing.
Thank you, brother.
Do you know that Anton is dead?
Your friend?
-Anton?
-Yes.
They found him at home two weeks ago.
He drowned in his own vomit, Niko.
Forgive me, boys.
I have not been myself.
I've been so confused, I have ...
I have been completely lost in all this,
So fucking confused.
Peter, we soaked Tor!
Now we go, boys.
So long, my boy!
Bye,
Thank you for watching another XaW release!
At Eidsvold, in 1814, -
- Was laid the foundation for the privileges we now take for granted -
- In modern Norway.
Our capabilities, our rights -
- Our nation's independence, Norway's honor -
- And our individuality was carved out of bold, forward-looking men.
If these gentlemen had travelled in time -
- To be here today, and looked out at this great assembly, -
- They would have seen the waving flags,
- Kids excited faces, -
They would have been overwhelmed and bursting...
- With parental pride
Holy shit!
I'll count to three, here they come.
-Do you want all the bananas we have?
-Of course, it's July
Hi, here are the neighbors!
Hello, Svendsen!
Happy Holidays!
-Merry Christmas.
-Is it lamb ribs or cod this year?
-We having ribs, a pig-feast!
Wow, you look hungry, girls.
Do you want a banana?
-Do you want one?
-No thanks,
Merry Christmas, then!
White Christmas!
-What's that?
It's bananas.
-From Ecuador,
-Ecuador?
Is it a republic?
This year we will have no Jesus nonsense like last year,
This year we celebrate with bananas!
What a charming tree!
Hi, Ivan!
Hi, boys.
Hello, my boy.
-How is it in London?
-It's raining.
-Are you here for a few days?
-I'm going to Mom's for the first day.
Then you get Christmas Eve with us.
-Try to look like a normal family.
-Ok.
Like this?
Did you take all of them?
-No!
What are you doing?
-What is it?
The bananas should not be in the oven!
Set it up again!
You've ruined the bird, you maniac!
Everything is going to taste of banana!
Go away, do something else,
Good to see you, Come on!
So the family are living the happy suburban dream?
-As a father himself has drawn.
-More cost-effective housing.
-Aile can afford a home in Rykkinn.
-Not everyone can afford a house.
Everything is great here.
Lots of kids here, they enjoy school.
Just remember that teachers unconsciously argue for capitalism
I'll show you something, John.
The Evensen blocks were the first to be built.
This is not cheap,
They think they are kings,
Down with the patriarchy!
You will not escape: the Bærum is a dark blue Conservative bastion.
-Rykkinn is different,
-You've started a red local association?
Let's be independent of the adults!
We are fighting for independence!
Down with the patriarchy!
Down with the patriarchy!
-Great!
-Down with the patriarchy!
Now, remember what Nietzsche said, about the Christian God:
" In him are all harmful, denying", " All the hostility against life brought to a horrible device."
Christ says that men are small, sinful, -
- And that we must be saved from ourselves.
But, dear guests, we are apes.
We are apes.
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
The monkeys were in fact divine, Therefore it is that we eat bananas.
So on this day when Christ gave us salvation, -
- We can be ourselves, enjoy life, be apes and eat food.
Enjoying life, monkey?
-Yes, in the jungle.
-A bunch of bananas!
-Merry Christmas!
-Yellow Christmas!
Are there more bananas?
If someone sends the bowls back we will refill them.
"So comrades, come rally,"
"And the last fight let us face"
"The Internationale"
"unites the human race."
"So comrades, come rally..."
Nicholas?
Where are you?
Give a little beep.
Hey, guys!
-Do you want to see a great fuck?
-Nicholas?
Close the door,
-Now let the boys see, then.
-Magnus, they are too small.
Is that our house?
This is our house, my young master.
"Young man"?
-What are you?
The old gentleman?
-No.
I'm not a gentleman.
It is you, so.
-Am I the master?
-I am the servant, me.
I can call you "my young gentleman".
-When can I call you "old" servant,
-And what about the master?
A cola.
Cola?
Capitalism's black blood?
I got a thousand dollars for my birthday.
Oh, Bloody hell!
Adults are easily fooled, that is.
-Why do you bother to trick them, 'a?
-Because they deserve it.
Howdy, girls.
Get to know your hair, 'a
Want to join us in the shelter?
-Can I feel your tits a little?
-Sorry, we are not gay.
Come back, cowards!
I'm not finished with you!
Look.
-Do you want it?
-Yes.
Looking forward to hearing it?
Lust for life!
Lust for life!
Dad!
Ah!
Come on!
Ah!
No.
Drink this.
Close your eyes,
I think I gotta go now,
See you tomorrow,
-Anton is a real punk,
-What's the difference?
-In what?
-Between a real and a fake.
A real punk is someone who doesn't give a damn.
Gives a damn what?
-In everything, brother.
-In everything?
Clearly, In schools, parents, -
-Teachers and society,
There it is.
Hi, boys.
Hi, Anton's at home?
Just go down and knock,
Sit down
-Do you know who the Pistols are, or what?
-Play it
No, you are only little kids.
It's about the English queen.
She's not human.
What is she?
A historic monster, A fucking fascist,
-Yeah, so what?
-She has killed the future.
Fortunately.
It's over.
Everything is over.
No future for you!
No future!
No future!
Although we sometimes do dark things, -
- It does not that we are bad people.
Yes, hello?
There is nothing they can do,
Mum...
Dear, dear guests.
Merry Christmas!
I would just like to say a few words about being a family.
For a Copenhagen girl like me and a Norwegian maniac -
- To live together and live happily together,
We need, especially at Christmas, a unique ability to compromise.
I get to eat my favorite childhood dish: turkey.
And Magnus is allowed to cultivate his latest passion: bananas,
What nonsense.
It is you who are my great passion.
Now it's time for me to turn off the ventilator.
So you can say goodbye, everyone,
And then she will stop breathing in a matter of minutes.
She will not feel any pain.
Doesn't Kevin Keegan play for Liverpool?
-Not any more.
-Who does he play for now, then?
For a team called Hamburger Sport-Verein.
Isn't that in Germany?
Yes.
I have made some porridge for you.
Just put it there.
May I have a little drink?
Dad?
Magnus!
Dad!
You dropped your boot.
What should I do?
I can't even keep hold of my boots, Nikolaj.
-Here it is.
-Thank you,
Now it's just the two of us, Now we have to ready ourselves,
-What do you mean?
-The two of us.
-What about Peter?
-No.
No, now it's just two of us.
In the same boat,
Same boat...
We're going to do it.
I do not understand it.
His temperature is 34 degrees.
And you feel... cold?
Yes, you can call me if he does not warm up in a couple of days,
-I'm going in.
-Bye.
-Hi.
-Hello,
My mother was hit down the road there.
-Yes, it was not long ago.
-Was she okay?
No.
Was she injured?
Yes, she is dead.
Ten days ago?
Yes.
I must go
I found a strand of her hair today.
In the bed when I woke up this morning.
It's as if she's here somewhere.
I can feel her.
-That's absolutely terrible.
-A hole in the ice fields -
Probably in a stolen car.
-Hi, Aunt Vera!
-Hi, Peter.
There is so much crime among the young.
They steal cars, use drugs, drive without a license,
I don't know what they are thinking!
Magnus and I have talked,
We wondered whether Peter would stay with us for a while.
Just a little while, until all this is over.
-Should I come and stay with you?
-Only if you want to.
Your father can have a chance to recover.
Uncle Theo can drive you to school.
Would you do it?
I don't know, maybe,
-Is that okay with you?
-Maybe it's best.
-"Whore".
-"Prostitute"
"Women who sell sexual services as a profession" "mainly to men."
-I love the old words,
"A person whose sinful life leads to universal condemnation."
Then I'll be a prostitute When I grow up!
-What is he doing?
-Drawing.
-Is that a new house?
-Yes, it's a glass house.
One can see in anywhere,
Such a house has never been built before, guys, this is the first,
-Are you going out?
-Yes.
Dinner at five o'clock.
Mutton stew.
-My favourite meal.
-Then you eat here, Tor.
-I listened to this record.
-Which record?
Where did you get that from?
What does he sing about, Johnny Rotten?
Different things.
-He doesn't like much.
-He's an anarchist.
I think it seems like he is against everything,
He doesn't like the queen, fair enough.
But not the fans either.
And not communists, politicians, the unemployed, hobby painters, -
- Hippies, jazz musicians,
So what does he really stand for?
-Why would he destroy everything?
-Everything that is rotten, should be torn down.
-What is it that is so rotten, then?
-Almost everything.
Abba, Nitimen, the evening news, school, teachers -
- Gym teachers and Thorbjørn Egner,
-But what is wrong with Thorbjørn Egner?
-The Cardamom Act.
-What's wrong with it?
-It's a big, fat lie.
"You must not harass, but be nice and kind", "Otherwise you can do what you want,"
-Isn't that a form of anarchism?
-For the rest, perhaps,
The country is full of nice fantasies, Magnus.
The world is not good!
Oh no?
-You are quite famous, right?
-Well, I guess so.
I'm not trying to impress others.
I don't know that yet.
We will be called "Diå" We will not play well.
We will play like shit!
Shut up!
Punk is not supposed to sound good.
We will not play well.
We will play so loud that poor people will believe that Satan flies out of their arse!
-Why don't we just call it "Shit"?
-It's a crap name,
"Dirt", then?
What is it?
Do you know what punk is all about?
The word comes from Shakespeare's "Merry Wives of Windsor",
There is a person called Gun that uses the word "punk".
Shakespeare?
So, there is not a 100 people who know what punk means.
Those who have a clue, know that it means "junk" or "rabble."
You will have new names, too.
Tor Idiot.
Dastardly Niko.
And Viggo Ussel.
-And you, Anton?
-I shall be called ...
-Anton's Death.
-What?
-Anton's Death.
-Can that be a name?
It's the best name
Ok, play it through once.
One, two, three.,.
Yes?
Hello, Nancy.
Where will you end up, then, Gunnar, if you never try anything new?
If you only reproduce the anti-human, your lines will be unimaginative?
So you think that the whole Norwegian society should be like you -
- And never deviate from your norm?
Do you understand how monstrous that is?
Yes, but think of money for a fucking second!
We must sell the car.
Why are you doing this?
We've got to sell it.
Dad has stopped work.
We need money.
... And they would feel overwhelmed and bursting...
Oh my God!
Take dora!
I don't need to explain how angry we all are.
Teachers.
Parents, 17-May-committee.
Parents' Committee,
What happened on the National Day -
- Is something that I and everyone else would like to forget as soon as possible, but ...
Before we do, we need to identify and clean out the bad attitudes -
- Which led to this behavior.
Shame on you!
Do you hear me, punks?
!
Shame on you!
What happened here on Independence Day, is unacceptable!
It is the lowest and crudest form of communication.
Throw a bottle at -
- A man holding a speech?
No.
I have no words.
Anyone who does so should prepare for the most serious consequences!
-And this also applies to our fathers?
-Excuse me?
Feel free to denigrate these children's rebellious attitudes,
"They went too far," etc.
Honestly.
This here is a cloth case.
What clearly must be the most important theme here today -
- Is the serious assault to which they were subjected to by the mob of fathers -
- Who knocked them senseless, punched and kicked them in a barbaric fashion!
See what they have done to him!
It has come to my attention that the school caretakers also participated in the mob,
If you can verify that, the principal should know that he will be held accountable.
The relationship will naturally be prosecuted as soon as possible.
The head teacher should consider himself lucky if after this he can work at any school!
And all this violence, destructive behavior -
- Because of a tiny scratch on the forehead of a grown man?
What?
!
A beer bottle on the head is a small price to pay -
- For the healthy, rebellious attitude of these children.
I say hurray!
You should too.
That should be your mission, to teach students to rebel!
If a generation does not protest, the world will stagnate!
But this probably will not happen.
Let's get away from this man.
First, I just heard that infernal noise.
But it is a wonderful musical expression.

-What?
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, come on.
What do you think?
Now it's summer vacation.
It's been registered for two.
-Where will the second seat be, then?
-Here.
Get your toolbox,
This year, Nikolaj, this year you and I will have the world's best summer!
Doesn't it go, Niko?
"You old woman, you are overactive, you rock the High North..."
-Ai, ai!
-Oh, old friend!
-Good to see you.

Arne Dahlgren.
I am familiar with this wild one from school.

Yes, get undressed over there, I'll show you around.
-Shit!
-Don't be so cowardly now, Nicholas.
Don't you want to join in and see the cabinet Dahlgren has built?
Dahlgren has built a cabinet to ..
-Yes, it's completely innocent,
-Oh, yes,
Nicholas, I'll go and talk to them for a bit.
We have things inside us, Nikolaj.
There are forces there.
We live in a world hostile to the body, Nikolaj.
Nudity and sexuality are shameful,
I am experimenting to free the body.
I have made ​​my own version of Wilhelm Reich's Orgone cabinets.
Twenty minutes in the closet will allow you to loosen up, to flow more freely,
Just sit still, Nikolai.
Then you will feel a slight vibration in the body.
It is your life energy awakening,
All the energy that radiates from your body, all by itself.
It will be gathered up and thrown back!
Then you will feel that it flows more healthily ..
Hello!

Why are you wearing pants?

Hello!
It's the police, Nikolay!
Yes, good afternoon.
The police are out in the nice weather?
Yes, do you have a small vehicle registration certificate?
It should be in order.
Did you build this yourself?
Yes, I did.
I spent a number of hours in the garage at home making it.
This keeps it stable when we are driving,
Listen here.
If you go home and put your pants on you can go for a drive.
Push on!
Push on!
Hold on!
Oddvar Nordli rules the country!
Oddvar Nordli flies on the water!
No punk like him, Oddvar Nordli's our man!
Oddvar Nordli!
Oddvar Nordli!
What the hell?
If there's a gig, you must stop being so fucking far away, Niko.
Do you have anything on you, Viggo?
Relax.
It's slimming powder,
Us punks have to stay thin and awake,
Come on, we drive on!
It has taken me a long time to figure this out.
-The hidden plan.
-What secret plan?
See here.
See how Rykkinn is built?
As a funnel from which all movement points towards the CI Centre.
This place was not built to house people,
-Or to found a safe community.
-Why was it built, then?
In order to suck the dollars and cents out of residents here at the AI ​​center.
This is suburbia's hidden meaning, Rykkinn's real heart,
All this was built to create consumers of the municipality,
-And then?
-"So?"
Don't you realize that everything was a sham?
Bærum is a cannibal!
You will be eaten!
Every day you will be eaten alive!
Don't you know?
You will be eaten!
Eaten!
Hush, hush.
Is everything okay with you?
Yes, it worries me a little he is so seldom at school,
Yes, he is good in many subjects, but when he is so absent, ..
He has not been in a bad crowd?
You know, down at the AI center?
No, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.
I had written to the principal long ago.
I've decided to take Nikolai out of school for a while,
Teach him at home.
Yes, he is studying music now.
He sat and practiced late into the night yesterday.
The music is the basis for teaching program, which includes -
- Architecture, literature, philosophy.,.
Dear pig, show that you are smart!
Goggen, Goggen, Goggen, Goggen!
Goggen, Goggen, Goggen!
I talked with him at the Golden Arrow.
He heard the tape we sent, and, ..
We got a gig at the Arrow!
You were good, guys!
Bravo!
Hey.
Do you have any speed?
I have 250
-Now you can go.
-Good luck.
Viggo?
-Viggo!
-Damn, what's this!
-What's wrong with him?
-Just the flu.
It's something that goes.
Damn, Viggo!
This is the last song!
Now you can go.
-I can play well, if that.,.
-You little punk!
Being punk isn't about how old you are, it's all about ..
Yeah, what?
-To dare to be shit.
-But he can not even play!

In music school.
It will be alright.

Holy shit!
Damn!
Hell!
Punks are not fucking assholes!
Where the hell was your father?
Magnus!
Magnus?
-Has anyone told you that, Niko?
-What?
-You have cat eyes.
-What are you talking about?
People think cats are lazy animals, lazy zombies to be petted.
But the cat is a killing machine.
After being an indoor cat for eight years, its nature awakens.
Straight out to torture and murder, Nature is not sweet...
-What are you talking about?
-Is that something you would say?
I quit the band, Yes, you heard me!
We have never been so shit as we were today!
We were musical.
Cowardly little Niko, eh?
Had my father been on stage, I'd fucking die of shame!
What the hell are you doing?
!
I quit the band,
We have received a letter from the police.
"The case about your wife's death has been dropped."
Do you want cake?
I went out and bought it as soon as I got this letter.
It may seem a bit strange, but I thought, "This is a turning point,"
Now, life can go on.
We must lift our heads again now.
Lone would have wanted it.
There is plenty of life left for us to celebrate,
See here.
With strawberry cream, just like your mom liked.
Will you tell me something?
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
Can't you confide in me a little?
Help me a little, Nikolai.
I can not reach you.
It takes two to confide.
Mom would have liked this.
You need to eat more.
Eat a little more of Mom.
Take a real bite out of Mom.
Address?
Does your father know that you are out so late?
Answer me, damn it!
Head injuries are very serious.
There is nothing more we can do.
You can do something, right?
I understand that this is not easy to understand.
There is nothing we can do.
-Nothing?
-We just have to wait and see,
Look at it.
Look at all of it.
It's fucking bollocks, but I love it!
It's hilarious.
This is the world, and it is made of tiny little pieces of excrement.
Excrement?
Crap
Chaos is crap.
Personality is crap, everything is crap, but once you understand it, -
- You'll find in life that anything is possible.
Ah yes, freedom is shit.
Shit is freedom.
Once you understand this, anything is possible.
You must all put on your hats, boys,
Peter, please wait.
Look here.
We need to bring everything.
Come on, boys.
Happy Holidays!
Happy Holidays!
-Merry Christmas, my boy,
-Watch your neck, now!
Holy shit, I'm so glad to see all my boys again!
Gingerbread?
Gingerbread for all, hm?
Come then, Tor, Tor has a gift,
Just a little thing.
Thank you, brother.
Do you know that Anton is dead?
Your friend?
-Anton?
-Yes.
They found him at home two weeks ago.
He drowned in his own vomit, Niko.
Forgive me, boys.
I have not been myself.
I've been so confused, I have ...
I have been completely lost in all this,
So fucking confused.
Peter, we soaked Tor!
Now we go, boys.
So long, my boy!
Bye,
Happy Friday, everybody.
What are you doing this weekend?
The question is, who am I doing this weekend?
He's asking because he's already forgotten.
It's nobody.
I'm volunteering at the animal hospital.
- Aw.
- Animal hospital?
The animals are the patients.
That makes sense.
Yeah, Dr. Zizmor's letting me work off the cost of Daniel's eye surgery.
Wait.
You won't spend money on a name-brand phone, but you got lasik for your geriatric cat?
He only has the one eye, Jeff.
I can't exactly buy him a cat monocle, can I?
It's pretentious.
And for your information, this is a totorola.
Troy and I will be having a very special Saturday night, as in Dark Knight.
It came!
Our limited-edition, $299 Dark Knight DVD with bonus footage, special commentary, and a Christian Bale autograph, including a personalized message of up to four words!
"Abed is Batman now, Christian Bale."
- It's official.
- From the man himself.
May I have that back, Annie?
Thank you.
And just to clarify, if you see this lying out,
I'm still using it, so you don't have to take it to the kitchen, dump it out, and wash the bowl.
Is this about your buttered noodles?
I didn't say that.
- Yes!
- Into your face!
Your tears reveal your weakness!
What is it with those tools and foosball?
- They've been at it for weeks.
- I think they're European.
It's probably a more important game over there.
Foosball's like the soccer of ping-pong.
- I can't take it anymore.
- Oh, Jeffrey, let them be.
Gentlemen, my name is Clarence Thaddeus Foos.
My grandfather, Fletcher Morton Foos, invented this game for one purpose-- to have the loudest, dumbest thing happen.
Now it has.
The game of foosball is completed.
You're free to return to your undoubtedly hearing-impaired families.
Tell you what, we'll stop playing, if you can score a point on us.
Tempting, but then wouldn't I be playing foosball?
And, if so, how would I not be a loud, weird knob?
Free shot.
I'm not even touching the foosenschaften.
Sorry, luftballons.
I'm above it.
Boo-yah!
I wish there was a word to describe the pleasure I feel at viewing misfortune.
'Tis the face of a broken man.
Jeff.
Smile.
- Uh, uh...
- Ooh!
They, uh, -- they come in a six-pack.
♪ Give me some more time in a dream ♪
♪ give me the hope to run out of steam ♪
♪ somebody said we could be here ♪
♪ we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year ♪
♪ I can't count the reasons I should stay ♪
♪ one by one they all just fade away ♪
Oh--
Buttered noodles.
I'm allowed to throw out the dust, right?
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I-I...
Why?
- I stepped on it.
- Why?
- I was dusting the tv.
- Why?
I can run out and get a new one before he gets home.
Oh, sure, Annie.
And--and then we just have to record fake exclusive commentary by Christian Bale.
Go ahead, you first.
This scene was a special challenge
- to all involved--
- Stop it!
That's not a real option!
The disc is irreplaceably awesome!
What if we got a different disc, and--
Annie, do you know how many sitcoms have done the "secretly replace a broken, priceless item" thing?
'Cause Abed does.
Abed knows everything, and I know you think you can think your way out of this with your "thinkiness," but don't think too much.
You just have to confess.
- Okay?
- Okay.
We shot this scene on location--
Okay, he's right.
It won't work.
Jeffrey?
What--what are you doing?
Hmm?
Oh.
You know, I just thought...
Next time those deutsche-bags try to show off, maybe I can catch them by surprise.
Jeff, you don't need to worry what foreigners think about you.
That's your birthright as an American.
Okay...
Small confession.
I used to love foosball.
It was a great after-school game for a lonely kid with no dad-- you know, just masculine enough without having to know how to throw or catch.
I have seen you throw.
And it was fun...
Till I started getting bullied by people like those Germans.
So I quit.
Well, you did the right thing.
Foosball is a vile game for vile people.
Shirley, you wouldn't get it.
It's a guy thing.
It's not a fresh-baked-pie thing.
Well, I might get it a little.
You don't know me.
Ho...
Ly...
Crap.
All right, I think I figured out the viewing order-- original version, director's cut, director's cut with commentary, and then original version cool-down.
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God, you guys.
We've been robbed!
Oh, man.
I can't believe we got robbed.
Shirley, Shirley.
You have to teach me.
Please, help me beat those evil power krauts.
Don't you get it, Jeff?
They're not evil people that are good at foosball.
They are good at foosball because they're evil.
It's an evil game that brings out the worst in us, like--like out-of-town weddings where the reception's in the same place as everybody's rooms?
Great.
After three years of religious advice and carb-laden pastries, you finally have one thing I actually need, and--
I'm sorry.
Um, that was rude.
It--it shouldn't be so important to me.
I'll, uh...
I'll see you Monday.
Jeff...
Tomorrow, dawn-- be in the student lounge.
Shirley, you are the best.
Dear lord, please forgive me.
And please have mercy on him.
The stakes have never been higher.
Shut up, Leonard.
I found your YouTube page.
What's the point in reviewing frozen pizza?
You're talking about it.
Well, that is true.
Now, Jeffrey...
The key to winning foosball is to tap into your darkness, so I need you to promise you won't judge the side of me that might come out.
Shirley...
I'm gonna be perfectly blunt with you.
The few times that you've been a little bad are the times I've liked you most.
- Really?
- Remember making fun of Britta's boyfriend's tiny nipples?
Oh, yeah, they were tiny.
Remember what you did to Pierce's hoagie?
That was so disturbing, I almost proposed on the spot.
Now, come on, show me how to dominate.
All right, Winger, hands on the grips.
I'm coming up on your right side in three, two, one!
You know why you can't stop me?
'Cause I'm not playing a game.
For you, it's winning and losing.
For me, it's life and death.
That's how I win.
That's where you have to go.
No more thought, no more feeling.
Kill or be killed.
Kill or be killed, little man.
Think back to when this game mattered, before you got to be too cool.
Stop acting like you're not ashamed right now.
Follow that shame to the fear.
Follow that fear to the rage.
You put that rage-- aah!
Up your ass, Turkey.
Ha ha!
There's only two ways off this table-- kill or be killed.
- Say it.
- Kill or be killed.
I said say it, mumbles!
- Kill or be killed.
- Kill!
- Kill!
- Kill!
Kill!
Yeah!
You called me Turkey.
I love it.
Sorry we couldn't get a car over here until now.
Our captain was killed on duty last night.
My God, I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Good man-- leaves behind two kids and a pregnant wife.
So you're missing a Batman DVD?
My Dark Knight extended extended cut--it wasn't insured.
Well, there's no sign of forced entry on your door or windows.
You sure it wasn't just misplaced?
Someone definitely broke in.
Some of my jewelry's missing.
You sure about that, Annie?
Mm-hmm.
My necklace.
It was gold-- white gold-- with emeralds.
And my name engraved in Hebrew.
It was a bat mitzvah gift from my Nana.
She was a rockette.
She married a count.
He was blind.
He loved her for her mind.
That's good color for the report, but I got to be honest, small stuff like this almost never turns up.
- Oh, no, Abed.
- We'll be in touch.
Say...
You look familiar.
Did I ever pretend to shoot a guy in front of you to teach you about gun safety?
I'm really good at faces.
Well, I guess the only upside to this is it's brought us closer together as roommates.
Something doesn't add up.
If there was no forced entry, it had to be an inside job.
- We don't know that.
- And instead of taking cash, pharmaceuticals, laptops, they take what?
My Batman DVD, and one piece of oddly ornate Hebrew-themed jewelry?
- Nana gave it.
- It's smoke.
- It's a ruse, a lie.
- Hmm?
I think I know what happened here.
Abed, I--
The landlord did it.
It all makes sense.
Rick has keys to every apartment--means.
He knows when we're coming and going--opportunity.
And he was dressed as the Joker for Halloween--motive.
- Hmm.
- Something's got to be done.
Oh, let's not leap to thing-doing.
Right, Annie?
Double strike.
Got it.
Back blast.
Boom!
Viper shot.
- Nailed it!
- Oh, look...
How cute-- you do like foosball, you just have to practice with your mama.
What are you guys doing here on a Saturday night?
Shouldn't you be making weird art movies
- or well-engineered cars?
- You take that back!
We came to play.
Get away from our table.
- We're using it, strudel-brain.
- Nice.
Then play us for it.
Fine.
Monday morning-- only let's make it interesting.
The losers never get to use this table again.
Oh, you are so on that things have now become very much like Donkey Kong.
We're gonna kick das butt.
- Nice.
- Thank you.
Enough teutonic punnery.
Monday morning you get this...
Were you guys walking around with a soccer ball just so you could do that?
They left the ball and everything.
I think they were literally walking around with it like a prop to use.
That's, like, a $25 dollar bit, and it's not even that good.
You have got to come clean, okay?
I don't know what he's doing in there, but it feels dramatic.
I'm sure he's already moved on to some other obsession.
Oh, look, fun.
The police are powerless.
I must take justice into my own hands.
Men like Rick operate above the law.
But there's something else above the law...
Bats...
And me.
Abed, don't do anything drastic.
Yeah, maybe we should all just take a step back and--
Aw, is that the grappling hook I got you for Christmas?
The night beckons.
Its black fingers curl and uncurl, going, like, "hey, come here."
Abed, wait!
Wait.
I did it.
I stepped on your DVD, and it broke, and I staged a break-in to cover it up.
If that were true, you would've come forward a long time ago.
You're lying to keep me out of danger.
But there can be no peace while crime spits and dances on the grave of justice to the hot beats of infectious rhythms of all that is wrong.
- Oh!
- Just...
- Use your foot.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
You're okay--okay.
Ooh!
Abed...
- Oh!
- Oh!
Troy!
What are we gonna do?
Now you're open to input?
I'm following him.
You moving in here was supposed to tone us down.
So, Shirley, tell me-- how does someone with your talent for foosball ever stop playing?
Oh, I don't want to talk about that.
Oh, come on, we're, like, best friends now.
Don't back away from this.
Open up to me.
Okay, well...
When I was a kid, I had anger, Jeff-- real bad anger-- and foosball was a release.
But I didn't just-- just beat people.
I-I broke 'em.
One time I was running this table over at this Y.M.C.A across town, and I was really giving it to this kid-- this skinny little white boy, no offense.
He started crying.
They always started crying.
But something about this boy made me want to take it all the way.
I started jabbing him with the rods until...
The boy peed himself.
Everybody laughed.
I laughed.
But after that, the game lost its flavor.
Once you make a boy pee his pants, you start thinking about where your life is headed.
Jeff, what's wrong?
Gonna kill you!
Your ass is mine!
You're such a punk!
You like being beat by a girl?
Yes!
What are you crying for?
Your mama cannot help you, and I know your daddy ain't around, or you wouldn't play like a bitch.
Ha!
Ooh.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Is that what I think?
I just beat this kid all the way to tinkle-town.
Tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town.
Tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town.
You were Big Cheddar?
Who told you that--
Oh, dear lord.
You're tinkle-town?
Don't call me that.
All your fake sweetness and religion is just a veil covering a horrible monster.
And I had a lot of Mountain Dew that day!
There's an 80 percent chance you can't leave Woodstock until you bone these hippies.
Oh, boy.
Aah!
You know what I came for, scum.
Where is it?
In the closet.
In the closet, man.
- Abed, stop it!
- Get him!
I mean, stop it.
They're in the closet.
I knew I'd get caught.
Just don't hurt me, Batman.
Closet.
Women's shoes?
But Rick doesn't have a wife...
Or women's feet.
Wait.
My summertime ballet flats?
I thought I lost these in the move.
Is it there?
Does he have the DVD?
- The what?
- The DVD.
He has it, all right.
And it looks like he broke it.
Ah.
Who are you?
If you had something to say, why not put it in the text message?
I wasn't sure what to say.
Do you understand what you did to me...
Big Cheddar?
Please don't call me that.
Why not?
It's what you are-- a mean, nasty bully.
I was 12 years old.
I peed!
I had to change schools.
I changed everything-- my clothes, my hair, my personality-- because of you.
What a waste.
I wish I could take a picture of you right now and send it to my ten-year-old self.
Watch it, Winger.
You don't have a trademark on self-pity.
- I will defend myself.
- Good.
Bring the cheddar...
Big Cheddar.
I'm gonna put you on the express train back to tinkle-town!
- Argh!
- Uh!
Uh!
Aah!
- Uh!
- Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Ah!
- Die!
- Never!
Argh!
Argh!
Ah!
- You get it.
- No, you get it.
You're the one that needs the advantage.
Wrong.
Wrong!
Every game I ever won, I won fairly.
Foosball was how I measured my value as a man.
You took that away!
Why do think I had to?
You try sprouting three feet just when boys are about to look at you.
Everyone stopped liking me.
This game is all I had.
- It's all I had.
- Well, that's stupid.
You're a perfectly fine person.
So are you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry, Jeff.
You don't have anything to be sorry for, Shirley.
So Rick has agreed to stay out of your apartment as long as you stay out of his.
And I'm getting tired of saying this to people, but these things wouldn't happen if you'd invest in a simple shoe safe.
That's it?
Now we just live upstairs from this...
Guy that's really into footwear?
Sweetie, you're a renter.
Look forward to owning a house.
Be glad he's not into heads.
Thanks for your help, officer, and if you should ever need me,
I usually get out of school around 4:00.
This guys sleeps outside your room, though, and that's okay?
Uh...
There's one thing I don't understand.
Why would Rick deny taking my DVD?
And why break it?
Well, maybe he stepped on it by accident and felt really, really, really bad.
All the more reason to confess.
Well, not everybody's perfect, Abed.
Batman.
And I am.
Well, Batman, on behalf of all of us that aren't perfect, can I just say I'm sorry I broke your DVD?
Apology accepted.
But I wouldn't mention it to Abed.
That guy's pretty ruthless.
And that's coming from Batman.
Hey, guys.
Abed, where have you been?
Troy, really?
Let it go.
Aw, black in the house!
- My hand is cramping.
- It's fine.
Oh.
Hey, freudenkatzen.
Ready for your schpankin'?
Just like we practiced?
Let's shut 'em down.
Ha ha ha.
Let's dance, David Bowie.
Get the ball, Karl.
I'm trying, and stop yelling at me.
Stop being such a schvine!
Aren't you guys playing foosball?
We've played enough for one lifetime.
We're gonna go see a movie.
Since when are those two so close?
Hello.
This is November 29th and I'm Leonard, and today I'm reviewing.
Eugenio's four cheese frozen pizza.
That's $5.99 at Kroger's.
I've tried it before, and we'll see.
Mmm!
Mmm, the cheese is good.
The sauce is good too.
Mm, well, it's definitely a buy.
Eugenio's four cheese frozen pizza-- a buy.
See you next time.
♪ I'm as high as hell ♪
♪ and you're about to get shot ♪
Happy Friday, everybody.
What are you doing this weekend?
The question is, who am I doing this weekend?
He's asking because he's already forgotten.

Kill!
Yeah!
You called me Turkey.
I love it.
Sorry we couldn't get a car over here until now.
Our captain was killed on duty last night.
My God, I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Good man-- leaves behind two kids and a pregnant wife.
So you're missing a Batman DVD?
My Dark Knight extended extended cut--it wasn't insured.
Well, there's no sign of forced entry on your door or windows.
You sure it wasn't just misplaced?
Someone definitely broke in.
Some of my jewelry's missing.
You sure about that, Annie?
Mm-hmm.
My necklace.
It was gold-- white gold-- with emeralds.
And my name engraved in Hebrew.
It was a bat mitzvah gift from my Nana.
She was a rockette.
She married a count.
He was blind.
He loved her for her mind.
That's good color for the report, but I got to be honest, small stuff like this almost never turns up.
- Oh, no, Abed.
- We'll be in touch.
Say...
You look familiar.
Did I ever pretend to shoot a guy in front of you to teach you about gun safety?
I'm really good at faces.
Well, I guess the only upside to this is it's brought us closer together as roommates.
Something doesn't add up.
If there was no forced entry, it had to be an inside job.
- We don't know that.
- And instead of taking cash, pharmaceuticals, laptops, they take what?
My Batman DVD, and one piece of oddly ornate Hebrew-themed jewelry?
- Nana gave it.
- It's smoke.
- It's a ruse, a lie.
- Hmm?
I think I know what happened here.
Abed, I--
The landlord did it.
It all makes sense.
Rick has keys to every apartment--means.
He knows when we're coming and going--opportunity.
And he was dressed as the Joker for Halloween--motive.
- Hmm.
- Something's got to be done.
Oh, let's not leap to thing-doing.
Right, Annie?
Double strike.
Got it.
Back blast.
Boom!
Viper shot.
- Nailed it!
- Oh, look...
How cute-- you do like foosball, you just have to practice with your mama.
What are you guys doing here on a Saturday night?
Shouldn't you be making weird art movies
- or well-engineered cars?
- You take that back!
We came to play.
Get away from our table.
- We're using it, strudel-brain.
- Nice.
Then play us for it.
Fine.
Monday morning-- only let's make it interesting.
The losers never get to use this table again.
Oh, you are so on that things have now become very much like Donkey Kong.
We're gonna kick das butt.
- Nice.
- Thank you.
Enough teutonic punnery.
Monday morning you get this...
Were you guys walking around with a soccer ball just so you could do that?
They left the ball and everything.
I think they were literally walking around with it like a prop to use.
That's, like, a $25 dollar bit, and it's not even that good.
You have got to come clean, okay?
I don't know what he's doing in there, but it feels dramatic.
I'm sure he's already moved on to some other obsession.
Oh, look, fun.
The police are powerless.
I must take justice into my own hands.
Men like Rick operate above the law.
But there's something else above the law...
Bats...
And me.
Abed, don't do anything drastic.
Yeah, maybe we should all just take a step back and--
Aw, is that the grappling hook I got you for Christmas?
The night beckons.
Its black fingers curl and uncurl, going, like, "hey, come here."
Abed, wait!
Wait.
I did it.
I stepped on your DVD, and it broke, and I staged a break-in to cover it up.
If that were true, you would've come forward a long time ago.
You're lying to keep me out of danger.
But there can be no peace while crime spits and dances on the grave of justice to the hot beats of infectious rhythms of all that is wrong.
- Oh!
- Just...
- Use your foot.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
You're okay--okay.
Ooh!
Abed...
- Oh!
- Oh!
Troy!
What are we gonna do?
Now you're open to input?
I'm following him.
You moving in here was supposed to tone us down.
So, Shirley, tell me-- how does someone with your talent for foosball ever stop playing?
Oh, I don't want to talk about that.
Oh, come on, we're, like, best friends now.
Don't back away from this.
Open up to me.
Okay, well...
When I was a kid, I had anger, Jeff-- real bad anger-- and foosball was a release.
But I didn't just-- just beat people.
I-I broke 'em.
One time I was running this table over at this Y.M.C.A across town, and I was really giving it to this kid-- this skinny little white boy, no offense.
He started crying.
They always started crying.
But something about this boy made me want to take it all the way.
I started jabbing him with the rods until...
The boy peed himself.
Everybody laughed.
I laughed.
But after that, the game lost its flavor.
Once you make a boy pee his pants, you start thinking about where your life is headed.
Jeff, what's wrong?
Gonna kill you!
Your ass is mine!
You're such a punk!
You like being beat by a girl?
Yes!
What are you crying for?
Your mama cannot help you, and I know your daddy ain't around, or you wouldn't play like a bitch.
Ha!
Ooh.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Is that what I think?
I just beat this kid all the way to tinkle-town.
Tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town.
Tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town, tinkle-town.
You were Big Cheddar?
Who told you that--
Oh, dear lord.
You're tinkle-town?
Don't call me that.
All your fake sweetness and religion is just a veil covering a horrible monster.
And I had a lot of Mountain Dew that day!
There's an 80 percent chance you can't leave Woodstock until you bone these hippies.
Oh, boy.
Aah!
You know what I came for, scum.
Where is it?
In the closet.
In the closet, man.
- Abed, stop it!
- Get him!
I mean, stop it.
They're in the closet.
I knew I'd get caught.
Just don't hurt me, Batman.
Closet.
Women's shoes?
But Rick doesn't have a wife...
Or women's feet.
Wait.
My summertime ballet flats?
I thought I lost these in the move.
Is it there?
Does he have the DVD?
- The what?
- The DVD.
He has it, all right.
And it looks like he broke it.
Ah.
Who are you?
If you had something to say, why not put it in the text message?
I wasn't sure what to say.
Do you understand what you did to me...
Big Cheddar?
Please don't call me that.
Why not?
It's what you are-- a mean, nasty bully.
I was 12 years old.
I peed!
I had to change schools.
I changed everything-- my clothes, my hair, my personality-- because of you.
What a waste.
I wish I could take a picture of you right now and send it to my ten-year-old self.
Watch it, Winger.
You don't have a trademark on self-pity.
- I will defend myself.
- Good.
Bring the cheddar...
Big Cheddar.
I'm gonna put you on the express train back to tinkle-town!
- Argh!
- Uh!
Uh!
Aah!
- Uh!
- Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Ah!
- Die!
- Never!
Argh!
Argh!
Ah!
- You get it.
- No, you get it.
You're the one that needs the advantage.
Wrong.
Wrong!
Every game I ever won, I won fairly.
Foosball was how I measured my value as a man.
You took that away!
Why do think I had to?
You try sprouting three feet just when boys are about to look at you.
Everyone stopped liking me.
This game is all I had.
- It's all I had.
- Well, that's stupid.
You're a perfectly fine person.
So are you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry, Jeff.
You don't have anything to be sorry for, Shirley.
So Rick has agreed to stay out of your apartment as long as you stay out of his.
And I'm getting tired of saying this to people, but these things wouldn't happen if you'd invest in a simple shoe safe.
That's it?
Now we just live upstairs from this...
Guy that's really into footwear?
Sweetie, you're a renter.
Look forward to owning a house.
Be glad he's not into heads.
Thanks for your help, officer, and if you should ever need me,
I usually get out of school around 4:00.
This guys sleeps outside your room, though, and that's okay?
Uh...
There's one thing I don't understand.
Why would Rick deny taking my DVD?
And why break it?
Well, maybe he stepped on it by accident and felt really, really, really bad.
All the more reason to confess.
Well, not everybody's perfect, Abed.
Batman.
And I am.
Well, Batman, on behalf of all of us that aren't perfect, can I just say I'm sorry I broke your DVD?
Apology accepted.
But I wouldn't mention it to Abed.
That guy's pretty ruthless.
And that's coming from Batman.
Hey, guys.
Abed, where have you been?
Troy, really?
Let it go.
Aw, black in the house!
- My hand is cramping.
- It's fine.
Oh.
Hey, freudenkatzen.
Ready for your schpankin'?
Just like we practiced?
Let's shut 'em down.
Ha ha ha.
Let's dance, David Bowie.
Get the ball, Karl.
I'm trying, and stop yelling at me.
Stop being such a schvine!
Aren't you guys playing foosball?
We've played enough for one lifetime.
We're gonna go see a movie.
Since when are those two so close?
Hello.
This is November 29th and I'm Leonard, and today I'm reviewing.
Eugenio's four cheese frozen pizza.
That's $5.99 at Kroger's.
I've tried it before, and we'll see.
Mmm!
Mmm, the cheese is good.
The sauce is good too.
Mm, well, it's definitely a buy.
Eugenio's four cheese frozen pizza-- a buy.
See you next time.
♪ I'm as high as hell ♪
♪ and you're about to get shot ♪
Happy Friday, everybody.
What are you doing this weekend?
The question is, who am I doing this weekend?
He's asking because he's already forgotten.
It's nobody.
I'm volunteering at the animal hospital.
- Aw.
- Animal hospital?
The animals are the patients.
That makes sense.
Yeah, Dr. Zizmor's letting me work off the cost of Daniel's eye surgery.
Wait.
You won't spend money on a name-brand phone, but you got lasik for your geriatric cat?
He only has the one eye, Jeff.
I can't exactly buy him a cat monocle, can I?
It's pretentious.
And for your information, this is a totorola.
[Men cheering loudly]
Troy and I will be having a very special Saturday night, as in Dark Knight.
It came!
Our limited-edition, $299 Dark Knight DVD with bonus footage, special commentary, and a Christian Bale autograph, including a personalized message of up to four words!
"Abed is Batman now, Christian Bale."
- It's official.
- From the man himself.
May I have that back, Annie?
Thank you.
And just to clarify, if you see this lying out,
I'm still using it, so you don't have to take it to the kitchen, dump it out, and wash the bowl.
Is this about your buttered noodles?
I didn't say that.
[Men shouting]
- Yes!
- Into your face!
Your tears reveal your weakness!
What is it with those tools and foosball?
- They've been at it for weeks.
- I think they're European.
It's probably a more important game over there.
Foosball's like the soccer of ping-pong.
[Men chanting]
- I can't take it anymore.
- Oh, Jeffrey, let them be.
Gentlemen, my name is Clarence Thaddeus Foos.
My grandfather, Fletcher Morton Foos, invented this game for one purpose-- to have the loudest, dumbest thing happen.
Now it has.
The game of foosball is completed.
You're free to return to your undoubtedly hearing-impaired families.
[German accent] Tell you what, we'll stop playing, if you can score a point on us.
Tempting, but then wouldn't I be playing foosball?
And, if so, how would I not be a loud, weird knob?
[German accent] Free shot.
I'm not even touching the foosenschaften.
Sorry, luftballons.
I'm above it.
[Men cheering] Boo-yah!
I wish there was a word to describe the pleasure I feel at viewing misfortune.
'Tis the face of a broken man.
Jeff.
Smile.
[Electrical popping]
- Uh, uh...
- Ooh!
They, uh, -- they come in a six-pack.
♪ Give me some more time in a dream ♪
♪ give me the hope to run out of steam ♪
♪ somebody said we could be here ♪
♪ we could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year ♪
♪ I can't count the reasons I should stay ♪
♪ one by one they all just fade away ♪
Oh-- [Breathes deeply]
Buttered noodles.
I'm allowed to throw out the dust, right?
Yeah.
[Crunch]
[Gasps]
[Troy humming]
What's wrong?
I-I...
[Gasps]
Why?
- I stepped on it.
- Why?
- I was dusting the tv.
- Why?
I can run out and get a new one before he gets home.
Oh, sure, Annie.
And--and then we just have to record fake exclusive commentary by Christian Bale.
Go ahead, you first.
[Gravelly voice] This scene was a special challenge
- to all involved--
- Stop it!
That's not a real option!
The disc is irreplaceably awesome!
[Normal voice] What if we got a different disc, and--
Annie, do you know how many sitcoms have done the "secretly replace a broken, priceless item" thing?
'Cause Abed does.
Abed knows everything, and I know you think you can think your way out of this with your "thinkiness," but don't think too much.
You just have to confess.
- Okay?
- Okay.
[Humming sadly]
[Gravelly voice] We shot this scene on location--
[Normal voice] Okay, he's right.
It won't work.
[Ball rattling]
Jeffrey?
What--what are you doing?
Hmm?
Oh.
You know, I just thought...
Next time those deutsche-bags try to show off, maybe I can catch them by surprise.
Jeff, you don't need to worry what foreigners think about you.
That's your birthright as an American.
[Sighs] Okay...
Small confession.
I used to love foosball.
It was a great after-school game for a lonely kid with no dad-- you know, just masculine enough without having to know how to throw or catch.
I have seen you throw.
And it was fun...
Till I started getting bullied by people like those Germans.
So I quit.
Well, you did the right thing.
Foosball is a vile game for vile people.
Shirley, you wouldn't get it.
It's a guy thing.
It's not a fresh-baked-pie thing.
Well, I might get it a little.
[Grunts angrily]
You don't know me.
Ho...
Ly...
Crap.
All right, I think I figured out the viewing order-- original version, director's cut, director's cut with commentary, and then original version cool-down.
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God, you guys.
We've been robbed!
[Weeping]
Oh, man.
I can't believe we got robbed.
Shirley, Shirley.
You have to teach me.
Please, help me beat those evil power krauts.
Don't you get it, Jeff?
They're not evil people that are good at foosball.
They are good at foosball because they're evil.
It's an evil game that brings out the worst in us, like--like out-of-town weddings where the reception's in the same place as everybody's rooms?
Great.
After three years of religious advice and carb-laden pastries, you finally have one thing I actually need, and--
I'm sorry.
Um, that was rude.
[Sighs] It--it shouldn't be so important to me.
I'll, uh...
I'll see you Monday.
Jeff...
Tomorrow, dawn-- be in the student lounge.
Shirley, you are the best.
Dear lord, please forgive me.
And please have mercy on him.
The stakes have never been higher.
Shut up, Leonard.
I found your YouTube page.
What's the point in reviewing frozen pizza?
You're talking about it.
Well, that is true.
Now, Jeffrey...
The key to winning foosball is to tap into your darkness, so I need you to promise you won't judge the side of me that might come out.
Shirley...
I'm gonna be perfectly blunt with you.
The few times that you've been a little bad are the times I've liked you most.
- Really?
- Remember making fun of Britta's boyfriend's tiny nipples?
Oh, yeah, they were tiny.
Remember what you did to Pierce's hoagie?
That was so disturbing, I almost proposed on the spot.
Now, come on, show me how to dominate.
All right, Winger, hands on the grips.
I'm coming up on your right side in three, two, one!
You know why you can't stop me?
'Cause I'm not playing a game.
For you, it's winning and losing.
For me, it's life and death.
[Grunts angrily]
That's how I win.
That's where you have to go.
No more thought, no more feeling.
Kill or be killed.
Kill or be killed, little man.
Think back to when this game mattered, before you got to be too cool.
[Grunts angrily]
Stop acting like you're not ashamed right now.
Follow that shame to the fear.
Follow that fear to the rage.
You put that rage-- aah!
Up your ass, Turkey.
Ha ha!
There's only two ways off this table-- kill or be killed.
- Say it.
- Kill or be killed.
I said say it, mumbles!
- Kill or be killed.
- Kill!
- Kill!
- Kill!
Both:
Kill!
Yeah!
You called me Turkey.
I love it.
[Growls softly]
Sorry we couldn't get a car over here until now.
Our captain was killed on duty last night.
My God, I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Good man-- leaves behind two kids and a pregnant wife.

- My hand is cramping.
- It's fine.
Oh.
Hey, freudenkatzen.
Ready for your schpankin'?
Just like we practiced?
Let's shut 'em down.
Ha ha ha.
Let's dance, David Bowie.
Get the ball, Karl.
I'm trying, and stop yelling at me.
Stop being such a schvine!
Aren't you guys playing foosball?
We've played enough for one lifetime.
We're gonna go see a movie.
[Giggles]
Since when are those two so close?
Hello.
This is November 29th and I'm Leonard, and today I'm reviewing.
Eugenio's four cheese frozen pizza.
That's $5.99 at Kroger's.
I've tried it before, and we'll see.
Mmm!
Mmm, the cheese is good.
The sauce is good too.
Mm, well, it's definitely a buy.
Eugenio's four cheese frozen pizza-- a buy.
See you next time.
♪ I'm as high as hell ♪
♪ and you're about to get shot ♪
Happy Friday, everybody.
What are you doing this weekend?
The question is, who am I doing this weekend?
He's asking 'cause he's forgotten.
It's nobody.
I'm volunteering at the animal hospital.
- Animal hospital?
- The animals are the patients.
That makes sense.
Dr. Zizmor's letting me work off the cost of Daniel's eye surgery.
You won't spend money on a name-brand phone, but you got lasik for your geriatric cat?
He only has the one eye, Jeff.
I can't exactly buy him a cat monocle, can I?
It's pretentious.
And for your information, this is a Totorola.
We will be having a very special Saturday night, as in Dark Knight.
It came!
Our limited-edition, $299 Dark Knight DVD with bonus footage, special commentary, and a Christian Bale autograph, including a personalized message of up to four words!
Abed is Batman now, Christian Bale.
- It's official.
- From the man himself.
May I have that back?
Thanks.
If you see this lying out, I'm using it, you don't have
- to dump it out, and wash the bowl.
- Is this about your buttered noodles?
I didn't say that.
- Into your face!
- Your tears reveal your weakness!
What is with those tools and foosball?
They've been at it for weeks.
I think they're European.
Probably a important game over there.
Foosball's like the soccer of ping-pong.
- I can't take it anymore.
- Jeffrey, let them be.
Gentlemen, my name is Clarence Thaddeus Foos.
My grandfather, Fletcher Morton Foos, invented this game for one purpose:
to have the loudest, dumbest thing happen.
Now it has.
The game of foosball is completed.
You're free to return to your undoubtedly hearing-impaired families.
Tell you what, we'll stop playing, if you can score a point on us.
Tempting, but then wouldn't I be playing foosball?
And, if so, how would I not be a loud, weird knob?
Free shot.
I'm not even touching the foosenschaften.
Sorry, luftballons.
I'm above it.
I wish there was a word to describe the pleasure I feel at viewing misfortune.
'Tis the face of a broken man.
Jeff.
Smile.
They come in a six-pack.
- Feygnasse Team -

3x09:
Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism
Buttered noodles.
I'm allowed to throw out the dust, right?
What's wrong?
Why?
- I stepped on it.
- Why?
- I was dusting the TV.
- Why?
I can run out and get a new one.
Sure, Annie.
And then we just have to record fake exclusive commentary by Christian Bale.
Go ahead, you first.
This scene was a special challenge to all involved...
That's not a real option!
The disc is irreplaceably awesome!
What if we got a different disc, and...
Annie, do you know how many sitcoms have done the "secretly replace a broken, priceless item" thing?
'Cause Abed does.
Abed knows everything, and I know you think you can think your way out of this with your "thinkiness,"
but don't think too much.
You just have to confess.
We shot this scene on location.
Okay, he's right.
It won't work.
Jeffrey?
What are you doing?
You know, I just thought...
Next time those Deutsche-bags try to show off, maybe I can catch them by surprise.
You don't need to worry what foreigners think about you.
That's your birthright as an American.
Small confession.
I used to love foosball.
It was a great after-school game for a lonely kid with no dad.
Just masculine enough without having to know how to throw or catch.
I have seen you throw.
And it was fun...
'Till I started getting bullied by people like those Germans.
So I quit.
Well, you did the right thing.
Foosball is a vile game for vile people.
You wouldn't get it.
It's a guy thing.
It's not a fresh-baked-pie thing.
Well, I might get it a little.
You don't know me.
Ho...
Ly...
Crap.
I think I figured out the viewing order.
Original version, director's cut, director's cut with commentary, and then original version cool-down.
Yeah, we'll see.
Oh, my God, you guys.
We've been robbed!
I can't believe we got robbed.
You have to teach me.
Please, help me beat those evil power krauts.
Don't you get it, Jeff?
They're not evil people that are good at foosball.
They are good at foosball because they're evil.
It's an evil game that brings out the worst in us, like a wedding where the reception's in the same place as everybody's rooms?
Great.
After three years of religious advice and carb-laden pastries, you finally have one thing I actually need, and...
I'm sorry.
That was rude.
It shouldn't be so important to me.
I'll see you Monday.
Tomorrow, dawn.
Be in the student lounge.
Shirley, you are the best.
Dear Lord, please forgive me.
And please have mercy on him.
The stakes have never been higher.
Shut up, Leonard.
I found your Youtube page.
What's the point in reviewing frozen pizza?
You're talking about it.
Well, that is true.
Jeffrey, the key to winning foosball is to tap into your darkness,
I need you to promise you won't judge the side of me that might come out.
I'm gonna be perfectly blunt with you.
The few times you've been a little bad are the times I've liked you most.
Really?
Remember joking of Britta's boyfriend's nipples?
- Yeah, they were tiny.
- And what you did to Pierce's hoagie?
That was so disturbing, I almost proposed on the spot.
Now, come on, show me how to dominate.
All right, Winger, hands on the grips.
I'm coming up on your right side in three, two, one!
You know why you can't stop me?
'Cause I'm not playing a game.
For you, it's winning and losing.
For me, it's life and death.
That's how I win.
That's where you have to go.
No more thought, no more feeling.
Kill or be killed.
Kill or be killed.
Kill, little man.
Think back to when this game mattered, before you got to be too cool.
Stop acting like you're not ashamed.
Follow that shame to the fear.
Follow that fear to the rage.
You put that rage!
Up your ass, turkey.
There's only two ways off this table:
Kill or be killed.
Say it.
- Kill or be killed.
- Say it!
- Kill or be killed.
- Kill!
You called me turkey.
I love it.
Sorry we couldn't get a car over here until now.
Our captain was killed on duty last night.
My God, I'm so sorry.
Good man.
Leaves behind two kids and a pregnant wife.
So you're missing a Batman DVD?
My Dark Knight extended extended cut-it wasn't insured.
There's no sign of forced entry on your door or windows.
You sure it wasn't just misplaced?
Someone definitely broke in.
Some of my jewelry's missing.
You sure about that?
My necklace.
It was gold.
White gold.
With emeralds.
And my name engraved in Hebrew.
It was a Bat Mitzvah gift from my nana.
She was a rockette.
She married a count.
He was blind.
He loved her for her mind.
That's good color for the report, but I got to be honest, small stuff like this almost never turns up.
- Oh, no, Abed.
- We'll be in touch.
Say...
You look familiar.
Did I ever pretend to shoot a guy in front of you to teach you gun safety?
I'm really good at faces.
I guess the only upside to this is it's brought us closer together.
Something doesn't add up.
If there was no forced entry, it had to be an inside job.
- We don't know.
- Instead of cash, pharmaceuticals, laptops, they take what?
My Batman DVD, and one piece of oddly ornate Hebrew-themed jewelry?
- Nana gave it.
- It's smoke.
It's a ruse, a lie.
I think I know what happened here.
The landlord did it.
It all makes sense.
Rick has keys to every apartment-means.
He knows when we're coming and going-opportunity.
And he was dressed as the Joker for Halloween-motive.
Something's got to be done.
Let's not leap to thing-doing.
Right, Annie?
Double strike.
- Got it.
- Back blast.
Viper shot.
- Nailed it!
- Look...
How cute.
You do like foosball, you just have to practice with your mama.
What are you doing here tonight?
Shouldn't you be making weird movies or well-engineered cars?
- You take that back!
- We came to play.
Leave our table.
- We're using it.
- Nice.
- Then play us for it.
- Fine.
Monday morning.
Let's make it interesting.
The losers never get to use this table again.
You are so on that things have now become very much like Donkey Kong.
- We're gonna kick das butt.
- Nice.
Enough Teutonic Punnery.
Monday morning, you get this...
Were you carrying a soccer ball just so you could do that?
They left the ball and everything.
I think they were walking around with it like a prop to use.
That's a $25 dollar bit, and it's not even that good.
You've got to come clean.
What he's doing there feels dramatic.
I'm sure he's already moved on to some other obsession.
- Fun.
- The police are powerless.
I must take justice into my own hands.
Men like Rick operate above the law.
But there's something else above the law...
Bats...
And me.
Abed, don't do anything drastic.
Yeah, we should all just take a step back and...
Is that the grappling hook I got you for Christmas?
The night beckons.
Its black fingers curl and uncurl, going, like, "hey, come here."
Abed, wait!
Wait.
I did it.
I stepped on your DVD, and it broke, and I staged a break-in to cover it up.
If that were true, you would've tell me a long time ago.
You're lying to keep me out of danger.
But there can be no peace while crime dances on the grave of justice to the hot beats of infectious rhythms.
All that is wrong.
Use your foot.
Troy!
What are we gonna do?
- Now you're open to input?
- I'm following him.
You moving in here was supposed to tone us down.
So, Shirley, tell me, how does someone with your talent for foosball ever stop playing?
- I don't want to talk about that.
- Come on, we're best friends now.
Don't back away from this.
Open up to me.
When I was a kid, I had anger, Jeff.
Real bad anger.
And foosball was a release.
But I didn't just beat people.
I broke 'em.
One time I was running this table over at this YMCA across town.
I was really giving it to this kid.
This skinny little white, no offense.
He started crying.
They always started crying.
But something about him made me want to continue.
I started jabbing him with the rods until...
The boy peed himself.
Everybody laughed.
I laughed, but...
After that, the game lost its flavor.
Once you make a boy pee his pants, you start thinking about your life.
Jeff, what's wrong?
Gonna kill you!
Your ass is mine!
You're such a punk!
You like being beat by a girl?
What are you crying for?
Your mama cannot help you, and I know your daddy ain't around, or you wouldn't play like a bitch.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Is that what I think?
I just beat this kid all the way to tinkle-town.
Tinkle-town, tinkle-town.
You were Big Cheddar?
Who told you that...
Dear Lord.
You're tinkle-town?
Don't call me that.
All your fake sweetness and religion is just a veil covering a horrible monster.
And I had a lot of Mountain Dew that day!
Sam, Ziggy's saying there's an 80% chance you can't leave Woodstock until you bone these hippies.
You know what I came for, scum.
Where is it?
In the closet.
In the closet, man.
- Abed, stop it!
- Get him!
I mean, stop it.
They're in the closet.
I knew I'd get caught.
Just don't hurt me, Batman.
Closet.
Women's shoes?
But Rick doesn't have a wife...
Or women's feet.
Wait.
My summertime ballet flats?
I thought I lost these in the move.
Is it there?
Does he have the DVD?
- The what?
- The DVD.
He has it, all right.
And it looks like he broke it.
Who are you?
If you had something to say, why not put it in the text message?
I wasn't sure what to say.
Do you understand what you did to me, Big Cheddar?
Please don't call me that.
Why not?
It's what you are-
A mean, nasty bully.
I was 12 years old.
I peed!
I had to change schools.
I changed everything:
My clothes, my hair, my personality.
Because of you.
What a waste.
I wish I could take a picture of you and send it to my ten-year-old self.
Watch it, Winger.
You don't have a trademark on self-pity.
I will defend myself.
Good.
Bring the Cheddar...
Big Cheddar.
I'm gonna put you on the express train back to tinkle-town!
- Die!
- Never!
- You get it.
- You get it.
You're need the advantage.
Wrong.
Wrong!
Every game I ever won, I won fairly.
Foosball was how I measured my value as a man.
- You took that away!
- Why do think I had to?
You try sprouting three feet when boys are about to look at you.
Everyone stopped liking me.
This game is all I had.
- It's all I had.
- That's stupid.
You're a perfectly fine person.
So are you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry, Jeff.
You don't have anything to be sorry for.
Rick has agreed to stay out of your apartment as long as you stay out of his.
I'm getting tired of saying this, but these things wouldn't happen if you'd invest in a simple shoe safe.
That's it?
Now we just live upstairs from this... guy that's really into footwear?
Sweetie, you're a renter.
Look forward to owning a house.
Be glad he's not into heads.
Thanks for your help, officer, and if you should ever need me,
I usually get out of school around 4:00.
This guys sleeps outside your room, though, and that's okay?
There's one thing I don't understand.
Why would Rick deny taking my DVD?
And why break it?
Well, maybe he stepped on it by accident and felt really, really, really bad.
All the more reason to confess.
Not everybody's perfect.
Batman.
And I am.
Well, Batman, on behalf of all of us that aren't perfect, can I just say I'm sorry I broke your DVD?
Apology accepted.
But I wouldn't mention it to Abed.
That guy's pretty ruthless.
And that's coming from Batman.
Abed, where have you been?
Troy, really?
Let it go.
Black in the house!
- My hand is cramping.
- It's fine.
Hey, Freudenkatzen.
Ready for your schpankin'?
- Just like we practiced?
- Let's shut 'em down.
Let's dance, David Bowie.
Get the ball, Karl.
I'm trying, and stop yelling at me.
Stop being such a schvine!
- Aren't you guys playing foosball?
- We've played enough for one lifetime.
We're gonna go see a movie.
Since when are those two so close?
Well, this is november 29th, and I'm Leonard, and today I'm reviewing
Eugenio's four cheese frozen pizza.
That's $5.99 at Kroger's.
I've tried it before, and we'll see.
The cheese is good.
The sauce is good too.
Well, it's definitely a buy.
Eugenio's four cheese frozen pizza, a buy.
See you next time.
I'm as high as hell and you're about to get shot
I spent half my life trying not to be like my father.
-Did you succeed?
-No.
-Screw this!
-What do you expect to find here?
But I found something out after dad died.
I had inherited my fear of becoming like my father.
Did you think I was brain damaged?
It's never too late for an unhappy childhood.
He is cheap, cynical, racist, stupid...
-He has positive sides.
-Name one!
-Would you like a sandwich?
-Sure.
Still waters don't run deep, Liv, they're brackish!
-I might as well talk to the toilet.
-Then do!
I'm talking to you!
-I have every right.
-Drugs!
Don't we have a single glass left?
Don't compare me to you.
You can go to hell!
-You're worse than your father.
-Not a chance.
Do you want to be like him?
I'll never be like him, because he admires you!
You've never done anything for anyone!
I have a visitor, dad.
You are the visitor, Georg.
You are.
Georg!
Gin and tonic in the middle of the day?
-To keep the mosquitos away.
-They're in Africa.
See?
It works!
Hi, is it you?
What?
Are you a lesbian?
Get yourself to a doctor!
-Hi, dad!
Hi, Georg!
-Are you going fishing like that?
-Is it Henrik Ibsen?
-No.
I met a chick.
A chick?
You?
I thought you were a homo!
Get me a shrink!
Say hi to Jenny.
-That's my daughter!
-What?
!
You're all loco.
Jenny!
Dad...
Do I have to go fishing alone?
Yes.
Can't you do anything alone, my little mongo child?
Pussy boy.
Loser.
Dad!
Ow, dad!
Dad, you're killing me!
That isn't a guard dog.
I told you to get a Rottweiler!
NORWEGIAN COZY
-It's about time!
-Right.
-It's been a while.
-Come in.
I'm glad you're here, Mons.
I have the paperwork upstairs.
Actually, Frank, I was...
They know I'm planning to sue.
They want to have me declared insane.
Insane, Mons, insane!
Like Louis ll or Hamsun or Copernicus.
Start taking notes.
You see, Frank, I'm actually here to talk to Georg.
Georg is bought and paid for by the hospital.
They pay him to call me insane.
Start taking notes!
Write this down, Mons.
-Hi.
-Hi there.
I thought he was talking to himself.
Make sure to identify him as a hospital spokesman, not my son.
Frank, I'm serious.
This is a private conversation.
Please leave, so we can talk.
-Does he drink this early?
-I don't think he's been to bed.
This is not good, Georg.
Things are pretty bad these days.
I've been worried about you.
You don't answer the phone.
You haven't submitted anything to the paper in weeks.
Isn't this too much for you, Georg?
Taking care of everything alone?
There are professionals who can deal with this.
Psychiatrists.
You can't do this on your own.
I told you how he was, when we first met after I came back.
I know you did.
And what did you say then?
Have you forgotten?
You regretted breaking all ties with your dad.
You said you became like him by avoiding him.
"He who breaks all ties, loses." Remember that?
Your words.
I doubted you, but it's a little late to state the opposite now.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
But I had no idea...
I think I'll leave.
You know, Mons...
If you had stuck with your father, before he died...
Things wouldn't be as nice as they are inside your head right now.
This place is great!
No reason for it to stand empty.
It's better that you stay here.
It's huge.
There's room for...
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-No.
How is Georg doing?
He doesn't answer his phone.
-You can't reach him either?
-No.
Can't you?
Look at the bathroom.
-Hello?
-Hi, it's Terje.
A dry month.
I'm glad you came.
Bente will be thrilled.
-Are you doing better?
-Yes, slowly but surely.
I don't have a job or any plans or idea of what to do, but...
Mom thinks I'm a druggie, so I thought I'd clear that up.
-What about the pub?
-I quit.
I never considered that the book would be rejected, so I just quit.
-Do you need some money?
-Nah.
That is, I do, but...
It doesn't seem right to ask for that now.
Of course we can lend you some money.
You're her son, Terje.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-How are you doing?
-All right.
I thought I'd drop by and say hi.
That's nice.
Have you heard from your brother?
No.
Me neither.
He won't even pick up the phone.
Do you want something to eat?
Is there anything you need?
Liv said that I could maybe borrow some money.
We have plenty of food in the freezer.
You can just help yourself.
-How much do you need?
-It's for the rent, mom.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Are you happy now?
Did you get him to humiliate himself enough?
-You know what that money is for.
-You know he's not a druggie!
You gave your apartment to a stranger, but when your son needs a loan, you act like some indignant old dyke.
What are you saying?
I encouraged him to ask for money, because I assumed you would behave.
He came here and apologized, in his own way.
Sure, like you know Terje better than me.
-Stop telling me how to be a mother!
-That's irrelevant.
-You know nothing about having kids.
-This is about you!
You're mad because Terje refused to become your obedient little lap dog.
Is that really how you feel?
How long have you felt like that?
-I'm tired of you and your family.
-Then why don't you just leave?
!
Are you planning on leaving me?
The Norwegian mountains are nothing compared to his 1000-km long trek to the North Pole.
Sit!
Good boy.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Is this where there's a room?
-No.
Are you Frank?
No, you're Georg.
Your father said you were moving out.
Excuse me.
Niko!
No, Niko!
I'm sorry.
He just ate your pizza.
Good.
I took this notice from the liquor store.
I'm glad you did.
The thing is, my father is not well.
He has his own perception of reality.
And lately his reality has been far from our reality.
That's exactly what he said about you.
-You don't want to live here.
-I understand.
Is he here?
He insisted I speak directly with him, not with you.
I don't think that's a good idea.
He's pretty confused, so...
I don't think so.
Actually, I think he's sleeping right now.
Sit.
Help!
Dad?
Come help me.
In there.
If you could...
Grab him under there.
One, two...
There we go!
Good.
Still want to move in?
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.
-Don't you know anyone here?
-A bad relationship led me here.
I know people elsewhere.
-Want to borrow money for a hotel?
-No, no.
-Isn't it scary not to have plans?
-No.
Does it scare you?
Yes, it does.
You've never stepped outside, with no plan for the rest of the day?
Or the week?
Or your life?
Nope.
You should try it.
Sometimes it can be wet, cold and nasty.
But once you get in the flow, you can end up in the most wonderful places.
That flow might work for you, but I'd flow straight into the shitter.
I don't think that's for me.
Come with me.
-Into the flow?
-Yeah.
Nah.
-You have to take care of him?
-Right.
Come on, Niko.
But I can give you a call, if I...
If I find something.
Yes, that would be nice.
Come on, boy.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Hi, Georg.
There you are.
You've been hard to reach.
Is something wrong?
-No.
-Because you'd tell me, right?
Hang on, mom.
It's mom, not the hospital.
-Give me the phone.
-I'll call you back, mom.
-It isn't the hospital.
-Let me talk to them.
Do you want to talk to mom?
Here you go.
-Hello?
-It isn't the hospital!
That's it, dad.
I'm moving out.
I've pulled you out of the bathtub twice.
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me!
-You haven't slept in ages.
-I am wide awake.
Take this Valium and go to bed.
Please, dad.
You have to sleep.
Who would I call?
There's no one to call anyway.
Don't you have a life of your own?
-I thought you were in Pakistan.
-I came home.
-Get kicked out?
-No.
I couldn't do anything there.
What did you expect from Quran school?
Sorry.
Tell me about it.
-It sucked!
Can't you see I'm busy?
-Does your dad know you're back?
-No, and you're not telling him.
-But you're robbing him?
-I'm not robbing him.
-It looks like it.
This isn't his money.
Maybe it was before, but not anymore.
-Know that taxi he was going to buy?
-He never will.
With the profits from this place, he could have bought one...in 2050.
The only way to quick money is to win the Lottery, or through these stupid machines.
But he didn't do it because he dreamt of being a cab driver.
He did it to make you proud of him.
He gambled away all his money, so you wouldn't be ashamed of him.
I've never met a man who loves his son more.
All he cares about is you.
And he is devastated because you hate him.
What are you doing?
Don't stop!
This is the best thing that can happen to him.
Rob the people who robbed your dad, and give the money back to him.
Here we go.
Hi.
-So you didn't like it at your dad's?
-I'm just here for my things.
This place looks like hell.
Has that lawyer's fancy habits made you too good for us?
You look like hell.
What do you care?
-Don't you worry about me.
-I'm not.
I'm worried about mom.
She was devastated when you ran away.
You might as well have stabbed her in the heart.
Do you want to hurt your mother that much?
Jenny?
What, are you stealing?
Mom is coming with me.
You may be too good for us, but Solveig stays here.
She lives here!
In order to take care of you?
What is it this time?
Diabetes?
Brittle bones?
M.E.?
You aren't sick!
I don't feel sorry for you!
You never have been sick!
You're nothing but a...
You're a classic first-class psycho!
That's what you are.
A psycho!
You've become such a snob you can't even swear properly.
What makes you think Solveig wants to live with your demented father?
Please don't do this to me, Jenny.
Liv, could I please have a word with you?
-Alone, Torunn.
-Sure you'll be all right?
You may leave.
That woman...
-I used to try to dress like you two.
-I know.
At the end of the day I went home to my family.
-I was the woman we laughed at.
-I've heard it all before.
You don't understand what a phony...
Yes, I do, Bente.
There's nothing you or I can do to change that.
I have a lesson.
When you say people don't change, it makes me want to kill myself.
You can laugh at self-help books because you don't need them.
-But with all my bad decisions...
-I know, Bente!
I know what your life was like.
I realize that it takes time.
I realize you feel guilty about Terje and Georg.
But there isn't any room for me in all that.
I wish there was, but there isn't.
And I don't take much room.
I am lost without you.
I can try to give you more room.
I can change.
I heard the sound of glass breaking.
Probably that door.
-What time was it?
-One, maybe two?
I'm not really sure.
-Everything will be OK.
-Like hell it will.
What if my son comes home?
How will I provide for him?
I wasn't insured.
-Everything will be OK.
-Why are you so positive?
Have a cigarette.
"Once upon a time there was a little boy called Rayad."
"He had such a small penis..." Remember?
-Remember the rest of it?
-No, not really.
I read your book.
It's excellent.
-It wasn't too subjective?
-What, subjective?
-They meant I wrote about myself.
-That's what made it so good.
I've read two novels a week for 30 years.
I know more about literature than you or that shitty publisher of yours.
-A break-in.
-Really?
Can we talk?
-I have said things that I...
-It's OK, mom.
No, it isn't.
-I've just been so angry.
-It's OK.
Don't apologize.
Let's forget about it.
I don't want to be at war with you.
-That's why I came over yesterday.
-I know.
I'm sorry.
Remember how Georg carried you home when you fell off your bike?
It seemed like he carried you every other day.
He knew how to comfort you.
You used to be so close, you and Georg.
Do you know how he is doing?
Is that why you came?
So I can intervene between dad and Georg?
Not at all.
But you've cleared everything up with Frank.
How "cleared up" is it to hide every time he walks by?
It hasn't been easy to avoid him for so long.
But he was always so fond of you.
I didn't want that, mom!
You sent me to talk to him when he was at his worst.
And I was nine!
-Terje, I...
-Stop.
I can't handle your guilt.
Have you talked to Georg?
I tried yesterday, but Frank grabbed the phone.
-Did you talk to him?
-No.
He had that voice again.
You know.
God, I hate him!
If you hate him, he'll own you.
That isn't just an empty phrase.
You think everything is so easy for me.
That if I don't do something it's just because I'm lazy.
I never should have let Georg move in there.
-Hi!
-Hi, come in.
My little girl!
-Thank you.
-Wow!
This place is great!
This will be perfect for you.
Sure is nice of them to let you borrow this place.
They weren't using it anyways.
Did you bring that old thing?
Lovely.
And this too?
Nice.
-And that lamp!
-Yeah, but it doesn't work anymore.
Does this fit you?
A lot of this is mine, Jenny.
-What is this?
-We're going to live here.
-Have you moved me?
-Yeah.
This isn't how it works.
Not now when dad is so sick.
Yes.
Right now!
This is sweet of you, but I am an adult.
You know how grampa gets.
Exactly!
That's why we're staying here.
No, not like this.
Yes.
No.
Yes!
You're staying here with me, mom!
Hello?
No.
No!
No one there?
Probably just a wrong number.
Do you feel better now?
You've slept plenty.
-Dad, it was no one.
-It was Arnt.
-What did he say?
-He's coming to kill us.
Then let's call the police.
He's coming for you, since you started it.
-He said he was going to kill me?
-Yes.
Go down to the basement.
You always said nuclear war was coming, but it never came.
You told me to hide in the sauna in order to survive.
That's a sick way to get your kicks, dad.
I won't give you the pleasure of seeing me scared again.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I didn't think you were home.
I just came for some things.
-Are you hungry?
-No, I'm just...
Can't you stay a little while?
We don't have to talk about it.
Listen, there is one thing...
I don't want you to think that Torunn and I...
-She is a lovely lady.
-No, she isn't.
She's horrible.
A parody.
She's worse than that "felt uterus" lady of yours.
She gave me a CD today.
"Liv, I want you to listen to this with an open mind.
It will help you."
"Deep relaxation." As if I need that!
My God!
I want to know how you and Torunn spend your evenings.
-He instructed us to lie down.
-Stop it!
You've never stepped outside, with no plan for the rest of the day?
Or the week?
Or your life?
Stop it!
Do you live in here?
Do you?
No?
Then get lost!
Get lost!
Beware, beware...
Beware, beware...
-You have reached Georg...
-Shit!
What is this?
He's groping us!
-Did you hide that there?
-Yes.
Better than hiding it in the closet.
We should never have let shame get between us and a good Cabernet.
To a shorter, but much more pleasant life.
Maybe we never should have had a dry month.
-Bente...
-I know.
I know.
Dad?
I'm leaving now.
I'll let the hospital know, so...
I don't think you'll survive here alone.
And you think you'll make it alone out there?
Yes.
Do you hear anything?
No.
Lie down.
Lie down!
Shit, dad!
-Dad, give me that gun.
-Arnt is out there.
No, no one is here.
Please.
-Please give me that gun.
-Lie down!
Put down that gun, OK?
Please.
-Dad, there is no one here.
-Arnt is here.
Lie down, Georg!
-Arnt is out there.
-No one is here!
Arnt isn't here!
Arnt is not outside!
Look!
There is no one out here!
No one!
Lie down.
Arnt is right outside.
Arnt is right outside the window.
Please, dad.
Please.
Solveig?
Have you lost your mind?
I brought your car.
I'll put the keys on the table.
Where are Jenny and Solveig?
-Where are they?
Solveig?
-They aren't here.
Get out.
What have you done, Frank?
-You realize that I am legally insane?
-Where is Jenny?
You mean the bastard girl that showed up here?
Half human, half Sami?
Shut up!
I kicked her out.
Look at yourself, the proud lawyer.
You're nothing but a joke.
Is that some decorative rifle?
You've never touched anything but paper.
You were born a bitch.
Go ahead, shoot me.
You have taken everything...
Shit!
Georg?
Hello?
Where is Georg?
Gone.
Georg is...gone.
And I...
Am a joke.
Did you ever imagine that, Terje?
That I would end up a joke?
I wish you hadn't seen me like this.
You don't look great.
Remember when we went for that walk in the park, you and I?
When we fooled the tourists?
You fooled them.
Said, "The castle burned down yesterday."
You were ten years old.
Spoke fluent English.
That was the best day of my entire life.
You hadn't forgotten about that, had you, Terje?
You hadn't forgotten?
We had a good time together, you and I.
But they ruined it.
Did Georg say where he was going?
Where did he go?
Georg, Georg...
All this nagging about Georg.
He's gone.
Gone!
What have you done, dad?
Huh?
What the hell have you done?
Don't touch him!
Georg...
Were you trying to make him think I was dead?
-Did it amuse you that I was hiding?
-What are you two doing here?
Do you have a phone?
-Where does your cruelty come from?
-Get out of here!
We need an ambulance to 5 Rådyr Street.
It's my father.
He's been assaulted.
It looks like his nose and jaw have been smashed.
And both his arms.
His chin may be smashed too.
I don't know, with a shovel or something.
Good.
Thank you.
I didn't think you had it in you, Georg.
Is this what you have missed, dad?
Is this what I lacked?
I've been better than you my entire life.
Let's go, Terje.
Dear Joakim.
That father-and-son bonding never happened.
We never cried and made up.
Terje was right.
You shouldn't put up with your family at all costs.
But he was also wrong.
This was harder for him than for me.
You can't deal with patricide from a distance.
It cost me nothing to finally make a clean break with dad.
I was ready.
Terje was only ready in theory.
Remember that, Joakim.
If you should ever start hating me.
It doesn't help to run.
Family never leaves you.
Maybe this was necessary, for Terje and me to become brothers again.
It sure has become easier.
Even nice.
Terje has become easier.
Search for:
The West.
Replace with:
Me.
A few minor changes to his book, and it became a bestseller.
"My Demise.
A Comparative Study of Myself and the Roman Empire."
That's quite a mouthful.
I meant to ask you about the protagonist.
-Could it be Western civilization?
-Sure, you could say that.
While I, Joakim, have all the space in the world.
As promised, I called Kajsa.
She lives downstairs now.
That is, she lives both upstairs and down.
She's a flexible lady.
Not really my type at all.
But I could be wrong.
Shit, no more condoms.
Does that matter?
Doesn't it?
OK.
Subtitles:
Nick Norris
I spent half my life trying not to be like my father.
-Did you succeed?
-No.
-Screw this!
-What do you expect to find here?
But I found something out after dad died.
I had inherited my fear of becoming like my father.
Did you think I was brain damaged?
It's never too late for an unhappy childhood.
He is cheap, cynical, racist, stupid...
-He has positive sides.
-Name one!
-Would you like a sandwich?
-Sure.
Still waters don't run deep, Liv, they're brackish!
-I might as well talk to the toilet.
-Then do!
I'm talking to you!
-I have every right.
-Drugs!
Don't we have a single glass left?
Don't compare me to you.
You can go to hell!
-You're worse than your father.
-Not a chance.
Do you want to be like him?
I'll never be like him, because he admires you!
You've never done anything for anyone!
I have a visitor, dad.
You are the visitor, Georg.
You are.
Georg!
Gin and tonic in the middle of the day?
-To keep the mosquitos away.
-They're in Africa.
See?
It works!
Hi, is it you?
What?
Are you a lesbian?
Get yourself to a doctor!
-Hi, dad!
Hi, Georg!
-Are you going fishing like that?
-Is it Henrik Ibsen?
-No.
I met a chick.
A chick?
You?
I thought you were a homo!
Get me a shrink!
Say hi to Jenny.
-That's my daughter!
-What?
!
You're all loco.
Jenny!
Dad...
Do I have to go fishing alone?
Yes.
Can't you do anything alone, my little mongo child?
Pussy boy.
Loser.
Dad!
Ow, dad!
Dad, you're killing me!
That isn't a guard dog.
I told you to get a Rottweiler!
NORWEGIAN COZY
-It's about time!
-Right.
-It's been a while.
-Come in.
I'm glad you're here, Mons.
I have the paperwork upstairs.
Actually, Frank, I was...
They know I'm planning to sue.
They want to have me declared insane.
Insane, Mons, insane!
Like Louis ll or Hamsun or Copernicus.
Start taking notes.
You see, Frank, I'm actually here to talk to Georg.
Georg is bought and paid for by the hospital.
They pay him to call me insane.
Start taking notes!
Write this down, Mons.
-Hi.
-Hi there.
I thought he was talking to himself.
Make sure to identify him as a hospital spokesman, not my son.
Frank, I'm serious.
This is a private conversation.
Please leave, so we can talk.
-Does he drink this early?
-I don't think he's been to bed.
This is not good, Georg.
Things are pretty bad these days.
I've been worried about you.
You don't answer the phone.
You haven't submitted anything to the paper in weeks.
Isn't this too much for you, Georg?
Taking care of everything alone?
There are professionals who can deal with this.
Psychiatrists.
You can't do this on your own.
I told you how he was, when we first met after I came back.
I know you did.
And what did you say then?
Have you forgotten?
You regretted breaking all ties with your dad.
You said you became like him by avoiding him.
"He who breaks all ties, loses." Remember that?
Your words.
I doubted you, but it's a little late to state the opposite now.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
But I had no idea...
I think I'll leave.
You know, Mons...
If you had stuck with your father, before he died...
Things wouldn't be as nice as they are inside your head right now.
This place is great!
No reason for it to stand empty.
It's better that you stay here.
It's huge.
There's room for...
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-No.
How is Georg doing?
He doesn't answer his phone.
-You can't reach him either?
-No.
Can't you?
Look at the bathroom.
-Hello?
-Hi, it's Terje.
A dry month.
I'm glad you came.
Bente will be thrilled.
-Are you doing better?
-Yes, slowly but surely.
I don't have a job or any plans or idea of what to do, but...
Mom thinks I'm a druggie, so I thought I'd clear that up.
-What about the pub?
-I quit.
I never considered that the book would be rejected, so I just quit.
-Do you need some money?
-Nah.
That is, I do, but...
It doesn't seem right to ask for that now.
Of course we can lend you some money.
You're her son, Terje.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-How are you doing?
-All right.
I thought I'd drop by and say hi.
That's nice.
Have you heard from your brother?
No.
Me neither.
He won't even pick up the phone.
Do you want something to eat?
Is there anything you need?
Liv said that I could maybe borrow some money.
We have plenty of food in the freezer.
You can just help yourself.
-How much do you need?
-It's for the rent, mom.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Are you happy now?
Did you get him to humiliate himself enough?
-You know what that money is for.
-You know he's not a druggie!
You gave your apartment to a stranger, but when your son needs a loan, you act like some indignant old dyke.
What are you saying?
I encouraged him to ask for money, because I assumed you would behave.
He came here and apologized, in his own way.
Sure, like you know Terje better than me.
-Stop telling me how to be a mother!
-That's irrelevant.
-You know nothing about having kids.
-This is about you!
You're mad because Terje refused to become your obedient little lap dog.
Is that really how you feel?
How long have you felt like that?
-I'm tired of you and your family.
-Then why don't you just leave?
!
Are you planning on leaving me?
The Norwegian mountains are nothing compared to his 1000-km long trek to the North Pole.
Sit!
Good boy.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Is this where there's a room?
-No.
Are you Frank?
No, you're Georg.
Your father said you were moving out.
Excuse me.
Niko!
No, Niko!
I'm sorry.
He just ate your pizza.
Good.
I took this notice from the liquor store.
I'm glad you did.
The thing is, my father is not well.
He has his own perception of reality.
And lately his reality has been far from our reality.
That's exactly what he said about you.
-You don't want to live here.
-I understand.
Is he here?
He insisted I speak directly with him, not with you.
I don't think that's a good idea.
He's pretty confused, so...
I don't think so.
Actually, I think he's sleeping right now.
Sit.
Help!
Dad?
Come help me.
In there.
If you could...
Grab him under there.
One, two...
There we go!
Good.
Still want to move in?
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.
-Don't you know anyone here?
-A bad relationship led me here.
I know people elsewhere.
-Want to borrow money for a hotel?
-No, no.
-Isn't it scary not to have plans?
-No.
Does it scare you?
Yes, it does.
You've never stepped outside, with no plan for the rest of the day?
Or the week?
Or your life?
Nope.
You should try it.
Sometimes it can be wet, cold and nasty.
But once you get in the flow, you can end up in the most wonderful places.
That flow might work for you, but I'd flow straight into the shitter.
I don't think that's for me.
Come with me.
-Into the flow?
-Yeah.
Nah.
-You have to take care of him?
-Right.
Come on, Niko.
But I can give you a call, if I...
If I find something.
Yes, that would be nice.
Come on, boy.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Hi, Georg.
There you are.
You've been hard to reach.
Is something wrong?
-No.
-Because you'd tell me, right?
Hang on, mom.
It's mom, not the hospital.
-Give me the phone.
-I'll call you back, mom.
-It isn't the hospital.
-Let me talk to them.
Do you want to talk to mom?
Here you go.
-Hello?
-It isn't the hospital!
That's it, dad.
I'm moving out.
I've pulled you out of the bathtub twice.
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me!
-You haven't slept in ages.
-I am wide awake.
Take this Valium and go to bed.
Please, dad.
You have to sleep.
Who would I call?
There's no one to call anyway.
Don't you have a life of your own?
-I thought you were in Pakistan.
-I came home.
-Get kicked out?
-No.
I couldn't do anything there.
What did you expect from Quran school?
Sorry.
Tell me about it.
-It sucked!
Can't you see I'm busy?
-Does your dad know you're back?
-No, and you're not telling him.
-But you're robbing him?
-I'm not robbing him.
-It looks like it.
This isn't his money.
Maybe it was before, but not anymore.
-Know that taxi he was going to buy?
-He never will.
With the profits from this place, he could have bought one...in 2050.
The only way to quick money is to win the Lottery, or through these stupid machines.
But he didn't do it because he dreamt of being a cab driver.
He did it to make you proud of him.
He gambled away all his money, so you wouldn't be ashamed of him.
I've never met a man who loves his son more.
All he cares about is you.
And he is devastated because you hate him.
What are you doing?
Don't stop!
This is the best thing that can happen to him.
Rob the people who robbed your dad, and give the money back to him.
Here we go.
Hi.
-So you didn't like it at your dad's?
-I'm just here for my things.
This place looks like hell.
Has that lawyer's fancy habits made you too good for us?
You look like hell.
What do you care?
-Don't you worry about me.
-I'm not.
I'm worried about mom.
She was devastated when you ran away.
You might as well have stabbed her in the heart.
Do you want to hurt your mother that much?
Jenny?
What, are you stealing?
Mom is coming with me.
You may be too good for us, but Solveig stays here.
She lives here!
In order to take care of you?
What is it this time?
Diabetes?
Brittle bones?
M.E.?
You aren't sick!
I don't feel sorry for you!
You never have been sick!
You're nothing but a...
You're a classic first-class psycho!
That's what you are.
A psycho!
You've become such a snob you can't even swear properly.
What makes you think Solveig wants to live with your demented father?
Please don't do this to me, Jenny.
Liv, could I please have a word with you?
-Alone, Torunn.
-Sure you'll be all right?
You may leave.
That woman...
-I used to try to dress like you two.
-I know.
At the end of the day I went home to my family.
-I was the woman we laughed at.
-I've heard it all before.
You don't understand what a phony...
Yes, I do, Bente.
There's nothing you or I can do to change that.
I have a lesson.
When you say people don't change, it makes me want to kill myself.
You can laugh at self-help books because you don't need them.
-But with all my bad decisions...
-I know, Bente!
I know what your life was like.
I realize that it takes time.
I realize you feel guilty about Terje and Georg.
But there isn't any room for me in all that.
I wish there was, but there isn't.
And I don't take much room.
I am lost without you.
I can try to give you more room.
I can change.
I heard the sound of glass breaking.
Probably that door.
-What time was it?
-One, maybe two?
I'm not really sure.
-Everything will be OK.
-Like hell it will.
What if my son comes home?
How will I provide for him?
I wasn't insured.
-Everything will be OK.
-Why are you so positive?
Have a cigarette.
"Once upon a time there was a little boy called Rayad."
"He had such a small penis..." Remember?
-Remember the rest of it?
-No, not really.
I read your book.
It's excellent.
-It wasn't too subjective?
-What, subjective?
-They meant I wrote about myself.
-That's what made it so good.
I've read two novels a week for 30 years.
I know more about literature than you or that shitty publisher of yours.
-A break-in.
-Really?
Can we talk?
-I have said things that I...
-It's OK, mom.
No, it isn't.
-I've just been so angry.
-It's OK.
Don't apologize.
Let's forget about it.
I don't want to be at war with you.
-That's why I came over yesterday.
-I know.
I'm sorry.
Remember how Georg carried you home when you fell off your bike?
It seemed like he carried you every other day.

No, not like this.
Yes.
No.
Yes!
You're staying here with me, mom!
Hello?

Probably just a wrong number.
Do you feel better now?

Beware, beware...
Beware, beware...
-You have reached Georg...
-Shit!
What is this?
He's groping us!
-Did you hide that there?
-Yes.
Better than hiding it in the closet.
We should never have let shame get between us and a good Cabernet.
To a shorter, but much more pleasant life.
Maybe we never should have had a dry month.
-Bente...
-I know.
I know.
Dad?
I'm leaving now.
I'll let the hospital know, so...
I don't think you'll survive here alone.
And you think you'll make it alone out there?
Yes.
Do you hear anything?
No.
Lie down.
Lie down!
Shit, dad!
-Dad, give me that gun.
-Arnt is out there.
No, no one is here.
Please.
-Please give me that gun.
-Lie down!
Put down that gun, OK?
Please.
-Dad, there is no one here.
-Arnt is here.
Lie down, Georg!
-Arnt is out there.
-No one is here!
Arnt isn't here!
Arnt is not outside!
Look!
There is no one out here!
No one!
Lie down.
Arnt is right outside.
Arnt is right outside the window.
Please, dad.
Please.
Solveig?
Have you lost your mind?
I brought your car.
I'll put the keys on the table.
Where are Jenny and Solveig?
-Where are they?
Solveig?
-They aren't here.
Get out.
What have you done, Frank?
-You realize that I am legally insane?
-Where is Jenny?
You mean the bastard girl that showed up here?
Half human, half Sami?
Shut up!
I kicked her out.
Look at yourself, the proud lawyer.
You're nothing but a joke.
Is that some decorative rifle?
You've never touched anything but paper.
You were born a bitch.
Go ahead, shoot me.
You have taken everything...
Shit!
Georg?
Hello?
Where is Georg?
Gone.
Georg is...gone.
And I...
Am a joke.
Did you ever imagine that, Terje?
That I would end up a joke?
I wish you hadn't seen me like this.
You don't look great.
Remember when we went for that walk in the park, you and I?
When we fooled the tourists?
You fooled them.
Said, "The castle burned down yesterday."
You were ten years old.
Spoke fluent English.
That was the best day of my entire life.
You hadn't forgotten about that, had you, Terje?
You hadn't forgotten?
We had a good time together, you and I.
But they ruined it.
Did Georg say where he was going?
Where did he go?
Georg, Georg...
All this nagging about Georg.
He's gone.
Gone!
What have you done, dad?
Huh?
What the hell have you done?
Don't touch him!
Georg...
Were you trying to make him think I was dead?
-Did it amuse you that I was hiding?
-What are you two doing here?
Do you have a phone?
-Where does your cruelty come from?
-Get out of here!
We need an ambulance to 5 Rådyr Street.
It's my father.
He's been assaulted.
It looks like his nose and jaw have been smashed.
And both his arms.
His chin may be smashed too.
I don't know, with a shovel or something.
Good.
Thank you.
I didn't think you had it in you, Georg.
Is this what you have missed, dad?
Is this what I lacked?
I've been better than you my entire life.
Let's go, Terje.
Dear Joakim.
That father-and-son bonding never happened.
We never cried and made up.
Terje was right.
You shouldn't put up with your family at all costs.
But he was also wrong.
This was harder for him than for me.
You can't deal with patricide from a distance.
It cost me nothing to finally make a clean break with dad.
I was ready.
Terje was only ready in theory.
Remember that, Joakim.
If you should ever start hating me.
It doesn't help to run.
Family never leaves you.
Maybe this was necessary, for Terje and me to become brothers again.
It sure has become easier.
Even nice.
Terje has become easier.
Search for:
The West.
Replace with:
Me.
A few minor changes to his book, and it became a bestseller.
"My Demise.
A Comparative Study of Myself and the Roman Empire."
That's quite a mouthful.
I meant to ask you about the protagonist.
-Could it be Western civilization?
-Sure, you could say that.
While I, Joakim, have all the space in the world.
As promised, I called Kajsa.
She lives downstairs now.
That is, she lives both upstairs and down.
She's a flexible lady.
Not really my type at all.
But I could be wrong.
Shit, no more condoms.
Does that matter?
Doesn't it?
OK.

Good day.
Good day.
I'll cut some for you.
Yes, please.
...and if you're serious about designing buildings in the future, consider everything I've told you in your Bible.
Talent is not everything in this profession.
Reliability is at least as important, if not more so.
Trust.
You must emanate it at all times.
I can't hear you.
Well?
Do you all understand?
How many weeks are there to go?
Two, right?
That means...
Two.
I'm sorry.
What can I do?
I'm in love.
That's all there is to it.
I'm leaving.
It's better for all of us.
Call me if you need anything.
Bye, then.
Good day.
Good day.
Which district?
Damjanich Street, 17 Thank you.
I called her at least five times, but she won't pick up the phone.
Have you tried her mobile and land line?
I tried her at home, on her mobile...
It's switched off.
She drives me crazy.
She's incapable of behaving like an adult.
Will you kiss it goodbye?
Is it sleeping?
It was awake just before.
But now it's sleeping.
Did he take his clothes?
I can't believe this!
What are you doing kid!
Can I help you?
Is one pair enough?
Good day.
What are you doing?
Are you going to clean the whole staircase?
Is your husband home?
The tram doesn't go any further.
You need to get off.
This is the end station.
You need to get off.
Is here something wrong Ma'am?
Give me the scissors!
Come, I'll help you off.
She's in pretty bad shape, no papers on her either.
We can't get a word out of her...
She's not wearing any shoes and she's holding on to a pair of scissors.
Yes.
OK, we'll wait.
Are you working tomorrow?
No.
I think Zoli's on call.
I'll raise two hundred.
Does everybody want some?
Yes.
Yes.
What to do...
Look at your cards and make a decision.
I'm out.
Yes?
Yes, it's me.
Quiet please.
Yes it's me.
When?
Where to exactly?
Thank you.
Yes, I understand.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Is there something wrong?
Any jewelry?
Take off the ring.
Take off the ring.
Use some soap.
It's over there on the sink.
Told you it would do the trick.
Take your barrette out, too.
The barette.
Come.
Time for bed.
Good evening.
Good evening.
I'm looking for János Munk
Is he here?
Yes he is.
I want to talk to him.
What's up?
Haven't you heard?
Heard what?
What happened?
Mom's in the hospital.
Where?
The mental hospital.
The mental hospital?
When did they take her in?
A couple of hours ago.
But is she all right?
They didn't say.
My car's parked in front.
Do you want me to take you up there?
That won't be necessary.
They've sedated her anyway.
She'll only wake up tomorrow.
Aren't you the professional.
No need to play the hero, son.
I won't be fooled by your mother's flare for drama.
OK.
Good night, then.
Wait a minute.
What?
You're blaming me?
Who said I do?
You come over here and make a scene...
You're the one who's making a scene.
Will you go see her tomorrow?
It's better if you go.
Do you have enough money?
Yes I do.
It's time to go to bed now.
What time is it?
Eleven-thirty.
That can't be.
But it is.
Good night.
Ma'am, your change...
Is she sleeping?
Has a doctor seen her yet?
There's no one here.
I brought her pajamas and a robe.
Have you talked to Dad?
Yes.
And you?
Are you OK?
Why does she have to do this when I could go into labor any minute?
I'm going to have to keep her here for at least a week.
She'll rest up and then she can go home.
In a few months she won't remember a thing.
Remember what?
This whole episode.
It could happen to anyone.
You think so?
You should go home now.
She won't wake up until this afternoon.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Zoli only called me to feed the cat this morning.
He said you we're in the hospital.
Have they let you out already?
Do you need the keys?
Are these the ones?
I can't see a thing without my glasses.
Yes.
Yes, Bucharest way.
Bucharest is the nicest town in the world and there are the nicest girls.
Yes this is Balkanian music, the best music in the world, Balkanian music.
Go to your mother, suck, you pig.
Good evening
Passports please
Are you alone?
You are damned beautiful.
I see you like blondes.
Yes that's true.
Where did you get her.
She stopped me at Budapest so I took her.
I believe you, come to the office with the papers.
What I don't understand is how this is possible?
What do you mean you don't know?
There's something I don't understand here.
A patient leaves your ward without anyone's knowledge.
And you have no idea when she left or where she went.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
Morn disappeared from the hospital.
When?
They have no idea.
She has no keys, no papers.
She's wandering around town somewhere.
Call the police immediately.
I'll try Dad first.
Maybe he knows something.
He won't pick up.
Don't worry.
She'll be all right.
But what did she say?
She said they let her out, and that they found nothing wrong with her.
But was she all right?
I mean, did she behave normally?
She was fine.
She smiled, she was nice...
There was nothing the matter with her.
What was she wearing?
That light, polyester dress with the flowers.
Her dressing gown?
Something like that.
But she looked nice.
Did she ask for anything other than the keys?
I mean, did she ask for money or anything like that?
No, just the keys.
I made her some tea but she didn't drink it.
She was in a hurry to leave.
What time was that?
I'm not sure.
Around four, four-thirty.
Sleep.
I don't sleep.
Lay down and sleep.
We have to rest, you lay down here, me too, and we sleep that's it.
Come we have to sleep.
Come.
I don't sleep.
Don't run mother, where do you run?
I wanted to make you happy, look there.
- What does she want?
- If we go to Istanbul.
Yes we go to Istanbul.
If we have a free place in the bus.
Maybe not.
Not enough.
Two of them.
Come with me, I'll show you where to sit.
Please.
Take up, we start.
How do you know she'd been there?
Her dressing gown's there.
She threw it on the bed.
And there's no money in the drawer.
No papers, no credit card, nothing.
It's surreal.
What's surreal is that you're screwing a twenty-year-old student of yours... while my mother's wandering around town, out of her mind.
Did anyone call the police?
Zsófi called then last night.
Listen, son...
I just want you to know that.
I love your mother very much, but...
But what?
But this whole thing is one big scene, which I really don't think we need to take very seriously.
You know what I mean, don't you?
No.
The marriage just wasn't working.
That's all.
We had nothing new to say.
We were bored with each other.
She'd never admit this to herself, of course.
She's known for years.
- Name?
- Mrs. Munk.
Sit down.
- Have you found her?
- Not yet.
- Did you see her?
- I admitted her.
The ambulance brought her in the evening and I gave her something to help her sleep.
I never saw her again.
Are these hers?
Do you have any ID?
Yes.
Give me, please.
Thank you.
Did you see her next morning?
I was on night duty.
I went home at six in the morning.
Look, I gave her a shot around midnight.
She fell asleep.
They say she slipped out.
Sign here please.
Will you let me know when you find her?
If we find her.
Goodbye.
Is something wrong?
Take deep breaths.
Hold it back, please!
Calm down.
So the last bit of information you have is that your wife went into the apartment...
And in all probability took some money with her.
Yes.
I went to the apartment today.
I'm sure she was there, but she didn't leave any message.
Her papers and cash are gone, She probably took them with her.
Does she have a cell phone?
Yes, but she never uses it.
She left it on the nightstand.
I find that a little odd.
There's nothing odd about it.
She doesn't like it.
Wouldn't she take it if she left the country?
But why would she leave the country?
That I don't know, but what I do know is that... your wife crossed the border at Nagylak at 11:35 last night.
Where'd you get that information?
My computer.
That's the border crossing into Romania, isn't it?
Yes.
A car crossing.
But she doesn't drive.
She crossed with a valid passport as a passenger in a Romanian truck.
What's she doing in Romania?
I was hoping you'd tell me.
Can I smoke here?
Dad?
He's not here.
They called him down to the police station.
When?
He should be back soon.
Do you want to wait here?
Do you want anything?
No, thanks.
Do you have sex with him?
No.
But don't worry.
I do give him blowjobs.
OK.
Sorry.
- Hi.
- I understand.
Your son's here.
Do you want to talk to him?
Didn't want to talk to me?
He went to your sister in the hospital.
Is my sister in the hospital too?
She's giving birth.
Didn't you know?
Bye.
Can I have your number?
The little girl is fine, but we're still working on her mother.
Is she all right?
Not really.
Will she survive?
Al this point I would say she will.
What happened?
It's a girl.
- Istanbul?
- How did she get there?
I have no idea.
The police called me this morning.
They tracked her to a motel in Istanbul.
She checked in yesterday.
But what's she doing there?
They don't know, all they know is that she checked in yesterday with her passport.
Like any other tourist.
It's crazy.
Why don't they bring her home?
They can't, she hasn't done anything wrong.
They don't have the authority.
She bought a visa at the border, she's completely legal.
Someone has to go get her.
Why?
She might be having a great time.
She can finally get some rest.
How can you say that?
She's ill!
Oh, so now she's ill.
But when you should've gone to see her... in the hospital she was fine.
Just making a scene, right?
What would she be doing in Istanbul, If she were ill?
Riding in a Romanian truck.
And you think that's normal?
You want her to sit in the empty apartment and wait for you, is that it?
I think you're the one who's ill.
If you go get her I'll pay for everything.
You leave tomorrow morning and bring her home the day after.
You're kidding, right?
I'm afraid something will happen to her.
- Well then?
- Nothing.
Then why did we meet?
Why not?
Please don't...
- Are you laughing at me?
- I'm laughing at myself.
Who is it?
Juli.
Are you going to let me in?
Come up.
When are you leaving?
Early.
You want me to take you to the airport?
I'll call a cab.
I kicked your father out.
It's none of my business.
Why did you come here?
Relax, we'll get there in time.
What time is it?
We have 15 minutes.
Will you call?
- Maybe.
- Right.
Are you alright?
It's me!
Let me in!
Mom!
Call me if you need anything.
- Are we going to the airport together tomorrow?
- Of course.
Call you later.
Wait up!
Who was that man?
Where do you know him from?
What's his name?
Is it good?
It's great.
I'm not hungry.
We're going home in the morning.
I have the plane tickets.
Home.
To Budapest.
Do you understand?
We have to pack.
We have to be at the airport by eight.
Everyone is waiting for you, the whole family.
And your newborn grandchild.
We're afraid something might happen to you.
You want to be with that guy?
You don't even know him.
If you want to say goodbye to him, fine.
I'll take a walk on the beach, or something.
Go ahead, say goodbye.
What do I care!
Hi.
Hi.
- She's sleeping?
- Thank God!
Hi.
Where is she?
Mom stayed.
- What do you mean, stayed.
- In Istanbul.
You're joking, right?
I think she looks like me.
Would you pay attention for a minute son?
Don't worry.
She's alright.
She's coming home next week.
She's on vacation in the country with a friend.
Did you come by car?
I find it hard to understand how you could leave your sick mother in a foreign country all alone.
I bought a plane ticket and everything.
Your job was to bring her home.
Maybe you should have gone instead.
I wouldn't have left her there, That's for sure!
I wouldn't have left a sick person in Asia, All by herself, completely vulnerable.
She's not sick.
How do you know, who's sick and who's not?
What are you, a doctor?
Previously on "The Nine Lives of Chloe King"...
That feeling I got when I first saw him in the church, it was like I was experiencing exactly what he was feeling.
This is the longest we've spent together since mom died.
What's that supposed to mean?
Dad, most fathers would be thrilled that their son actually wanted to spend time with them.
I like you a lot and I like being a around you.
If you need time, I'm in no hurry.
Something tells me we're going to be very good friends.
Alek!
Your mom, she's the leader of the Mai?
I'm sorry, Chloe, but your life is no longer your own.
Hey!
Wait up.
You're doing great.
Though I don't think an assassin would let you take a time out to catch your breath, at least none of the assassins I know.
And that's why we're training.
But you can't keep stopping to look for obstacles.
Assume they're going to be there and improvise.
Assume invisible obstacles.
Got it.
The Order won't tell you where the knives are gonna land.
That's why you're such a good teacher-- always bringing it back to a practical application.
Think she's ready?
- Ready for what?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna say yes, but there's only one way to find out.
Wait!
How come my opinion doesn't count for anything?
- And I'm thinking not.
- Chloe, you can do this.
I promise.
Back up and try again.
Stop acting like a little scaredy human.
But what if I am a little scaredy human?
No, you're Mai.
So stop thinking and start using your instinct.
I am, and my instincts are telling me that you people are crazy.
If Alek can do it, then I'm pretty sure you can.
Hey.
Fine.
It generally hurts less if you actually jump all the way across.
You didn't trust yourself.
Next time you might not be so lucky.
Not gonna be a next time.
Come on, we got a lot more work to do.

Morning.
Made your favorite-- cereal and bowl.
Some assembly required.
Oh excellent.
I was actually craving...
Unfrosted corn byproducts?
I thought I was supposed to enjoy my youth.
What happened to that box of sugary deliciousness?
Down your mother's gullet at 11:00 last night.
You're not the only one with cravings.
I think I'm gonna be late tonight.
It's okay.
It's Wednesday.
Ah, dinner with the dos amigos, yeah.
You going to Amy's this week?
I think burgers is the plan.
Already jealous.
Oh and, Chloe, what exactly were you doing last night?
I found your jeans on the bathroom floor with a huge hole in 'em.
Uh, you know me.
Wild child-- slinking down alleys, running across rooftops.
I tripped over the recycling bin coming in the side.
How many times have I told you that area-- the "are you okay?" Is implied as is the "I love you."
- Always is.
And I'm fine.
- Have a good day.
Ugh.
- For sure!
- You have to promise.
You can't tell anyone.
Devon's parents were out of town last night and we totally--
- Really?
- Sure did.
Yes, it's infected.
Yes, it hurt.
And yes, my mom's gonna kill me if she ever sees it.
Coach says a 4.9 won't even get college scouts interested.
Turn around.
Having fun?
I swear, I'm gonna tie a bell around your neck.
Stop sneaking up on me.
Maybe you would have heard if you weren't preoccupied.
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going to class.
And tuning into all the gossip?
So where do you think that tattoo actually is?
At least I think it's a tattoo she's talking about.
Ew!
And I wouldn't know.
It's just noise.
I can't really control it.
We'll have to work on that.
The hearing is there to alert you to danger.
- Meaning you?
- Meaning killers, executioners.
the assorted non-human predator.
You're not safe just because you stopped one man.
You have to learn to control your gifts.
It might mean between life and-- well, for you, losing another.
Is this your long-winded, slightly frightening way of saying that I have training again tonight?
- Jasmine will pick you up after work.
- Can't wait.
Has anyone ever told you that you're a close talker?
- Just you.
- It's not a compliment.
I'll see you later.
Oh and, Chloe, be careful.
One of these days something you won't like.
That's the third night in a row she's blown me off.
I seriously think I might be in the market for a new best friend.
- Hey, you.
- Hey.
You look industrious.
And before you think I'm getting all stalkery, this sidewalk happens between school and work-- you know, if I take the long way around the park and cut across Divisadero.
Oh yeah, no, you didn't have to do that.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Just in the middle of working on some stuff.
Getting my self organized.
Organized is good.
Um, I texted you last night about that movie.
Blood, guts, flying limbs-
- I'm in.
I think I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
My dad-- let's just say he's being my dad-- and that's complex.
Rain checks happily accepted.
Well, I'd better go or I'm gonna be late.
And as of two minutes ago, I actually am late.
- See ya.
- See ya.
Mr. Rezza, a moment of your time.
- My employer is very upset.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
The Order does not exist to serve your personal vendettas.
Perhaps if you had listened when I tried to warn you...
The Mai now know of the girl's existence.
Plans were in place, but now she's guarded and protected.
Your involvement is no longer required.
We will dispose of the girl.
Expecting a call?
More like hoping for one.
I told Brian that we could only be friends.
And I thought he was okay with it, but-- you were being sarcastic.
Glad you caught that.
Hey, my friend Jasmine's coming by a little before 6:00 and I was wondering--
If you could stay to the end of your shift for a change?
It's like you're a mind reader.
Vintage.
Lana.
Look, hold on one second.
- Paul.
- Hey.
You're coming tonight, right?
It's my turn to pick.
Of course.
I would never miss dinner with my two best friends.
So is everything okay, you know, between you and me?
Paul?
Okay, to be honest, I have been a little hurt.
While I understand there's an unfortunate recurring borderline racist narrative in the American comic book pantheon of Asians being portrayed as subservient geeks or simply one-dimensional kung-fu-kicking bad-asses,
- I am none of those things.
- What are you talking about?
Why haven't you asked me to be your sidekick?
- My what?
- Your sidekick.
Your sidekick, your loyal and trusted confidant.
You, my friend, are already all of those things.
- Really?
- Really.
Unless I ever see you in tights.
Then the deal's off.
This conversation's over.
Chloe!
Whoops.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
For a second I just--
I felt completely terrified.
- She's not that scary.
- No.
It's like I was feeling what she was feeling.
She's the one who's terrified.
I know, I know...
Uh, whatever that weird sense thing is you got going on You might wanna get it adjusted.
But I don't even know what it is.
So you're saying you can read people's minds?
No, I can't tell what they're thinking.
I literally feel what they're feeling on an emotional level.
But I can't control it.
It just happens.
See, this is the part where you say, "Oh yeah, I get that all the time.
It's a Mai thing.
It's so not a big deal."
Sorry, I've never heard of anything like it.
Great, so my powers came with an extra scoop of freak.
That Chloe, always an overachiever.
Chloe, I really don't think it's anything to worry about.
But if it'll make you feel better, we can talk to my mom.
Hey, either of you "Lana Jacobs"?
No, sorry.
She left about a half an hour ago.
I guess that's why the instructions say to be here by 4:00.
Do you need me to sign for something?
I wish you could, but they're cupcakes, and these things go stale pretty quick.
And there is a God.
They included her home address.
411 Arden.
She moved, like, two weeks ago.
I'll write it down for you.
Thanks, I really appreciate that.
I think she could use a little cheering up.
Here you go.
All right.
Have a good one.
- What the hell?
- Chloe!
What's the matter with you?
I have no idea.
It's like I was possessed.
I mean the second he touched me.
I just felt this huge, giant wave of rage.
I just-
- I don't know how else to describe it.
That must have been so frightening.
For me and him.
I mean, he just kind of took off.
I wanted to go after him, but Jasmine--
Was right to bring you to me.
At this moment he's the least of your problems.
Something's wrong with me, Valentina.
Really wrong.
I think if Jasmine hadn't been there,
I-
- I might have tried to kill him.
And perhaps you would have.
So it's imperative that you learn to control this.
How am I supposed to control this when I don't even know what this is?
Valentina?
Do you know what the word "empathy" means?
Yeah, it's like if your friend feels bad, then you feel bad for them.
Close.
Empathy is directly experiencing the emotions of another person.
You, my child, are an empath.
Like being Mai and the Uniter wasn't enough?
Or more likely you have this gift because you are the Uniter.
Some of the very old legends claim that all Mai were once capable of this.
It's what bonded us to humans.
It's not surprising that you possess this quality.
You are the embodiment of all that is Mai.
So if I tried with you right now--
No, it was something that passed only between Mai and humans.
But it doesn't even work right.
I thought Lana was terrified and she was laughing.
And the delivery guy was maybe kind of annoyed, but he certainly wasn't out to kill anybody.
I know that you don't want to hear this, but perhaps you should limit your contact with humans.
What am I gonna do?
Ignore my family and friends?
I'm not saying forever.
Just until we have a better understanding.
Ugh, my friends!
Do you know what time it is?
- Chloe.
- I've gotta go.
Enough bad things have happened today without adding one more to the list.
Go.
Oh!
Supersized sorry.
Mm-hmm.
So I guess cats can't read clocks.
Amy, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Did Jasmine tell you what's going on with the mind melding?
You already ate?
Yeah, that's usually what we do when we go out to dinner.
- Please don't be this way.
- And which way is that?
Is it possible to get back to the crazy superpower
- portion of our evening?
- No.
Look, I know I've been a little flaky lately, but you didn't really mean it when you said you might be in the market for a new best friend, did you?
Who told you that?
I can't believe you told her that.
No, it wasn't Paul.
I just heard it.
I'm sorry.
This hearing thing isn't quite under control yet.
What else have you been listening to?
Have you ever heard of invasion of privacy?
Amy, you're missing the point.
No, I get it.
And A:
Obviously I didn't really mean it.
And B:
Now I think I just might.
The Chloe I know would never do something like that or treat her friends this way.
I gotta go.
I told the dads I wouldn't be late.
Some sidekick.
She's my ride.
Hey, kiddo.
Sorry I'm late.
Crazy day.
How was dinner?
- I didn't actually make it.
- Really?
I thought Wednesdays were practically sacred.
Are you gonna get on my case now too?
No, I am too tired to get on anyone's case.
Sorry.
I just feel like...
Do you ever have one of those days where you feel a little out of control?
Frequently.
- Wanna talk?
- Amy's pissed.
Angry.
Amy's mad at me for reasons only known to Amy.
Well, she's not used to waiting in line.
You've been spending all that time with your new friends.
And now you sound like her.
But it's not like she and Paul haven't been surgically joined at the hip.
Maybe you're just going through a little adjustment period.
I mean, as people grow up, sometimes-- do not finish that sentence.
She's my best friend.
Then I'm not quite sure what we're talking about.
You don't understand.
No, it doesn't seem like I do.
- Anything else bothering you?
- No.
Why?
It's just a sense.
But since you don't seem to be in the mood for spilling secrets or seeking motherly wisdom,
I'm gonna close up shop and go to bed.
But if you change your mind,
I will be open again in the morning.
- 'Night.
- 'Night.
Look, I know I asked for help, but this is like 600 radio stations playing at once.
I'll never be able to do it.
- Pick something.
- I can't.
- Just do what I tell you.
- Highly suspicious.
Don't be.
Now close your eyes.
It's so loud.
Hello?
Ignore it.
Listen to your breathing-- the air going in and out of your body.
Take your time.
The rest of the world doesn't matter.
There's only you and me.
Can you hear the clock?
Top of the tower.
- Alek.
- You can do this.
I can hear it.
There's a woman in the market haggling with a vendor.
All right, how about we do two for $50?
Now make it all go away.
You are in charge of the world around you.
- I don't know.
- Listen to my heartbeat.
Just that... and nothing else.
Did it work?
Yeah, it um-- it worked.
Thanks.
- Hey.
Is Chloe around?
- Not yet.
Thought she was always here in the afternoon.
You and me both.
Well, could you just tell her that--
Poised and ready.
Never mind.
I'll just give her a call.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I had to stay late for this class thing.
Your guy just left two seconds ago.
- Brian?
- Chloe.
You and I need to talk.
What happened here yesterday?
- You heard about that?
- I heard about it and somehow he thinks I'm the one who put you up to it.
The delivery guy?
- Why would he think that?
- What delivery guy?
How many guys did you knock over in here?
- I'm talking about Jesse.
- You know him?
Wish I didn't, but yeah.
He's my ex.
I'm sorry.
He never said he knew you, and he had your wrong address, so I--
Wait.
You're the one who gave him my new address?
I was trying to help.
He's the reason I moved out in the first place.
I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
- Chloe, this is so screwed up.
He's never gonna leave me alone now.
He's the reason you're so scared, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
This is none of your business.
But I'm right, aren't I?
Seriously, I'm warning you.
Let it go.
Lana, you have to do something.
I can help.
You know what would help?
If you just grabbed your stuff and you got out.
- I'm being serious.
- So am I.
Chloe, you're fired.
It didn't actually make sense until that moment.
You seem almost excited you got fired.
No, don't you get it?
It means I was right.
What I felt about Lana was right.
It's still very weird, but it's not completely wrong.
Has to make you feel better.
Bo staff...
Nunchucks, iodine-- I think we're good to go.
Shouldn't I have something to fight with?
No.
Tonight's lesson:
Avoidance.
Sometimes the best way to take a blow is to not be there when it lands.
Okay, crazy teenage ninja girl, don't you ever get tired of hitting me with things?
All the time, but my mom tasked me with training you.
Hmm, what if I work "avoidance" into a sentence and act like I took a bamboo pole to the head the next time I see her?
Then can we skip?
And what do you wanna do instead?
Spoons are in the top drawer.
So Jesse must have called Lana that afternoon when I got that feeling off her.
That's why she was so upset.
And if he's going around town pretending to be a delivery guy to get her address-- total nutjob, right?
Mm-hmm.
- Mm.
- Mm, so good.
Hey, you said that the Mai are always watching me, you know, to make sure I'm safe.
Could I get a couple of them to watch Lana instead?
Chloe, Lana can take care of herself.
I'm more worried--
What?
I don't think my mom's been completely honest with you.
It wasn't just that one scarface creep.
The Order's back.
They're here in San Francisco.
They're here for you.
I just get worried.
And I appreciate it.
I know this isn't the life you were expecting.
It's not all bad.
Is it bad if I have a little bit of each?
Not at all.
And I had to guess at what you might like.
You so didn't have to do this.
I know, but I wanted to apologize for being kind of rude the other day.
You weren't rude.
My head was just kind of somewhere else.
- Believe me, it's okay.
- No no, it's not.
We had that whole conversation about being friends, and which I'm fine with.
The truth is I actually don't have any friends here, which means that I don't really have anyone to talk to.
You can talk to me.
I know.
This is-- this is the reason I came home.
What's it to?
I think a safety deposit box, but I haven't been able to figure out where yet.
My mom supposedly was killed... in a mugging that went bad, but parts of it just never made sense to me.
I felt like my dad was never telling me the whole story.
But where'd you get the key?
It showed up at school about a month ago with a note on it--
"Do you really know what happened to your mother?"
At first I thought it was some sick joke, but then I realized I'm not really sure.
So now I'm here and I'm gonna stay until I figure it out.
I'm glad you told me.
Me too.
Feels good talking about it.
It's been bothering me for years.
I guess I kind of felt like I just had to do something about it.
I know the feeling.
Lana!
Lana, are you okay?
- What are you doing here?
- Did you tell them about Jesse?
Why would I do that?
Lana, come on, he had to have done this.
I really just want him to go away.
- You have to tell the police.
- Tell them what?
That I think some guy who can't quite grasp the concept of "I never wanna see you again" broke in here?
Why, to teach me a lesson?
He may be a major-league jerk with some serious control issues,
- but he's not violent.
- What do you call this?
I don't know.
My boss is gonna kill me.
I was just hoping if I ignore him...
This is already embarrassing enough.
Please, let me deal with this on my own.
- Lana.
- I'm a big girl, Chloe.
I can handle myself.
What's going on?
Is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
- Lana...
- Her ex-boyfriend's terrorizing her.
I'm almost sure he's the one who broke into the store.
So you were totally right.
Was there ever any question?
I just have to figure out what to do.
Maybe you should call Alek and Jasmine.
I'm sure they can help you make it all better.
Amy, look, I'm sorry if--
No, I'm not gonna say it, 'cause I'm pretty much done apologizing.
You said that the Chloe you know would never do this or act this way.
Well, newsflash:
I'm not the same old Chloe.
We can pretend that I am, but we all know it's not true.
You've always been my best friend.
And if it's up to me, you always will be.
But you have to accept me as I am now, faults, claws and all.
If you can't, I get it.
Not happy, but I get it.
And the next time you get jealous of the time I spend with Alek and Jasmine, try and remember that I'm only doing it so I don't have to die again.
Hello again.
You know the police are, like, 2' away.
Call them.
I'd love to tell them how you assaulted me the other night
- for absolutely no reason.
- Stay away from her.
What happens between me and Lana is none of your business.
But if you don't back off,
I'll make sure that you're my business.
Don't be an idiot.
If he ever comes within 10' of you again, I will personally rip out his lungs.
How about you just keep him away from Lana?
Chloe, I know you've already been warned.
This isn't your fight.
You've gotta get your priorities straight.
I can't just walk away.
There's nothing else you can do.
Now please just go home.
- But Lana--
- You heard her.
She can take care of herself.
Stop watching me.
You know I can't do that.
Oh my God.
Chloe, why didn't you tell me all of this was going on?
I don't think I was completely sure until now.
Well, now that you know, you are gonna stay far far away from this whole situation.
- But, mom--
- No, I don't think you understand how dangerous a guy like this can be.
If Lana doesn't call the police, I will.
But what if that makes it worse?
Doing nothing seldom makes problems go away.
This is what's been bothering you, isn't it?
What?
I knew something was up with you.
I just-
- I didn't know what it was.
How did you know?
Face it, kid, we're bonded.
You feel bad or sad, I feel bad or sad, even if I don't know the reason.
I can't even help it.
I think that means you're empathic.
No, that means I'm your mother.
You know, you don't have to go through all this stuff alone.
We, you and me, are a team.
Thanks.
Go, team us.
Do you think Lana's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
I hope so.
And I know you wanna help, but right now it's up to Lana.
You've let her know you're there.
But it's her life.
She has to take control of it.
I don't know if it's always that easy.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Nothing.
Just hanging out, hoping to catch a glimpse of the old man.
I noticed mom's picture isn't out anymore.
Well, sometimes it's best not to live in the past.
It was hard seeing her smiling face staring up at me every day like nothing bad had ever happened.
I keep the one of the three of us-- that summer on the boat.
I keep that next to my bed.
It was a good trip.
Maybe we can do it again.
Finally catch that marlin.
It'd be good to get away together one of these days.
I'm glad you're home.
Thanks.
Me too.
Hey, Lana, me again.
The fifth message, but I'm worried.
So just call me, please?
Amy?
Before you say anything, you were right and I was wrong.
I was the one being a bad friend.
I was afraid of losing you.
- Amy--
- I was completely self-involved.
I wasn't even trying to see things from your point of view.
- Amy!
- What?
I need you.
Can you come over?
I'm outside in my car waiting for you to forgive me, dummy.
You're the one who said you wanted to go fast to make sure we're not being followed.
I'm pretty sure we lost them.
Look, Amy, I know it's not the best time, but I am deeply-- and we can deeply make up and forgive each other after you make sure Lana's okay.
I just wanna check on her.
If you see him coming-- you're number one on my speed dial.
Now go.
I didn't tell you you could come here.
You don't have to tell me anything.
I can do what I want, and I want to talk to you.
I'm done talking about this.
Let's go.
I'm not going anywhere.
Lana!
Lana!
I told you to stay out of this.
I told you to stay away from her.
I can see why Lana broke up with you.
Not only are you a sarcastic jerk, but you're kind of slow.
- Rawr!
- Uh!
Aw, see, normally I'd apologize, but I decided to stop doing that today.
It's time somebody taught you some manners.
Well, you sure as hell are not the one to do it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
You?
So much better.
Thank you.
I suppose this means I have to give you your job back.
That's supposed to be my job.
I should have been there, not her.
- No offense.
- None taken.
Well, there's only one problem.
- What's that?
- You don't have a car.
Hey.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Just been here waiting for you.
Don't we have some training to do?
And make sure you don't leave out any of the important stuff.
Chloe has to know how to protect herself.
That's what we've been trying--
He doesn't have a car.
Let's go.
I'll call you later.
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
He's very handsome.
Looks a lot like you.
You shouldn't leave guns lying around the house.
Very dangerous.
I just wanted you to know that if the girl is so much as touched... that I know where to find you and your son.
Get out of my house.
Remember, whether we see each other again is entirely up to you.

I hear you've been taking some unnecessary risks.
I knew I could make that jump.
I meant this afternoon with your friend.
That could have ended very differently.
- It was important to me.
- I understand.
Your human friends are important to you.
And I'd do it again.
You keep telling me to follow my instincts.
That's what I did.
I might not always understand them, but I have to learn to trust them.
I know I might not be the kind of Uniter you were hoping for, but this is the one you've got.
You're exactly the kind that we were hoping for.
Maybe it's time Mai and humans stopped living in different worlds.
It's not gonna be easy, Chloe.
So much hope and so much fear all in one girl.
Like it or not, the whole world is coming for you.
Then let it come.

Previously on "The Nine lives of Chloe King"...
Chloe:
That feeling I got when I first saw him in the church, it was like I was experiencing exactly what he was feeling.
This is the longest we've spent together since mom died.
What's that supposed to mean?
Dad, most fathers would be thrilled that their son actually wanted to spend time with them.
I like you a lot and I like being a around you.
If you need time, I'm in no hurry.
Something tells me we're going to be very good friends.
Alek!
Your mom, she's the leader of the Mai?
I'm sorry, Chloe, but your life is no longer your own.
( Panting )
Hey!
Wait up.
You're doing great.
Though I don't think an assassin would let you take a time out to catch your breath, at least none of the assassins I know.
And that's why we're training.
But you can't keep stopping to look for obstacles.
Assume they're going to be there and improvise.
Assume invisible obstacles.
Got it.
The Order won't tell you where the knives are gonna land.
That's why you're such a good teacher-- always bringing it back to a practical application.
Think she's ready?
- Ready for what?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna say yes, but there's only one way to find out.
Wait!
How come my opinion doesn't count for anything?
- And I'm thinking not.
- Chloe, you can do this.
I promise.
Back up and try again.
Stop acting like a little scaredy human.
But what if I am a little scaredy human?
No, you're Mai.
So stop thinking and start using your instinct.
I am, and my instincts are telling me that you people are crazy.
If Alek can do it, then I'm pretty sure you can.
Hey.
( Sighs ) Fine.
( Grunting )
It generally hurts less if you actually jump all the way across.
You didn't trust yourself.
Next time you might not be so lucky.
Not gonna be a next time.
Come on, we got a lot more work to do.

Morning.
Made your favorite-- cereal and bowl.
Some assembly required.
Oh excellent.
I was actually craving...
Unfrosted corn byproducts?
I thought I was supposed to enjoy my youth.
What happened to that box of sugary deliciousness?
Down your mother's gullet at 11:00 last night.
You're not the only one with cravings.
I think I'm gonna be late tonight.
It's okay.
It's Wednesday.
Ah, dinner with the dos amigos, yeah.
You going to Amy's this week?
I think burgers is the plan.
Already jealous.
Oh and, Chloe, what exactly were you doing last night?
( coughs )
I found your jeans on the bathroom floor with a huge hole in 'em.
Uh, you know me.
Wild child-- slinking down alleys, running across rooftops.
I tripped over the recycling bin coming in the side.
How many times have I told you that area-- the "are you okay?" Is implied as is the "I love you."
- Always is.
And I'm fine.
- Have a good day.
Ugh.
( Students laughing )
- (Girl) For sure!
- You have to promise.
You can't tell anyone.
Devon's parents were and we totally-- night,
- (girl #2) Really?
- (Girl #3) Sure did.
Yes, it's infected.
Yes, it hurt.
And yes, my mom's gonna kill me if she ever sees it.
Coach says a 4.9 won't even get college scouts interested.
Turn around.
Having fun?
I swear, I'm gonna tie a bell around your neck.
Stop sneaking up on me.
Maybe you would have heard if you weren't preoccupied.
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going to class.
And tuning into all the gossip?
So where do you think that tattoo actually is?
At least I think it's a tattoo she's talking about.
Ew!
And I wouldn't know.
It's just noise.
I can't really control it.
We'll have to work on that.
The hearing is there to alert you to danger.
- Meaning you?
- Meaning killers, executioners.
the assorted non-human predator.
You're not safe just because you stopped one man.
You have to learn to control your gifts.
It might mean between life and-- well, for you, losing another.
Is this your long-winded, slightly frightening way of saying that I have training again tonight?
- Jasmine will pick you up after work.
- Can't wait.
Has anyone ever told you that you're a close talker?
- Just you.
- It's not a compliment.
I'll see you later.
Oh and, Chloe, be careful.
One of these days something you won't like.
That's the third night in a row she's blown me off.
I seriously think I might be in the market for a new best friend.
- Hey, you.
- Hey.
You look industrious.
And before you think I'm getting all stalkery, this sidewalk happens between school and work-- you know, if I take the long way around the park and cut across Divisadero.
Oh yeah, no, you didn't have to do that.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Just in the middle of working on some stuff.
Organized is good.
Um, I texted you last night about that movie.
Blood, guts, flying limbs-
- I'm in.
I think I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
My dad-- let's just say he's being my dad-- and that's complex.
Rain checks happily accepted.
Well, I'd better go or I'm gonna be late.
And as of two minutes ago, I actually am late.
- See ya.
- See ya.
( Sighs )
Mr. Rezza, a moment of your time.
- My employer is very upset.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
The Order does not exist to serve your personal vendettas.
Perhaps if you had listened when I tried to warn you...
The Mai now know of the girl's existence.
Plans were in place, but now she's guarded and protected.
Your involvement is no longer required.
We will dispose of the girl.
Expecting a call?
More like hoping for one.
I told Brian that we could only be friends.
And I thought he was okay with it, but-- you were being sarcastic.
Glad you caught that.
Hey, my friend Jasmine's coming by a little before 6:00 and I was wondering--
If you could stay to the end of your shift for a change?
It's like you're a mind reader.
- ( Phone ringing )
- Vintage.
Lana.
Look, hold on one second.
- Paul.
- Hey.
You're coming tonight, right?
It's my turn to pick.
Of course.
I would never miss dinner with my two best friends.
So is everything okay, you know, between you and me?
Paul?
Okay, to be honest, I have been a little hurt.
While I understand there's an unfortunate recurring borderline racist narrative in the American comic book pantheon of Asians being portrayed as subservient geeks or simply one-dimensional kung-fu-kicking bad-asses,
- I am none of those things.
- What are you talking about?
Why haven't you asked me to be your sidekick?
- My what?
- Your sidekick.
Your sidekick, your loyal and trusted confidant.
You, my friend, are already all of those things.
- Really?
- Really.
Unless I ever see you in tights.
Then the deal's off.
- ( Laughs )
- This conversation's over.
( Beep )
- Chloe!
Whoops.
- ( Gasps )
- What's wrong?
I don't know.
For a second I just--
I felt completely terrified.
- She's not that scary.
- No.
It's like I was feeling what she was feeling.
She's the one who's terrified.
Lana:
I know, I know...
Uh, whatever that weird sense thing is you got going on...
- ( Laughing ) ...You might wanna get it adjusted.
But I don't even know what it is.
So you're saying you can read people's minds?
No, I can't tell what they're thinking.
I literally feel what they're feeling on an emotional level.
But I can't control it.
It just happens.
See, this is the part where you say, "Oh yeah, I get that all the time.
It's a Mai thing.
It's so not a big deal."
Sorry, I've never heard of anything like it.
Great, so my powers came with an extra scoop of freak.
That Chloe, always an overachiever.
Chloe, I really don't think it's anything to worry about.
But if it'll make you feel better, we can talk to my mom.
( Bell jingles )
Hey, either of you "Lana Jacobs"?
No, sorry.
She left about a half an hour ago.
I guess that's why the instructions say to be here by 4:00.
Do you need me to sign for something?
I wish you could, but they're cupcakes, and these things go stale pretty quick.
And there is a God.
They included her home address.
411 Arden.
She moved, like, two weeks ago.
I'll write it down for you.
Thanks, I really appreciate that.
I think she could use a little cheering up.
Here you go.
All right.
Have a good one.
- ( Chloe gasps ) - ( Grunts )
- What the hell?
- Chloe!
What's the matter with you?
I have no idea.
It's like I was possessed.
I mean the second he touched me.
I just felt this huge, giant wave of rage.
I just-
- I don't know how else to describe it.
That must have been so frightening.
For me and him.
I mean, he just kind of took off.
I wanted to go after him, but Jasmine--
Was right to bring you to me.
At this moment he's the least of your problems.
Something's wrong with me, Valentina.
Really wrong.
I think if Jasmine hadn't been there,
I-
- I might have tried to kill him.
And perhaps you would have.
So it's imperative that you learn to control this.
How am I supposed to control this when I don't even know what this is?
Valentina?
Do you know what the word "empathy" means?
Yeah, it's like if your friend feels bad, then you feel bad for them.
Close.
Empathy is directly experiencing the emotions of another person.
You, my child, are an empath.
Like being Mai and the Uniter wasn't enough?
Or more likely you have this gift because you are the Uniter.
Some of the very old legends claim that all Mai were once capable of this.
It's what bonded us to humans.
It's not surprising that you possess this quality.
You are the embodiment of all that is Mai.
So if I tried with you right now--
No, it was something that passed only between Mai and humans.
But it doesn't even work right.
I thought Lana was terrified and she was laughing.
And the delivery guy was maybe kind of annoyed, but he certainly wasn't out to kill anybody.
I know that you don't want to hear this, but perhaps you should limit your contact with humans.
What am I gonna do?
Ignore my family and friends?
I'm not saying forever.
Just until we have a better understanding.
( Gasps ) Ugh, my friends!
Do you know what time it is?
- Chloe.
- I've gotta go.
Enough bad things have happened today without adding one more to the list.
Go.
Oh!
Supersized sorry.
Mm-hmm.
So I guess cats can't read clocks.
Amy, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Did Jasmine tell you what's going on with the mind melding?
You already ate?
Yeah, that's usually what we do when we go out to dinner.
- Please don't be this way.
- And which way is that?
Is it possible to get back to the crazy superpower
- portion of our evening?
- (Chloe and Amy) No.
Look, I know I've been a little flaky lately, but you didn't really mean it when you said you might be in the market for a new best friend, did you?
Who told you that?
I can't believe you told her that.
No, it wasn't Paul.
I just heard it.
I'm sorry.
This hearing thing isn't quite under control yet.
What else have you been listening to?
Have you ever heard of invasion of privacy?
Amy, you're missing the point.
No, I get it.
And A:
Obviously I didn't really mean it.
And B:
Now I think I just might.
The Chloe I know would never do something like that or treat her friends this way.
I gotta go.
I told the dads I wouldn't be late.
Some sidekick.
She's my ride.
Meredith:
Hey, kiddo.
Sorry I'm late.
Crazy day.
How was dinner?
- I didn't actually make it.
- Really?
I thought Wednesdays were practically sacred.
Are you gonna get on my case now too?
No, I am too tired to get on anyone's case.
Sorry.
I just feel like...
( Sighs )
Do you ever have one of those days where you feel a little out of control?
Frequently.
- Wanna talk?
- Amy's pissed.
Angry.
Amy's mad at me for reasons only known to Amy.
Well, she's not used to waiting in line.
You've been spending all that time with your new friends.
And now you sound like her.
But it's not like she and Paul haven't been surgically joined at the hip.
Maybe you're just going through a little adjustment period.
I mean, as people grow up, sometimes-- do not finish that sentence.
She's my best friend.
Then I'm not quite sure what we're talking about.
You don't understand.
No, it doesn't seem like I do.
- Anything else bothering you?
- No.
Why?
It's just a sense.
But since you don't seem to be in the mood for spilling secrets or seeking motherly wisdom,
I'm gonna close up shop and go to bed.
But if you change your mind,
I will be open again in the morning.
- 'Night.
- 'Night.
( Sighs )
Look, I know I asked for help, but this is like 600 radio stations playing at once.
I'll never be able to do it.
- Pick something.
- I can't.
- Just do what I tell you.
- Highly suspicious.
Don't be.
Now close your eyes.
( Siren wailing ) ( Baby crying )
( Squeaking )
It's so loud.
- ( Cell phone ringing )
- Hello?
Alek:
Ignore it.
Listen to your breathing-- the air going in and out of your body.
Take your time.
The rest of the world doesn't matter.
There's only you and me.
( Exhales )
Can you hear the clock?
Top of the tower.
- Alek.
- You can do this.
( Faint ticking )
- I can hear it.
( Ticking louder )
There's a woman in the market haggling with a vendor.
All right, how about we do two for $50?
Alek:
Now make it all go away.
You are in charge of the world around you.
- I don't know.
- Listen to my heartbeat.
Just that... and nothing else.
( Heart beating, background noise fades )
Did it work?
Yeah, it um-- it worked.
Thanks.
- Hey.
Is Chloe around?
- Not yet.
Thought she was always here in the afternoon.
You and me both.
Well, could you just tell her that--
Poised and ready.
Never mind.
I'll just give her a call.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I had to stay late for this class thing.
Your guy just left two seconds ago.
- Brian?
- Chloe.
You and I need to talk.
What happened here yesterday?
- You heard about that?
- I heard about it and somehow he thinks I'm the one who put you up to it.
The delivery guy?
- Why would he think that?
- What delivery guy?
How many guys did you knock over in here?
- I'm talking about Jesse.
- You know him?
Wish I didn't, but yeah.
He's my ex.
I'm sorry.
He never said he knew you, and he had your wrong address, so I--
Wait.
You're the one who gave him my new address?
I was trying to help.
He's the reason I moved out in the first place.
I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
- Chloe, this is so screwed up.
He's never gonna leave me alone now.
He's the reason you're so scared, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
This is none of your business.
But I'm right, aren't I?
Seriously, I'm warning you.
Let it go.
Lana, you have to do something.
I can help.
You know what would help?
If you just grabbed your stuff and you got out.
- I'm being serious.
- So am I.
Chloe, you're fired.
It didn't actually make sense until that moment.
You seem almost excited you got fired.
No, don't you get it?
It means I was right.
What I felt about Lana was right.
It's still very weird, but it's not completely wrong.
Has to make you feel better.
Bo staff...
Nunchucks, iodine-- I think we're good to go.
Shouldn't I have something to fight with?
No.
Tonight's lesson:
Avoidance.
Sometimes the best way to take a blow is to not be there when it lands.
Okay, crazy teenage ninja girl, don't you ever get tired of hitting me with things?
All the time, but my mom tasked me with training you.
Hmm, what if I work "avoidance" into a sentence and act like I took a bamboo pole to the head the next time I see her?
Then can we skip?
And what do you wanna do instead?
Spoons are in the top drawer.
So Jesse must have called Lana that afternoon when I got that feeling off her.
That's why she was so upset.
And if he's going around town pretending to be a delivery guy to get her address-- total nutjob, right?
Mm-hmm.
- Mm.
- Mm, so good.
Hey, you said that the Mai are always watching me, you know, to make sure I'm safe.
Could I get a couple of them to watch Lana instead?
Chloe, Lana can take care of herself.
I'm more worried--
What?
I don't think my mom's been completely honest with you.
It wasn't just that one scarface creep.
The Order's back.
They're here in San Francisco.
They're here for you.
I just get worried.
And I appreciate it.
I know this isn't the life you were expecting.
( Cell phone chiming )
It's not all bad.
Is it bad if I have a little bit of each?
Not at all.
And I had to guess at what you might like.
You so didn't have to do this.
I know, but I wanted to apologize for being kind of rude the other day.
You weren't rude.
My head was just kind of somewhere else.
- Believe me, it's okay.
- No no, it's not.
We had that whole conversation about being friends, and which I'm fine with.
The truth is I actually don't have any friends here, which means that I don't really have anyone to talk to.
You can talk to me.
I know.
This is-- this is the reason I came home.
What's it to?
I think a safety deposit box, but I haven't been able to figure out where yet.
My mom supposedly was killed... in a mugging that went bad, but parts of it just never made sense to me.
I felt like my dad was never telling me the whole story.
But where'd you get the key?
It showed up at school about a month ago with a note on it--
"Do you really know what happened to your mother?"
At first I thought it was some sick joke, but then I realized I'm not really sure.
So now I'm here and I'm gonna stay until I figure it out.
I'm glad you told me.
Me too.
Feels good talking about it.
It's been bothering me for years.
I guess I kind of felt like I just had to do something about it.
I know the feeling.
( Siren chirping )
Lana!
Lana, are you okay?
- What are you doing here?
- Did you tell them about Jesse?
Why would I do that?
Lana, come on, he had to have done this.
I really just want him to go away.
- You have to tell the police.
- Tell them what?
That I think some guy who can't quite grasp the concept of "I never wanna see you again" broke in here?
Why, to teach me a lesson?
He may be a major-league jerk with some serious control issues,
- but he's not violent.
- What do you call this?
I don't know.
My boss is gonna kill me.
I was just hoping if I ignore him...
This is already embarrassing enough.
Please, let me deal with this on my own.
- Lana.
- I'm a big girl, Chloe.
I can handle myself.
What's going on?
Is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
- Lana...
- Her ex-boyfriend's terrorizing her.
I'm almost sure he's the one who broke into the store.
So you were totally right.
Was there ever any question?
I just have to figure out what to do.
Maybe you should call Alek and Jasmine.
I'm sure they can help you make it all better.
Amy, look, I'm sorry if--
No, I'm not gonna say it, 'cause I'm pretty much done apologizing.
You said that the Chloe you know would never do this or act this way.
Well, newsflash:
I'm not the same old Chloe.
We can pretend that I am, but we all know it's not true.
You've always been my best friend.
And if it's up to me, you always will be.
But you have to accept me as I am now, faults, claws and all.
If you can't, I get it.
Not happy, but I get it.
And the next time you get jealous of the time I spend with Alek and Jasmine, try and remember that I'm only doing it so I don't have to die again.
Hello again.
You know the police are, like, 2' away.
Call them.
I'd love to tell them how you assaulted me the other night
- for absolutely no reason.
- Stay away from her.
What happens between me and Lana is none of your business.
But if you don't back off,
I'll make sure that you're my business.
Don't be an idiot.
If he ever comes within 10' of you again, I will personally rip out his lungs.
How about you just keep him away from Lana?
Chloe, I know you've already been warned.
This isn't your fight.
You've gotta get your priorities straight.
I can't just walk away.
There's nothing else you can do.
Now please just go home.
- But Lana--
- You heard her.
She can take care of herself.
Stop watching me.
You know I can't do that.
Meredith:
Oh my God.
Chloe, why didn't you tell me all of this was going on?
I don't think I was completely sure until now.
Well, now that you know, you are gonna stay far far away from this whole situation.
- But, mom--
- No, I don't think you understand how dangerous a guy like this can be.
If Lana doesn't call the police, I will.
But what if that makes it worse?
Doing nothing seldom makes problems go away.
This is what's been bothering you, isn't it?
What?
I knew something was up with you.
I just-
- I didn't know what it was.
How did you know?
Face it, kid, we're bonded.
You feel bad or sad, I feel bad or sad, even if I don't know the reason.
I can't even help it.
I think that means you're empathic.
No, that means I'm your mother.
You know, you don't have to go through all this stuff alone.
We, you and me, are a team.
Thanks.
Go, team us.
Do you think Lana's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
I hope so.
And I know you wanna help, but right now it's up to Lana.
You've let her know you're there.
But it's her life.
She has to take control of it.
I don't know if it's always that easy.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Nothing.
Just hanging out, hoping to catch a glimpse of the old man.
I noticed mom's picture isn't out anymore.
Well, sometimes it's best not to live in the past.
It was hard seeing her smiling face staring up at me every day like nothing bad had ever happened.
I keep the one of the three of us-- that summer on the boat.
I keep that next to my bed.
It was a good trip.
Maybe we can do it again.
Finally catch that marlin.
It'd be good to get away together one of these days.
I'm glad you're home.
Thanks.
Me too.
( Phone rings )
Hey, Lana, me again.
The fifth message, but I'm worried.
So just call me, please?
- ( Phone chimes, beeps )
- Amy?
Before you say anything, you were right and I was wrong.
I was the one being a bad friend.
I was afraid of losing you.
- Amy--
- I was completely self-involved.
I wasn't even trying to see things from your point of view.
- Amy!
- What?
I need you.
Can you come over?
I'm outside in my car waiting for you to forgive me, dummy.
( Beeps )
( Tires screech )
You're the one who said you wanted to go fast to make sure we're not being followed.
I'm pretty sure we lost them.
Look, Amy, I know it's not the best time, but I am deeply-- and we can deeply make up and forgive each other after you make sure Lana's okay.
I just wanna check on her.
If you see him coming-- you're number one on my speed dial.
Now go.
( Glass shatters )
Lana:
I didn't tell you you could come here.
Jesse:
You don't have to tell me anything.
I can do what I want, and I want to talk to you.
I'm done talking about this.
Let's go.
- (Jesse) I'm not going anywhere.
( Glass shatters )
Lana!
Lana!
( Gasps )
I told you to stay out of this.
I told you to stay away from her.
I can see why Lana broke up with you.
Not only are you a sarcastic jerk, but you're kind of slow.
- Rawr!
- Uh!
Aw, see, normally I'd apologize, but I decided to stop doing that today.
It's time somebody taught you some manners.
Well, you sure as hell are not the one to do it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
You?
So much better.
Thank you.
I suppose this means I have to give you your job back.
That's supposed to be my job.
I should have been there, not her.
- No offense.
- None taken.
Well, there's only one problem.
- What's that?
- You don't have a car.
( Girls laughing )
Hey.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Just been here waiting for you.
Don't we have some training to do?
Amy:
And make sure you don't leave out any of the important stuff.
Chloe has to know how to protect herself.
Alek:
That's what we've been trying--
He doesn't have a car.
Let's go.
I'll call you later.
( Beeps )
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
He's very handsome.
Looks a lot like you.
You shouldn't leave guns lying around the house.
Very dangerous.
I just wanted you to know that if the girl is so much as touched... that I know where to find you and your son.
Get out of my house.
Remember, whether we see each other again is entirely up to you.

I hear you've been taking some unnecessary risks.
I knew I could make that jump.
I meant this afternoon with your friend.
That could have ended very differently.
- It was important to me.
- I understand.
Your human friends are important to you.
And I'd do it again.
You keep telling me to follow my instincts.
That's what I did.
I might not always understand them, but I have to learn to trust them.
I know I might not be the kind of Uniter you were hoping for, but this is the one you've got.
You're exactly the kind that we were hoping for.
Maybe it's time Mai and humans stopped living in different worlds.
It's not gonna be easy, Chloe.
So much hope and so much fear all in one girl.
Like it or not, the whole world is coming for you.
Then let it come.

Previously on "The Nine Lives of Chloe King"...
Chloe:
That feeling I got when I first saw him in the church, it was like I was experiencing exactly what he was feeling.
This is the longest we've spent together since mom died.
What's that supposed to mean?
Dad, most fathers would be thrilled that their son actually wanted to spend time with them.
I like you a lot and I like being a around you.
If you need time, I'm in no hurry.
Something tells me we're going to be very good friends.
Alek!
Your mom, she's the leader of the Mai?
I'm sorry, Chloe, but your life is no longer your own.
( Panting )
Hey!
Wait up.
You're doing great.
Though I don't think an assassin would let you take a time out to catch your breath, at least none of the assassins I know.
And that's why we're training.
But you can't keep stopping to look for obstacles.
Assume they're going to be there and improvise.
Assume invisible obstacles.
Got it.
The Order won't tell you where the knives are gonna land.
That's why you're such a good teacher-- always bringing it back to a practical application.
Think she's ready?
- Ready for what?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna say yes, but there's only one way to find out.
Wait!
How come my opinion doesn't count for anything?
- And I'm thinking not.
- Chloe, you can do this.
I promise.
Back up and try again.
Stop acting like a little scaredy human.
But what if I am a little scaredy human?
No, you're Mai.
So stop thinking and start using your instinct.
I am, and my instincts are telling me that you people are crazy.
If Alek can do it, then I'm pretty sure you can.
Hey.
( Sighs ) Fine.
( Grunting )
It generally hurts less if you actually jump all the way across.
You didn't trust yourself.
Next time you might not be so lucky.
Not gonna be a next time.
Come on, we got a lot more work to do.

Morning.
Made your favorite-- cereal and bowl.
Some assembly required.
Oh excellent.
I was actually craving...
Unfrosted corn byproducts?
I thought I was supposed to enjoy my youth.
What happened to that box of sugary deliciousness?
Down your mother's gullet at 11:00 last night.
You're not the only one with cravings.
I think I'm gonna be late tonight.
It's okay.
It's Wednesday.
Ah, dinner with the dos amigos, yeah.
You going to Amy's this week?
I think burgers is the plan.
Already jealous.
Oh and, Chloe, what exactly were you doing last night?
( coughs )
I found your jeans on the bathroom floor with a huge hole in 'em.
Uh, you know me.
Wild child-- slinking down alleys, running across rooftops.
I tripped over the recycling bin coming in the side.
How many times have I told you that area-- the "are you okay?" Is implied as is the "I love you."
- Always is.
And I'm fine.
- Have a good day.
Ugh.
( Students laughing )
- (Girl) For sure!
- You have to promise.
You can't tell anyone.
Devon's parents were out of town last night and we totally- (girl #2) Really?
- (Girl #3) Sure did.
Yes, it's infected.
Yes, it hurt.
And yes, my mom's gonna kill me if she ever sees it.
Coach says a 4.9 won't even get college scouts interested.
Turn around.
Having fun?
I swear, I'm gonna tie a bell around your neck.
Stop sneaking up on me.
Maybe you would have heard if you weren't preoccupied.
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going to class.
And tuning into all the gossip?
So where do you think that tattoo actually is?
At least I think it's a tattoo she's talking about.
Ew!
And I wouldn't know.
It's just noise.
I can't really control it.
We'll have to work on that.
The hearing is there to alert you to danger.
- Meaning you?
- Meaning killers, executioners.
the assorted non-human predator.
You're not safe just because you stopped one man.
You have to learn to control your gifts.
It might mean between life and-- well, for you, losing another.
Is this your long-winded, slightly frightening way of saying that I have training again tonight?
- Jasmine will pick you up after work.
- Can't wait.
Has anyone ever told you that you're a close talker?
- Just you.
- It's not a compliment.
I'll see you later.
Oh and, Chloe, be careful.
One of these days something you won't like.
That's the third night in a row she's blown me off.
I seriously think I might be in the market for a new best friend.
- Hey, you.
- Hey.
You look industrious.
And before you think I'm getting all stalkery, this sidewalk happens between school and work-- you know, if I take the long way around the park and cut across Divisadero.
Oh yeah, no, you didn't have to do that.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Just in the middle of working on some stuff.
Getting my self organized.
Organized is good.
Um, I texted you last night about that movie.
Blood, guts, flying limbs-
- I'm in.
I think I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
My dad-- let's just say he's being my dad-- and that's complex.
Rain checks happily accepted.
Well, I'd better go or I'm gonna be late.
And as of two minutes ago, I actually am late.
- See ya.
- See ya.
( Sighs )
Mr. Rezza, a moment of your time.
- My employer is very upset.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
The Order does not exist to serve your personal vendettas.
Perhaps if you had listened when I tried to warn you...
The Mai now know of the girl's existence.
Plans were in place, but now she's guarded and protected.
Your involvement is no longer required.
We will dispose of the girl.
Expecting a call?
More like hoping for one.
I told Brian that we could only be friends.
And I thought he was okay with it, but-- you were being sarcastic.
Glad you caught that.
Hey, my friend Jasmine's coming by a little before 6:00 and I was wondering--
If you could stay to the end of your shift for a change?
It's like you're a mind reader.
- ( Phone ringing )
- Vintage.
Lana.
Look, hold on one second.
- Paul.
- Hey.
You're coming tonight, right?
It's my turn to pick.
Of course.
I would never miss dinner with my two best friends.
So is everything okay, you know, between you and me?
Paul?
Okay, to be honest, I have been a little hurt.
While I understand there's an unfortunate recurring borderline racist narrative in the American comic book pantheon of Asians being portrayed as subservient geeks or simply one-dimensional kung-fu-kicking bad-asses,
- I am none of those things.
- What are you talking about?
Why haven't you asked me to be your sidekick?
- My what?
- Your sidekick.
Your sidekick, your loyal and trusted confidant.
You, my friend, are already all of those things.
- Really?
- Really.
Unless I ever see you in tights.
Then the deal's off.
- ( Laughs )
- This conversation's over.
( Beep )
- Chloe!
Whoops.
- ( Gasps )
- What's wrong?
I don't know.
For a second I just--
I felt completely terrified.
- She's not that scary.
- No.
It's like I was feeling what she was feeling.
She's the one who's terrified.
Lana:
I know, I know...
Uh, whatever that weird sense thing is you got going on...
- ( Laughing ) ...You might wanna get it adjusted.
But I don't even know what it is.
So you're saying you can read people's minds?
No, I can't tell what they're thinking.
I literally feel what they're feeling on an emotional level.
But I can't control it.
It just happens.
See, this is the part where you say, "Oh yeah, I get that all the time.
It's a Mai thing.
It's so not a big deal."
Sorry, I've never heard of anything like it.
Great, so my powers came with an extra scoop of freak.
That Chloe, always an overachiever.
Chloe, I really don't think it's anything to worry about.
But if it'll make you feel better, we can talk to my mom.
( Bell jingles )
Hey, either of you "Lana Jacobs"?
No, sorry.
She left about a half an hour ago.
I guess that's why the instructions say to be here by 4:00.
Do you need me to sign for something?
I wish you could, but they're cupcakes, and these things go stale pretty quick.
And there is a God.
They included her home address.
411 Arden.
She moved, like, two weeks ago.
I'll write it down for you.
Thanks, I really appreciate that.
I think she could use a little cheering up.
Here you go.
All right.
Have a good one.
- ( Chloe gasps ) - ( Grunts )
- What the hell?
- Chloe!
What's the matter with you?
I have no idea.
It's like I was possessed.
I mean the second he touched me.
I just felt this huge, giant wave of rage.
I just-
- I don't know how else to describe it.
That must have been so frightening.
For me and him.
I mean, he just kind of took off.
I wanted to go after him, but Jasmine--
Was right to bring you to me.
At this moment he's the least of your problems.
Something's wrong with me, Valentina.
Really wrong.
I think if Jasmine hadn't been there,
I-
- I might have tried to kill him.
And perhaps you would have.
So it's imperative that you learn to control this.
How am I supposed to control this when I don't even know what this is?
Valentina?
Do you know what the word "empathy" means?
Yeah, it's like if your friend feels bad, then you feel bad for them.
Close.
Empathy is directly experiencing the emotions of another person.
You, my child, are an empath.
Like being Mai and the Uniter wasn't enough?
Or more likely you have this gift because you are the Uniter.
Some of the very old legends claim that all Mai were once capable of this.
It's what bonded us to humans.
It's not surprising that you possess this quality.
You are the embodiment of all that is Mai.
So if I tried with you right now--
No, it was something that passed only between Mai and humans.
But it doesn't even work right.
I thought Lana was terrified and she was laughing.
And the delivery guy was maybe kind of annoyed, but he certainly wasn't out to kill anybody.
I know that you don't want to hear this, but perhaps you should limit your contact with humans.
What am I gonna do?
Ignore my family and friends?
I'm not saying forever.
Just until we have a better understanding.
( Gasps ) Ugh, my friends!
Do you know what time it is?
- Chloe.
- I've gotta go.
Enough bad things have happened today without adding one more to the list.
Go.
Oh!
Supersized sorry.
Mm-hmm.
So I guess cats can't read clocks.
Amy, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Did Jasmine tell you what's going on with the mind melding?
You already ate?
Yeah, that's usually what we do when we go out to dinner.
- Please don't be this way.
- And which way is that?
Is it possible to get back to the crazy superpower
- portion of our evening?
- (Chloe and Amy) No.
Look, I know I've been a little flaky lately, but you didn't really mean it when you said you might be in the market for a new best friend, did you?
Who told you that?
I can't believe you told her that.
No, it wasn't Paul.
I just heard it.
I'm sorry.
This hearing thing isn't quite under control yet.
What else have you been listening to?
Have you ever heard of invasion of privacy?
Amy, you're missing the point.
No, I get it.
And A:
Obviously I didn't really mean it.
And B:
Now I think I just might.
The Chloe I know would never do something like that or treat her friends this way.
I gotta go.
I told the dads I wouldn't be late.
Some sidekick.
She's my ride.
Meredith:
Hey, kiddo.
Sorry I'm late.
Crazy day.
How was dinner?
- I didn't actually make it.
- Really?
I thought Wednesdays were practically sacred.
Are you gonna get on my case now too?
No, I am too tired to get on anyone's case.
Sorry.
I just feel like...
( Sighs )
Do you ever have one of those days where you feel a little out of control?
Frequently.
- Wanna talk?
- Amy's pissed.
Angry.
Amy's mad at me for reasons only known to Amy.
Well, she's not used to waiting in line.
You've been spending all that time with your new friends.
And now you sound like her.
But it's not like she and Paul haven't been surgically joined at the hip.
Maybe you're just going through a little adjustment period.
I mean, as people grow up, sometimes-- do not finish that sentence.
She's my best friend.
Then I'm not quite sure what we're talking about.
You don't understand.
No, it doesn't seem like I do.
- Anything else bothering you?
- No.
Why?
It's just a sense.
But since you don't seem to be in the mood for spilling secrets or seeking motherly wisdom,
I'm gonna close up shop and go to bed.
But if you change your mind,
I will be open again in the morning.
- 'Night.
- 'Night.
( Sighs )
Look, I know I asked for help, but this is like 600 radio stations playing at once.
I'll never be able to do it.
- Pick something.
- I can't.
- Just do what I tell you.
- Highly suspicious.
Don't be.
Now close your eyes.
( Siren wailing ) ( Baby crying )
( Squeaking )
It's so loud.
- ( Cell phone ringing )
- Hello?
Alek:
Ignore it.
Listen to your breathing-- the air going in and out of your body.
Take your time.
The rest of the world doesn't matter.
There's only you and me.
( Exhales )
Can you hear the clock?
Top of the tower.
- Alek.
- You can do this.
( Faint ticking )
- I can hear it.
( Ticking louder )
There's a woman in the market haggling with a vendor.
All right, how about we do two for $50?
Alek:
Now make it all go away.
You are in charge of the world around you.
- I don't know.
- Listen to my heartbeat.
Just that... and nothing else.
( Heart beating, background noise fades )
Did it work?
Yeah, it um-- it worked.
Thanks.
- Hey.
Is Chloe around?
- Not yet.
Thought she was always here in the afternoon.
You and me both.
Well, could you just tell her that--
Poised and ready.
Never mind.
I'll just give her a call.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I had to stay late for this class thing.
Your guy just left two seconds ago.
- Brian?
- Chloe.
You and I need to talk.
What happened here yesterday?
- You heard about that?
- I heard about it and somehow he thinks I'm the one who put you up to it.
The delivery guy?
- Why would he think that?
- What delivery guy?
How many guys did you knock over in here?
- I'm talking about Jesse.
- You know him?
Wish I didn't, but yeah.
He's my ex.
I'm sorry.
He never said he knew you, and he had your wrong address, so I--
Wait.
You're the one who gave him my new address?
I was trying to help.
He's the reason I moved out in the first place.
I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
- Chloe, this is so screwed up.
He's never gonna leave me alone now.
He's the reason you're so scared, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
This is none of your business.
But I'm right, aren't I?
Seriously, I'm warning you.
Let it go.
Lana, you have to do something.
I can help.
You know what would help?
If you just grabbed your stuff and you got out.
- I'm being serious.
- So am I.
Chloe, you're fired.
It didn't actually make sense until that moment.
You seem almost excited you got fired.
No, don't you get it?
It means I was right.
What I felt about Lana was right.
It's still very weird, but it's not completely wrong.
Has to make you feel better.
Bo staff...
Nunchucks, iodine-- I think we're good to go.
Shouldn't I have something to fight with?
No.
Tonight's lesson:
Avoidance.
Sometimes the best way to take a blow is to not be there when it lands.
Okay, crazy teenage ninja girl, don't you ever get tired of hitting me with things?
All the time, but my mom tasked me with training you.
Hmm, what if I work "avoidance" into a sentence and act like I took a bamboo pole to the head the next time I see her?
Then can we skip?
And what do you wanna do instead?
Spoons are in the top drawer.
So Jesse must have called Lana that afternoon when I got that feeling off her.
That's why she was so upset.
And if he's going around town pretending to be a delivery guy to get her address-- total nutjob, right?
Mm-hmm.
- Mm.
- Mm, so good.
Hey, you said that the Mai are always watching me, you know, to make sure I'm safe.
Could I get a couple of them to watch Lana instead?
Chloe, Lana can take care of herself.
I'm more worried--
What?
I don't think my mom's been completely honest with you.
It wasn't just that one scarface creep.
The Order's back.
They're here in San Francisco.
They're here for you.
I just get worried.
And I appreciate it.
I know this isn't the life you were expecting.
( Cell phone chiming )
It's not all bad.
Is it bad if I have a little bit of each?
Not at all.
And I had to guess at what you might like.
You so didn't have to do this.
I know, but I wanted to apologize for being kind of rude the other day.
You weren't rude.
My head was just kind of somewhere else.
- Believe me, it's okay.
- No no, it's not.
We had that whole conversation about being friends, and which I'm fine with.
The truth is I actually don't have any friends here, which means that I don't really have anyone to talk to.
You can talk to me.
I know.
This is-- this is the reason I came home.
What's it to?
I think a safety deposit box, but I haven't been able to figure out where yet.
My mom supposedly was killed... in a mugging that went bad, but parts of it just never made sense to me.
I felt like my dad was never telling me the whole story.
But where'd you get the key?
It showed up at school about a month ago with a note on it--
"Do you really know what happened to your mother?"
At first I thought it was some sick joke, but then I realized I'm not really sure.
So now I'm here and I'm gonna stay until I figure it out.
I'm glad you told me.
Me too.
Feels good talking about it.
It's been bothering me for years.
I guess I kind of felt like I just had to do something about it.
I know the feeling.
( Siren chirping )
Lana!
Lana, are you okay?
- What are you doing here?
- Did you tell them about Jesse?
Why would I do that?
Lana, come on, he had to have done this.
I really just want him to go away.
- You have to tell the police.
- Tell them what?
That I think some guy who can't quite grasp the concept of "I never wanna see you again" broke in here?
Why, to teach me a lesson?
He may be a major-league jerk with some serious control issues,
- but he's not violent.
- What do you call this?
I don't know.
My boss is gonna kill me.
I was just hoping if I ignore him...
This is already embarrassing enough.
Please, let me deal with this on my own.
- Lana.
- I'm a big girl, Chloe.
I can handle myself.
What's going on?
Is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
- Lana...
- Her ex-boyfriend's terrorizing her.
I'm almost sure he's the one who broke into the store.
So you were totally right.
Was there ever any question?
I just have to figure out what to do.
Maybe you should call Alek and Jasmine.
I'm sure they can help you make it all better.
Amy, look, I'm sorry if--
No, I'm not gonna say it, 'cause I'm pretty much done apologizing.
You said that the Chloe you know would never do this or act this way.
Well, newsflash:
I'm not the same old Chloe.
We can pretend that I am, but we all know it's not true.
You've always been my best friend.
And if it's up to me, you always will be.
But you have to accept me as I am now, faults, claws and all.
If you can't, I get it.
Not happy, but I get it.
And the next time you get jealous of the time I spend with Alek and Jasmine, try and remember that I'm only doing it so I don't have to die again.
Hello again.
You know the police are, like, 2' away.
Call them.
I'd love to tell them how you assaulted me the other night
- for absolutely no reason.
- Stay away from her.
What happens between me and Lana is none of your business.
But if you don't back off,
I'll make sure that you're my business.
Don't be an idiot.
If he ever comes within 10' of you again, I will personally rip out his lungs.
How about you just keep him away from Lana?
Chloe, I know you've already been warned.
This isn't your fight.
You've gotta get your priorities straight.
I can't just walk away.
There's nothing else you can do.
Now please just go home.
- But Lana--
- You heard her.
She can take care of herself.
Stop watching me.
You know I can't do that.
Meredith:
Oh my God.
Chloe, why didn't you tell me all of this was going on?
I don't think I was completely sure until now.
Well, now that you know, you are gonna stay far far away from this whole situation.
- But, mom--
- No, I don't think you understand how dangerous a guy like this can be.
If Lana doesn't call the police, I will.
But what if that makes it worse?
Doing nothing seldom makes problems go away.
This is what's been bothering you, isn't it?
What?
I knew something was up with you.
I just-
- I didn't know what it was.
How did you know?
Face it, kid, we're bonded.
You feel bad or sad, I feel bad or sad, even if I don't know the reason.
I can't even help it.
I think that means you're empathic.
No, that means I'm your mother.
You know, you don't have to go through all this stuff alone.
We, you and me, are a team.
Thanks.
Go, team us.
Do you think Lana's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
I hope so.
And I know you wanna help, but right now it's up to Lana.
You've let her know you're there.
But it's her life.
She has to take control of it.
I don't know if it's always that easy.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Nothing.
Just hanging out, hoping to catch a glimpse of the old man.
I noticed mom's picture isn't out anymore.
Well, sometimes it's best not to live in the past.
It was hard seeing her smiling face staring up at me every day like nothing bad had ever happened.
I keep the one of the three of us-- that summer on the boat.
I keep that next to my bed.
It was a good trip.
Maybe we can do it again.
Finally catch that marlin.
It'd be good to get away together one of these days.
I'm glad you're home.
Thanks.
Me too.
( Phone rings )
Hey, Lana, me again.
The fifth message, but I'm worried.
So just call me, please?
- ( Phone chimes, beeps )
- Amy?
Before you say anything, you were right and I was wrong.
I was the one being a bad friend.
I was afraid of losing you.
- Amy--
- I was completely self-involved.
I wasn't even trying to see things from your point of view.
- Amy!
- What?
I need you.
Can you come over?
I'm outside in my car waiting for you to forgive me, dummy.
( Beeps )
( Tires screech )
You're the one who said you wanted to go fast to make sure we're not being followed.
I'm pretty sure we lost them.
Look, Amy, I know it's not the best time, but I am deeply-- and we can deeply make up and forgive each other after you make sure Lana's okay.
I just wanna check on her.
If you see him coming-- you're number one on my speed dial.
Now go.
( Glass shatters )
Lana:
I didn't tell you you could come here.
Jesse:
You don't have to tell me anything.
I can do what I want, and I want to talk to you.
I'm done talking about this.
Let's go.
- (Jesse) I'm not going anywhere.
( Glass shatters )
Lana!
Lana!
( Gasps )
I told you to stay out of this.
I told you to stay away from her.
I can see why Lana broke up with you.
Not only are you a sarcastic jerk, but you're kind of slow.
- Rawr!
- Uh!
Aw, see, normally I'd apologize, but I decided to stop doing that today.
It's time somebody taught you some manners.
Well, you sure as hell are not the one to do it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
You?
So much better.
Thank you.
I suppose this means I have to give you your job back.
That's supposed to be my job.
I should have been there, not her.
- No offense.
- None taken.
Well, there's only one problem.
- What's that?
- You don't have a car.
( Girls laughing )
Hey.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Just been here waiting for you.
Don't we have some training to do?
Amy:
And make sure you don't leave out any of the important stuff.
Chloe has to know how to protect herself.
Alek:
That's what we've been trying--
He doesn't have a car.
Let's go.
I'll call you later.
( Beeps )
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
He's very handsome.
Looks a lot like you.
You shouldn't leave guns lying around the house.
Very dangerous.
I just wanted you to know that if the girl is so much as touched... that I know where to find you and your son.
Get out of my house.
Remember, whether we see each other again is entirely up to you.

I knew I could make that jump.
I meant this afternoon with your friend.
That could have ended very differently.
- It was important to me.
- I understand.
Your human friends are important to you.
And I'd do it again.
You keep telling me to follow my instincts.
That's what I did.
I might not always understand them, but I have to learn to trust them.
I know I might not be the kind of Uniter you were hoping for, but this is the one you've got.
You're exactly the kind that we were hoping for.
Maybe it's time Mai and humans stopped living in different worlds.
It's not gonna be easy, Chloe.
So much hope and so much fear all in one girl.
Like it or not, the whole world is coming for you.
Then let it come.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on "The Nine lives of Chloe King"...
That feeling I got when I first saw him in the church, it was like I was experiencing exactly what he was feeling.
This is the longest we've spent together since mom died.
What's that supposed to mean?
Dad, most fathers would be thrilled that their son actually wanted to spend time with them.
I like you a lot and I like being a around you.
If you need time, I'm in no hurry.
Something tells me we're going to be very good friends.
Alek!
Your mom, she's the leader of the Mai?
I'm sorry, Chloe, but your life is no longer your own.
Hey!
Wait up.
You're doing great.
Though I don't think an assassin would let you take a time out to catch your breath, at least none of the assassins I know.
And that's why we're training.
But you can't keep stopping to look for obstacles.
Assume they're going to be there and improvise.
Assume invisible obstacles.
Got it.
The Order won't tell you where the knives are gonna land.
That's why you're such a good teacher-- always bringing it back to a practical application.
Think she's ready?
- Ready for what?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna say yes, but there's only one way to find out.
Wait!
How come my opinion doesn't count for anything?
- And I'm thinking not.
- Chloe, you can do this.
I promise.
Back up and try again.
Stop acting like a little scaredy human.
But what if I am a little scaredy human?
No, you're Mai.
So stop thinking and start using your instinct.
I am, and my instincts are telling me that you people are crazy.
If Alek can do it, then I'm pretty sure you can.
Hey.
Fine.
It generally hurts less if you actually jump all the way across.
You didn't trust yourself.
Next time you might not be so lucky.
Not gonna be a next time.
Come on, we got a lot more work to do.

Morning.
Made your favorite-- cereal and bowl.
Some assembly required.
Oh excellent.
I was actually craving...
Unfrosted corn byproducts?
I thought I was supposed to enjoy my youth.
What happened to that box of sugary deliciousness?
Down your mother's gullet at 11:00 last night.
You're not the only one with cravings.
I think I'm gonna be late tonight.
It's okay.
It's Wednesday.
Ah, dinner with the dos amigos, yeah.
You going to Amy's this week?
I think burgers is the plan.
Already jealous.
Oh and, Chloe, what exactly were you doing last night?
I found your jeans on the bathroom floor with a huge hole in 'em.
Uh, you know me.
Wild child-- slinking down alleys, running across rooftops.
I tripped over the recycling bin coming in the side.
How many times have I told you that area-- the "are you okay?" Is implied as is the "I love you."
- Always is.
And I'm fine.
- Have a good day.
Ugh.
- For sure!
- You have to promise.
You can't tell anyone.
Devon's parents were and we totally-- night,
- Really?
- Sure did.
Yes, it's infected.
Yes, it hurt.
And yes, my mom's gonna kill me if she ever sees it.
Coach says a 4.9 won't even get college scouts interested.
Turn around.
Having fun?
I swear, I'm gonna tie a bell around your neck.
Stop sneaking up on me.
Maybe you would have heard if you weren't preoccupied.
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going to class.
And tuning into all the gossip?
So where do you think that tattoo actually is?
At least I think it's a tattoo she's talking about.
Ew!
And I wouldn't know.
It's just noise.
I can't really control it.
We'll have to work on that.
The hearing is there to alert you to danger.
- Meaning you?
- Meaning killers, executioners.
the assorted non-human predator.
You're not safe just because you stopped one man.
You have to learn to control your gifts.
It might mean between life and-- well, for you, losing another.
Is this your long-winded, slightly frightening way of saying that I have training again tonight?
- Jasmine will pick you up after work.
- Can't wait.
Has anyone ever told you that you're a close talker?
- Just you.
- It's not a compliment.
I'll see you later.
Oh and, Chloe, be careful.
One of these days something you won't like.
That's the third night in a row she's blown me off.
I seriously think I might be in the market for a new best friend.
- Hey, you.
- Hey.
You look industrious.
And before you think I'm getting all stalkery, this sidewalk happens between school and work-- you know, if I take the long way around the park and cut across Divisadero.
Oh yeah, no, you didn't have to do that.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Just in the middle of working on some stuff.
Organized is good.
Um, I texted you last night about that movie.
Blood, guts, flying limbs-
- I'm in.
I think I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
My dad-- let's just say he's being my dad-- and that's complex.
Rain checks happily accepted.
Well, I'd better go or I'm gonna be late.
And as of two minutes ago, I actually am late.
- See ya.
- See ya.
Mr. Rezza, a moment of your time.
- My employer is very upset.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
The Order does not exist to serve your personal vendettas.
Perhaps if you had listened when I tried to warn you...
The Mai now know of the girl's existence.
Plans were in place, but now she's guarded and protected.
Your involvement is no longer required.
We will dispose of the girl.
Expecting a call?
More like hoping for one.
I told Brian that we could only be friends.
And I thought he was okay with it, but-- you were being sarcastic.
Glad you caught that.
Hey, my friend Jasmine's coming by a little before 6:00 and I was wondering--
If you could stay to the end of your shift for a change?
It's like you're a mind reader.
Vintage.
Lana.
Look, hold on one second.
- Paul.
- Hey.
You're coming tonight, right?
It's my turn to pick.
Of course.
I would never miss dinner with my two best friends.
So is everything okay, you know, between you and me?
Paul?
Okay, to be honest, I have been a little hurt.
While I understand there's an unfortunate recurring borderline racist narrative in the American comic book pantheon of Asians being portrayed as subservient geeks or simply one-dimensional kung-fu-kicking bad-asses,
- I am none of those things.
- What are you talking about?
Why haven't you asked me to be your sidekick?
- My what?
- Your sidekick.
Your sidekick, your loyal and trusted confidant.
You, my friend, are already all of those things.
- Really?
- Really.
Unless I ever see you in tights.
Then the deal's off.
This conversation's over.
Chloe!
Whoops.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
For a second I just--
I felt completely terrified.
- She's not that scary.
- No.
It's like I was feeling what she was feeling.
She's the one who's terrified.
I know, I know...
Uh, whatever that weird sense thing is you got going on You might wanna get it adjusted.
But I don't even know what it is.
So you're saying you can read people's minds?
No, I can't tell what they're thinking.
I literally feel what they're feeling on an emotional level.
But I can't control it.
It just happens.
See, this is the part where you say, "Oh yeah, I get that all the time.
It's a Mai thing.
It's so not a big deal."
Sorry, I've never heard of anything like it.
Great, so my powers came with an extra scoop of freak.
That Chloe, always an overachiever.
Chloe, I really don't think it's anything to worry about.
But if it'll make you feel better, we can talk to my mom.
Hey, either of you "Lana Jacobs"?
No, sorry.
She left about a half an hour ago.
I guess that's why the instructions say to be here by 4:00.
Do you need me to sign for something?
I wish you could, but they're cupcakes, and these things go stale pretty quick.
And there is a God.
They included her home address.
411 Arden.
She moved, like, two weeks ago.
I'll write it down for you.
Thanks, I really appreciate that.
I think she could use a little cheering up.
Here you go.
All right.
Have a good one.
- What the hell?
- Chloe!
What's the matter with you?
I have no idea.
It's like I was possessed.
I mean the second he touched me.
I just felt this huge, giant wave of rage.
I just-
- I don't know how else to describe it.
That must have been so frightening.
For me and him.
I mean, he just kind of took off.
I wanted to go after him, but Jasmine--
Was right to bring you to me.
At this moment he's the least of your problems.
Something's wrong with me, Valentina.
Really wrong.
I think if Jasmine hadn't been there,
I-
- I might have tried to kill him.
And perhaps you would have.
So it's imperative that you learn to control this.
How am I supposed to control this when I don't even know what this is?
Valentina?
Do you know what the word "empathy" means?
Yeah, it's like if your friend feels bad, then you feel bad for them.
Close.
Empathy is directly experiencing the emotions of another person.
You, my child, are an empath.
Like being Mai and the Uniter wasn't enough?
Or more likely you have this gift because you are the Uniter.
Some of the very old legends claim that all Mai were once capable of this.
It's what bonded us to humans.
It's not surprising that you possess this quality.
You are the embodiment of all that is Mai.
So if I tried with you right now--
No, it was something that passed only between Mai and humans.
But it doesn't even work right.
I thought Lana was terrified and she was laughing.
And the delivery guy was maybe kind of annoyed, but he certainly wasn't out to kill anybody.
I know that you don't want to hear this, but perhaps you should limit your contact with humans.
What am I gonna do?
Ignore my family and friends?
I'm not saying forever.
Just until we have a better understanding.
Ugh, my friends!
Do you know what time it is?
- Chloe.
- I've gotta go.
Enough bad things have happened today without adding one more to the list.
Go.
Oh!
Supersized sorry.
Mm-hmm.
So I guess cats can't read clocks.
Amy, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Did Jasmine tell you what's going on with the mind melding?
You already ate?
Yeah, that's usually what we do when we go out to dinner.
- Please don't be this way.
- And which way is that?
Is it possible to get back to the crazy superpower
- portion of our evening?
- No.
Look, I know I've been a little flaky lately, but you didn't really mean it when you said you might be in the market for a new best friend, did you?
Who told you that?
I can't believe you told her that.
No, it wasn't Paul.
I just heard it.
I'm sorry.
This hearing thing isn't quite under control yet.
What else have you been listening to?
Have you ever heard of invasion of privacy?
Amy, you're missing the point.
No, I get it.
And A:
Obviously I didn't really mean it.
And B:
Now I think I just might.
The Chloe I know would never do something like that or treat her friends this way.
I gotta go.
I told the dads I wouldn't be late.
Some sidekick.
She's my ride.
Hey, kiddo.
Sorry I'm late.
Crazy day.
How was dinner?
- I didn't actually make it.
- Really?
I thought Wednesdays were practically sacred.
Are you gonna get on my case now too?
No, I am too tired to get on anyone's case.
Sorry.
I just feel like...
Do you ever have one of those days where you feel a little out of control?
Frequently.
- Wanna talk?
- Amy's pissed.
Angry.
Amy's mad at me for reasons only known to Amy.
Well, she's not used to waiting in line.
You've been spending all that time with your new friends.
And now you sound like her.
But it's not like she and Paul haven't been surgically joined at the hip.
Maybe you're just going through a little adjustment period.
I mean, as people grow up, sometimes-- do not finish that sentence.
She's my best friend.
Then I'm not quite sure what we're talking about.
You don't understand.
No, it doesn't seem like I do.
- Anything else bothering you?
- No.
Why?
It's just a sense.
But since you don't seem to be in the mood for spilling secrets or seeking motherly wisdom,
I'm gonna close up shop and go to bed.
But if you change your mind,
I will be open again in the morning.
- 'Night.
- 'Night.
Look, I know I asked for help, but this is like 600 radio stations playing at once.
I'll never be able to do it.
- Pick something.
- I can't.
- Just do what I tell you.
- Highly suspicious.
Don't be.
Now close your eyes.
It's so loud.
Hello?
Ignore it.
Listen to your breathing-- the air going in and out of your body.
Take your time.
The rest of the world doesn't matter.
There's only you and me.
Can you hear the clock?
Top of the tower.
- Alek.
- You can do this.
I can hear it.
There's a woman in the market haggling with a vendor.
All right, how about we do two for $50?
Now make it all go away.
You are in charge of the world around you.
- I don't know.
- Listen to my heartbeat.
Just that... and nothing else.
Did it work?
Yeah, it um-- it worked.
Thanks.
- Hey.
Is Chloe around?
- Not yet.
Thought she was always here in the afternoon.
You and me both.
Well, could you just tell her that--
Poised and ready.
Never mind.
I'll just give her a call.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I had to stay late for this class thing.
Your guy just left two seconds ago.
- Brian?
- Chloe.
You and I need to talk.
What happened here yesterday?
- You heard about that?
- I heard about it and somehow he thinks I'm the one who put you up to it.
The delivery guy?
- Why would he think that?
- What delivery guy?
How many guys did you knock over in here?
- I'm talking about Jesse.
- You know him?
Wish I didn't, but yeah.
He's my ex.
I'm sorry.
He never said he knew you, and he had your wrong address, so I--
Wait.
You're the one who gave him my new address?
I was trying to help.
He's the reason I moved out in the first place.
I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
- Chloe, this is so screwed up.
He's never gonna leave me alone now.
He's the reason you're so scared, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
This is none of your business.
But I'm right, aren't I?
Seriously, I'm warning you.
Let it go.
Lana, you have to do something.
I can help.
You know what would help?
If you just grabbed your stuff and you got out.
- I'm being serious.
- So am I.
Chloe, you're fired.
It didn't actually make sense until that moment.
You seem almost excited you got fired.
No, don't you get it?
It means I was right.
What I felt about Lana was right.
It's still very weird, but it's not completely wrong.
Has to make you feel better.
Bo staff...
Nunchucks, iodine-- I think we're good to go.
Shouldn't I have something to fight with?
No.
Tonight's lesson:
Avoidance.
Sometimes the best way to take a blow is to not be there when it lands.
Okay, crazy teenage ninja girl, don't you ever get tired of hitting me with things?
All the time, but my mom tasked me with training you.
Hmm, what if I work "avoidance" into a sentence and act like I took a bamboo pole to the head the next time I see her?
Then can we skip?
And what do you wanna do instead?
Spoons are in the top drawer.
So Jesse must have called Lana that afternoon when I got that feeling off her.
That's why she was so upset.
And if he's going around town pretending to be a delivery guy to get her address-- total nutjob, right?
Mm-hmm.
- Mm.
- Mm, so good.
Hey, you said that the Mai are always watching me, you know, to make sure I'm safe.
Could I get a couple of them to watch Lana instead?
Chloe, Lana can take care of herself.
I'm more worried--
What?
I don't think my mom's been completely honest with you.
It wasn't just that one scarface creep.
The Order's back.
They're here in San Francisco.
They're here for you.
I just get worried.
And I appreciate it.
I know this isn't the life you were expecting.
It's not all bad.
Is it bad if I have a little bit of each?
Not at all.
And I had to guess at what you might like.
You so didn't have to do this.
I know, but I wanted to apologize for being kind of rude the other day.
You weren't rude.
My head was just kind of somewhere else.
- Believe me, it's okay.
- No no, it's not.
We had that whole conversation about being friends, and which I'm fine with.
The truth is I actually don't have any friends here, which means that I don't really have anyone to talk to.
You can talk to me.
I know.
This is-- this is the reason I came home.
What's it to?
I think a safety deposit box, but I haven't been able to figure out where yet.
My mom supposedly was killed... in a mugging that went bad, but parts of it just never made sense to me.
I felt like my dad was never telling me the whole story.
But where'd you get the key?
It showed up at school about a month ago with a note on it--
"Do you really know what happened to your mother?"
At first I thought it was some sick joke, but then I realized I'm not really sure.
So now I'm here and I'm gonna stay until I figure it out.
I'm glad you told me.
Me too.
Feels good talking about it.
It's been bothering me for years.
I guess I kind of felt like I just had to do something about it.
I know the feeling.
Lana!
Lana, are you okay?
- What are you doing here?
- Did you tell them about Jesse?
Why would I do that?
Lana, come on, he had to have done this.
I really just want him to go away.
- You have to tell the police.
- Tell them what?
That I think some guy who can't quite grasp the concept of "I never wanna see you again" broke in here?
Why, to teach me a lesson?
He may be a major-league jerk with some serious control issues,
- but he's not violent.
- What do you call this?
I don't know.
My boss is gonna kill me.
I was just hoping if I ignore him...
This is already embarrassing enough.
Please, let me deal with this on my own.
- Lana.
- I'm a big girl, Chloe.
I can handle myself.
What's going on?
Is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
- Lana...
- Her ex-boyfriend's terrorizing her.
I'm almost sure he's the one who broke into the store.
So you were totally right.
Was there ever any question?
I just have to figure out what to do.
Maybe you should call Alek and Jasmine.
I'm sure they can help you make it all better.
Amy, look, I'm sorry if--
No, I'm not gonna say it, 'cause I'm pretty much done apologizing.
You said that the Chloe you know would never do this or act this way.
Well, newsflash:
I'm not the same old Chloe.
We can pretend that I am, but we all know it's not true.
You've always been my best friend.
And if it's up to me, you always will be.
But you have to accept me as I am now, faults, claws and all.
If you can't, I get it.
Not happy, but I get it.
And the next time you get jealous of the time I spend with Alek and Jasmine, try and remember that I'm only doing it so I don't have to die again.
Hello again.
You know the police are, like, 2' away.
Call them.
I'd love to tell them how you assaulted me the other night
- for absolutely no reason.
- Stay away from her.
What happens between me and Lana is none of your business.
But if you don't back off,
I'll make sure that you're my business.
Don't be an idiot.
If he ever comes within 10' of you again, I will personally rip out his lungs.
How about you just keep him away from Lana?
Chloe, I know you've already been warned.
This isn't your fight.
You've gotta get your priorities straight.
I can't just walk away.
There's nothing else you can do.
Now please just go home.
- But Lana--
- You heard her.
She can take care of herself.
Stop watching me.
You know I can't do that.
Oh my God.
Chloe, why didn't you tell me all of this was going on?
I don't think I was completely sure until now.
Well, now that you know, you are gonna stay far far away from this whole situation.
- But, mom--
- No, I don't think you understand how dangerous a guy like this can be.
If Lana doesn't call the police, I will.
But what if that makes it worse?
Doing nothing seldom makes problems go away.
This is what's been bothering you, isn't it?
What?
I knew something was up with you.
I just-
- I didn't know what it was.
How did you know?
Face it, kid, we're bonded.
You feel bad or sad, I feel bad or sad, even if I don't know the reason.
I can't even help it.
I think that means you're empathic.
No, that means I'm your mother.
You know, you don't have to go through all this stuff alone.
We, you and me, are a team.
Thanks.
Go, team us.
Do you think Lana's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
I hope so.
And I know you wanna help, but right now it's up to Lana.
You've let her know you're there.
But it's her life.
She has to take control of it.
I don't know if it's always that easy.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Nothing.
Just hanging out, hoping to catch a glimpse of the old man.
I noticed mom's picture isn't out anymore.
Well, sometimes it's best not to live in the past.
It was hard seeing her smiling face staring up at me every day like nothing bad had ever happened.
I keep the one of the three of us-- that summer on the boat.
I keep that next to my bed.
It was a good trip.
Maybe we can do it again.
Finally catch that marlin.
It'd be good to get away together one of these days.
I'm glad you're home.
Thanks.
Me too.
Hey, Lana, me again.
The fifth message, but I'm worried.
So just call me, please?
Amy?
Before you say anything, you were right and I was wrong.
I was the one being a bad friend.
I was afraid of losing you.
- Amy--
- I was completely self-involved.
I wasn't even trying to see things from your point of view.
- Amy!
- What?
I need you.
Can you come over?
I'm outside in my car waiting for you to forgive me, dummy.
You're the one who said you wanted to go fast to make sure we're not being followed.
I'm pretty sure we lost them.
Look, Amy, I know it's not the best time, but I am deeply-- and we can deeply make up and forgive each other after you make sure Lana's okay.
I just wanna check on her.
If you see him coming-- you're number one on my speed dial.
Now go.
I didn't tell you you could come here.
You don't have to tell me anything.
I can do what I want, and I want to talk to you.
I'm done talking about this.
Let's go.
I'm not going anywhere.
Lana!
Lana!
I told you to stay out of this.
I told you to stay away from her.
I can see why Lana broke up with you.
Not only are you a sarcastic jerk, but you're kind of slow.
- Rawr!
- Uh!
Aw, see, normally I'd apologize, but I decided to stop doing that today.
It's time somebody taught you some manners.
Well, you sure as hell are not the one to do it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
You?
So much better.
Thank you.
I suppose this means I have to give you your job back.
That's supposed to be my job.
I should have been there, not her.
- No offense.
- None taken.
Well, there's only one problem.
- What's that?
- You don't have a car.
Hey.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Just been here waiting for you.
Don't we have some training to do?
And make sure you don't leave out any of the important stuff.
Chloe has to know how to protect herself.
That's what we've been trying--
He doesn't have a car.
Let's go.
I'll call you later.
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
He's very handsome.
Looks a lot like you.
You shouldn't leave guns lying around the house.
Very dangerous.
I just wanted you to know that if the girl is so much as touched... that I know where to find you and your son.
Get out of my house.
Remember, whether we see each other again is entirely up to you.

I hear you've been taking some unnecessary risks.
I knew I could make that jump.
I meant this afternoon with your friend.
That could have ended very differently.
- It was important to me.
- I understand.
Your human friends are important to you.
And I'd do it again.
You keep telling me to follow my instincts.
That's what I did.
I might not always understand them, but I have to learn to trust them.
I know I might not be the kind of Uniter you were hoping for, but this is the one you've got.
You're exactly the kind that we were hoping for.
Maybe it's time Mai and humans stopped living in different worlds.
It's not gonna be easy, Chloe.
So much hope and so much fear all in one girl.
Like it or not, the whole world is coming for you.
Then let it come.

Previously on "The Nine lives of Chloe King"...
Chloe:
That feeling I got when I first saw him in the church, it was like I was experiencing exactly what he was feeling.
This is the longest we've spent together since mom died.
What's that supposed to mean?
Dad, most fathers would be thrilled that their son actually wanted to spend time with them.
I like you a lot and I like being a around you.
If you need time, I'm in no hurry.
Something tells me we're going to be very good friends.
Alek!
Your mom, she's the leader of the Mai?
I'm sorry, Chloe, but your life is no longer your own.
( Panting )
Hey!
Wait up.
You're doing great.
Though I don't think an assassin would let you take a time out to catch your breath, at least none of the assassins I know.
And that's why we're training.
But you can't keep stopping to look for obstacles.
Assume they're going to be there and improvise.
Assume invisible obstacles.
Got it.
The Order won't tell you where the knives are gonna land.
That's why you're such a good teacher-- always bringing it back to a practical application.
Think she's ready?
- Ready for what?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna say yes, but there's only one way to find out.
Wait!
How come my opinion doesn't count for anything?
- And I'm thinking not.
- Chloe, you can do this.
I promise.
Back up and try again.
Stop acting like a little scaredy human.
But what if I am a little scaredy human?
No, you're Mai.
So stop thinking and start using your instinct.
I am, and my instincts are telling me that you people are crazy.
If Alek can do it, then I'm pretty sure you can.
Hey.
( Sighs ) Fine.
( Grunting )
It generally hurts less if you actually jump all the way across.
You didn't trust yourself.
Next time you might not be so lucky.
Not gonna be a next time.
Come on, we got a lot more work to do.

Morning.
Made your favorite-- cereal and bowl.
Some assembly required.
Oh excellent.
I was actually craving...
Unfrosted corn byproducts?
I thought I was supposed to enjoy my youth.
What happened to that box of sugary deliciousness?
Down your mother's gullet at 11:00 last night.
You're not the only one with cravings.
I think I'm gonna be late tonight.
It's okay.
It's Wednesday.
Ah, dinner with the dos amigos, yeah.
You going to Amy's this week?
I think burgers is the plan.
Already jealous.
Oh and, Chloe, what exactly were you doing last night?
( coughs )
I found your jeans on the bathroom floor with a huge hole in 'em.
Uh, you know me.
Wild child-- slinking down alleys, running across rooftops.
I tripped over the recycling bin coming in the side.
How many times have I told you that area-- the "are you okay?" Is implied as is the "I love you."
- Always is.
And I'm fine.
- Have a good day.
Ugh.
( Students laughing )
- (Girl) For sure!
- You have to promise.
You can't tell anyone.
Devon's parents were and we totally-- night,
- (girl #2) Really?
- (Girl #3) Sure did.
Yes, it's infected.
Yes, it hurt.
And yes, my mom's gonna kill me if she ever sees it.
Coach says a 4.9 won't even get college scouts interested.
Turn around.
Having fun?
I swear, I'm gonna tie a bell around your neck.
Stop sneaking up on me.
Maybe you would have heard if you weren't preoccupied.
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going to class.
And tuning into all the gossip?
So where do you think that tattoo actually is?
At least I think it's a tattoo she's talking about.
Ew!
And I wouldn't know.
It's just noise.
I can't really control it.
We'll have to work on that.
The hearing is there to alert you to danger.
- Meaning you?
- Meaning killers, executioners.
the assorted non-human predator.
You're not safe just because you stopped one man.
You have to learn to control your gifts.
It might mean between life and-- well, for you, losing another.
Is this your long-winded, slightly frightening way of saying that I have training again tonight?
- Jasmine will pick you up after work.
- Can't wait.
Has anyone ever told you that you're a close talker?
- Just you.
- It's not a compliment.
I'll see you later.
Oh and, Chloe, be careful.
One of these days something you won't like.
That's the third night in a row she's blown me off.
I seriously think I might be in the market for a new best friend.
- Hey, you.
- Hey.
You look industrious.
And before you think I'm getting all stalkery, this sidewalk happens between school and work-- you know, if I take the long way around the park and cut across Divisadero.
Oh yeah, no, you didn't have to do that.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Just in the middle of working on some stuff.
Organized is good.
Um, I texted you last night about that movie.
Blood, guts, flying limbs-
- I'm in.
I think I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
My dad-- let's just say he's being my dad-- and that's complex.
Rain checks happily accepted.
Well, I'd better go or I'm gonna be late.
And as of two minutes ago, I actually am late.
- See ya.
- See ya.
( Sighs )
Mr. Rezza, a moment of your time.
- My employer is very upset.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
The Order does not exist to serve your personal vendettas.
Perhaps if you had listened when I tried to warn you...
The Mai now know of the girl's existence.
Plans were in place, but now she's guarded and protected.
Your involvement is no longer required.
We will dispose of the girl.
Expecting a call?
More like hoping for one.
I told Brian that we could only be friends.
And I thought he was okay with it, but-- you were being sarcastic.
Glad you caught that.
Hey, my friend Jasmine's coming by a little before 6:00 and I was wondering--
If you could stay to the end of your shift for a change?
It's like you're a mind reader.
- ( Phone ringing )
- Vintage.
Lana.
Look, hold on one second.
- Paul.
- Hey.
You're coming tonight, right?
It's my turn to pick.
Of course.
I would never miss dinner with my two best friends.
So is everything okay, you know, between you and me?
Paul?
Okay, to be honest, I have been a little hurt.
While I understand there's an unfortunate recurring borderline racist narrative in the American comic book pantheon of Asians being portrayed as subservient geeks or simply one-dimensional kung-fu-kicking bad-asses,
- I am none of those things.
- What are you talking about?
Why haven't you asked me to be your sidekick?
- My what?
- Your sidekick.
Your sidekick, your loyal and trusted confidant.
You, my friend, are already all of those things.
- Really?
- Really.
Unless I ever see you in tights.
Then the deal's off.
- ( Laughs )
- This conversation's over.
( Beep )
- Chloe!
Whoops.
- ( Gasps )
- What's wrong?
I don't know.
For a second I just--
I felt completely terrified.
- She's not that scary.
- No.
It's like I was feeling what she was feeling.
She's the one who's terrified.
Lana:
I know, I know...
Uh, whatever that weird sense thing is you got going on...
- ( Laughing ) ...You might wanna get it adjusted.
But I don't even know what it is.
So you're saying you can read people's minds?
No, I can't tell what they're thinking.
I literally feel what they're feeling on an emotional level.
But I can't control it.
It just happens.
See, this is the part where you say, "Oh yeah, I get that all the time.
It's a Mai thing.
It's so not a big deal."
Sorry, I've never heard of anything like it.
Great, so my powers came with an extra scoop of freak.
That Chloe, always an overachiever.
Chloe, I really don't think it's anything to worry about.
But if it'll make you feel better, we can talk to my mom.
( Bell jingles )
Hey, either of you "Lana Jacobs"?
No, sorry.
She left about a half an hour ago.
I guess that's why the instructions say to be here by 4:00.
Do you need me to sign for something?
I wish you could, but they're cupcakes, and these things go stale pretty quick.
And there is a God.
They included her home address.
411 Arden.
She moved, like, two weeks ago.
I'll write it down for you.
Thanks, I really appreciate that.
I think she could use a little cheering up.
Here you go.
All right.
Have a good one.
- ( Chloe gasps ) - ( Grunts )
- What the hell?
- Chloe!
What's the matter with you?
I have no idea.
It's like I was possessed.
I mean the second he touched me.
I just felt this huge, giant wave of rage.
I just-
- I don't know how else to describe it.
That must have been so frightening.
For me and him.
I mean, he just kind of took off.
I wanted to go after him, but Jasmine--
Was right to bring you to me.
At this moment he's the least of your problems.
Something's wrong with me, Valentina.
Really wrong.
I think if Jasmine hadn't been there,
I-
- I might have tried to kill him.
And perhaps you would have.
So it's imperative that you learn to control this.
How am I supposed to control this when I don't even know what this is?
Valentina?
Do you know what the word "empathy" means?
Yeah, it's like if your friend feels bad, then you feel bad for them.
Close.
Empathy is directly experiencing the emotions of another person.
You, my child, are an empath.
Like being Mai and the Uniter wasn't enough?
Or more likely you have this gift because you are the Uniter.
Some of the very old legends claim that all Mai were once capable of this.
It's what bonded us to humans.
It's not surprising that you possess this quality.
You are the embodiment of all that is Mai.
So if I tried with you right now--
No, it was something that passed only between Mai and humans.
But it doesn't even work right.
I thought Lana was terrified and she was laughing.
And the delivery guy was maybe kind of annoyed, but he certainly wasn't out to kill anybody.
I know that you don't want to hear this, but perhaps you should limit your contact with humans.
What am I gonna do?
Ignore my family and friends?
I'm not saying forever.
Just until we have a better understanding.
( Gasps ) Ugh, my friends!
Do you know what time it is?
- Chloe.
- I've gotta go.
Enough bad things have happened today without adding one more to the list.
Go.
Oh!
Supersized sorry.
Mm-hmm.
So I guess cats can't read clocks.
Amy, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Did Jasmine tell you what's going on with the mind melding?
You already ate?
Yeah, that's usually what we do when we go out to dinner.
- Please don't be this way.
- And which way is that?
Is it possible to get back to the crazy superpower
- portion of our evening?
- (Chloe and Amy) No.
Look, I know I've been a little flaky lately, but you didn't really mean it when you said you might be in the market for a new best friend, did you?
Who told you that?
I can't believe you told her that.
No, it wasn't Paul.
I just heard it.
I'm sorry.
This hearing thing isn't quite under control yet.
What else have you been listening to?
Have you ever heard of invasion of privacy?
Amy, you're missing the point.
No, I get it.
And A:
Obviously I didn't really mean it.
And B:
Now I think I just might.
The Chloe I know would never do something like that or treat her friends this way.
I gotta go.
I told the dads I wouldn't be late.
Some sidekick.
She's my ride.
Meredith:
Hey, kiddo.
Sorry I'm late.
Crazy day.
How was dinner?
- I didn't actually make it.
- Really?
I thought Wednesdays were practically sacred.
Are you gonna get on my case now too?
No, I am too tired to get on anyone's case.
Sorry.
I just feel like...
( Sighs )
Do you ever have one of those days where you feel a little out of control?
Frequently.
- Wanna talk?
- Amy's pissed.
Angry.
Amy's mad at me for reasons only known to Amy.
Well, she's not used to waiting in line.
You've been spending all that time with your new friends.
And now you sound like her.
But it's not like she and Paul haven't been surgically joined at the hip.
Maybe you're just going through a little adjustment period.
I mean, as people grow up, sometimes-- do not finish that sentence.
She's my best friend.
Then I'm not quite sure what we're talking about.
You don't understand.
No, it doesn't seem like I do.
- Anything else bothering you?
- No.
Why?
It's just a sense.
But since you don't seem to be in the mood for spilling secrets or seeking motherly wisdom,
I'm gonna close up shop and go to bed.
But if you change your mind,
I will be open again in the morning.
- 'Night.
- 'Night.
( Sighs )
Look, I know I asked for help, but this is like 600 radio stations playing at once.
I'll never be able to do it.
- Pick something.
- I can't.
- Just do what I tell you.
- Highly suspicious.
Don't be.
Now close your eyes.
( Siren wailing ) ( Baby crying )
( Squeaking )
It's so loud.
- ( Cell phone ringing )
- Hello?
Alek:
Ignore it.
Listen to your breathing-- the air going in and out of your body.
Take your time.
The rest of the world doesn't matter.
There's only you and me.
( Exhales )
Can you hear the clock?
Top of the tower.
- Alek.
- You can do this.
( Faint ticking )
- I can hear it.
( Ticking louder )
There's a woman in the market haggling with a vendor.
All right, how about we do two for $50?
Alek:
Now make it all go away.
You are in charge of the world around you.
- I don't know.
- Listen to my heartbeat.
Just that... and nothing else.
( Heart beating, background noise fades )
Did it work?
Yeah, it um-- it worked.
Thanks.
- Hey.
Is Chloe around?
- Not yet.
Thought she was always here in the afternoon.
You and me both.
Well, could you just tell her that--
Poised and ready.
Never mind.
I'll just give her a call.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I had to stay late for this class thing.
Your guy just left two seconds ago.
- Brian?
- Chloe.
You and I need to talk.
What happened here yesterday?
- You heard about that?
- I heard about it and somehow he thinks I'm the one who put you up to it.
The delivery guy?
- Why would he think that?
- What delivery guy?
How many guys did you knock over in here?
- I'm talking about Jesse.
- You know him?
Wish I didn't, but yeah.
He's my ex.
I'm sorry.
He never said he knew you, and he had your wrong address, so I--
Wait.
You're the one who gave him my new address?
I was trying to help.
He's the reason I moved out in the first place.
I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
- Chloe, this is so screwed up.
He's never gonna leave me alone now.
He's the reason you're so scared, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
This is none of your business.
But I'm right, aren't I?
Seriously, I'm warning you.
Let it go.
Lana, you have to do something.
I can help.
You know what would help?
If you just grabbed your stuff and you got out.
- I'm being serious.
- So am I.
Chloe, you're fired.
It didn't actually make sense until that moment.
You seem almost excited you got fired.
No, don't you get it?
It means I was right.
What I felt about Lana was right.
It's still very weird, but it's not completely wrong.
Has to make you feel better.
Bo staff...
Nunchucks, iodine-- I think we're good to go.
Shouldn't I have something to fight with?
No.
Tonight's lesson:
Avoidance.
Sometimes the best way to take a blow is to not be there when it lands.
Okay, crazy teenage ninja girl, don't you ever get tired of hitting me with things?
All the time, but my mom tasked me with training you.
Hmm, what if I work "avoidance" into a sentence and act like I took a bamboo pole to the head the next time I see her?
Then can we skip?
And what do you wanna do instead?
Spoons are in the top drawer.
So Jesse must have called Lana that afternoon when I got that feeling off her.
That's why she was so upset.
And if he's going around town pretending to be a delivery guy to get her address-- total nutjob, right?
Mm-hmm.
- Mm.
- Mm, so good.
Hey, you said that the Mai are always watching me, you know, to make sure I'm safe.
Could I get a couple of them to watch Lana instead?
Chloe, Lana can take care of herself.
I'm more worried--
What?
I don't think my mom's been completely honest with you.
It wasn't just that one scarface creep.
The Order's back.
They're here in San Francisco.
They're here for you.
I just get worried.
And I appreciate it.
I know this isn't the life you were expecting.
( Cell phone chiming )
It's not all bad.
Is it bad if I have a little bit of each?
Not at all.
And I had to guess at what you might like.
You so didn't have to do this.
I know, but I wanted to apologize for being kind of rude the other day.
You weren't rude.
My head was just kind of somewhere else.
- Believe me, it's okay.
- No no, it's not.
We had that whole conversation about being friends, and which I'm fine with.
The truth is I actually don't have any friends here, which means that I don't really have anyone to talk to.
You can talk to me.
I know.
This is-- this is the reason I came home.
What's it to?
I think a safety deposit box, but I haven't been able to figure out where yet.
My mom supposedly was killed... in a mugging that went bad, but parts of it just never made sense to me.
I felt like my dad was never telling me the whole story.
But where'd you get the key?
It showed up at school about a month ago with a note on it--
"Do you really know what happened to your mother?"
At first I thought it was some sick joke, but then I realized I'm not really sure.
So now I'm here and I'm gonna stay until I figure it out.
I'm glad you told me.
Me too.
Feels good talking about it.
It's been bothering me for years.
I guess I kind of felt like I just had to do something about it.
I know the feeling.
( Siren chirping )
Lana!
Lana, are you okay?
- What are you doing here?
- Did you tell them about Jesse?
Why would I do that?
Lana, come on, he had to have done this.
I really just want him to go away.
- You have to tell the police.
- Tell them what?
That I think some guy who can't quite grasp the concept of "I never wanna see you again" broke in here?
Why, to teach me a lesson?
He may be a major-league jerk with some serious control issues,
- but he's not violent.
- What do you call this?
I don't know.
My boss is gonna kill me.
I was just hoping if I ignore him...
This is already embarrassing enough.
Please, let me deal with this on my own.
- Lana.
- I'm a big girl, Chloe.
I can handle myself.
What's going on?
Is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
- Lana...
- Her ex-boyfriend's terrorizing her.
I'm almost sure he's the one who broke into the store.
So you were totally right.
Was there ever any question?
I just have to figure out what to do.
Maybe you should call Alek and Jasmine.
I'm sure they can help you make it all better.
Amy, look, I'm sorry if--
No, I'm not gonna say it, 'cause I'm pretty much done apologizing.
You said that the Chloe you know would never do this or act this way.
Well, newsflash:
I'm not the same old Chloe.
We can pretend that I am, but we all know it's not true.
You've always been my best friend.
And if it's up to me, you always will be.
But you have to accept me as I am now, faults, claws and all.
If you can't, I get it.
Not happy, but I get it.
And the next time you get jealous of the time I spend with Alek and Jasmine, try and remember that I'm only doing it so I don't have to die again.
Hello again.
You know the police are, like, 2' away.
Call them.
I'd love to tell them how you assaulted me the other night
- for absolutely no reason.
- Stay away from her.
What happens between me and Lana is none of your business.
But if you don't back off,
I'll make sure that you're my business.
Don't be an idiot.
If he ever comes within 10' of you again, I will personally rip out his lungs.
How about you just keep him away from Lana?
Chloe, I know you've already been warned.
This isn't your fight.
You've gotta get your priorities straight.
I can't just walk away.
There's nothing else you can do.
Now please just go home.
- But Lana--
- You heard her.
She can take care of herself.
Stop watching me.
You know I can't do that.
Meredith:
Oh my God.
Chloe, why didn't you tell me all of this was going on?
I don't think I was completely sure until now.
Well, now that you know, you are gonna stay far far away from this whole situation.
- But, mom--
- No, I don't think you understand how dangerous a guy like this can be.
If Lana doesn't call the police, I will.
But what if that makes it worse?
Doing nothing seldom makes problems go away.
This is what's been bothering you, isn't it?
What?
I knew something was up with you.
I just-
- I didn't know what it was.
How did you know?
Face it, kid, we're bonded.
You feel bad or sad, I feel bad or sad, even if I don't know the reason.
I can't even help it.
I think that means you're empathic.
No, that means I'm your mother.
You know, you don't have to go through all this stuff alone.
We, you and me, are a team.
Thanks.
Go, team us.
Do you think Lana's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
I hope so.
And I know you wanna help, but right now it's up to Lana.
You've let her know you're there.
But it's her life.
She has to take control of it.
I don't know if it's always that easy.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Nothing.
Just hanging out, hoping to catch a glimpse of the old man.
I noticed mom's picture isn't out anymore.
Well, sometimes it's best not to live in the past.
It was hard seeing her smiling face staring up at me every day like nothing bad had ever happened.
I keep the one of the three of us-- that summer on the boat.
I keep that next to my bed.
It was a good trip.
Maybe we can do it again.
Finally catch that marlin.
It'd be good to get away together one of these days.
I'm glad you're home.
Thanks.
Me too.
( Phone rings )
Hey, Lana, me again.
The fifth message, but I'm worried.
So just call me, please?
- ( Phone chimes, beeps )
- Amy?
Before you say anything, you were right and I was wrong.
I was the one being a bad friend.
I was afraid of losing you.
- Amy--
- I was completely self-involved.
I wasn't even trying to see things from your point of view.
- Amy!
- What?
I need you.
Can you come over?
I'm outside in my car waiting for you to forgive me, dummy.
( Beeps )
( Tires screech )
You're the one who said you wanted to go fast to make sure we're not being followed.
I'm pretty sure we lost them.
Look, Amy, I know it's not the best time, but I am deeply-- and we can deeply make up and forgive each other after you make sure Lana's okay.
I just wanna check on her.
If you see him coming-- you're number one on my speed dial.
Now go.
( Glass shatters )
Lana:
I didn't tell you you could come here.
Jesse:
You don't have to tell me anything.
I can do what I want, and I want to talk to you.
I'm done talking about this.
Let's go.
- (Jesse) I'm not going anywhere.
( Glass shatters )
Lana!
Lana!
( Gasps )
I told you to stay out of this.
I told you to stay away from her.
I can see why Lana broke up with you.
Not only are you a sarcastic jerk, but you're kind of slow.
- Rawr!
- Uh!
Aw, see, normally I'd apologize, but I decided to stop doing that today.
It's time somebody taught you some manners.
Well, you sure as hell are not the one to do it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
You?
So much better.
Thank you.
I suppose this means I have to give you your job back.
That's supposed to be my job.
I should have been there, not her.
- No offense.
- None taken.
Well, there's only one problem.
- What's that?
- You don't have a car.
( Girls laughing )
Hey.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Just been here waiting for you.
Don't we have some training to do?
Amy:
And make sure you don't leave out any of the important stuff.
Chloe has to know how to protect herself.
Alek:
That's what we've been trying--
He doesn't have a car.
Let's go.
I'll call you later.
( Beeps )
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
He's very handsome.
Looks a lot like you.
You shouldn't leave guns lying around the house.
Very dangerous.
I just wanted you to know that if the girl is so much as touched... that I know where to find you and your son.
Get out of my house.
Remember, whether we see each other again is entirely up to you.

I knew I could make that jump.
I meant this afternoon with your friend.
That could have ended very differently.
- It was important to me.
- I understand.
Your human friends are important to you.
And I'd do it again.
You keep telling me to follow my instincts.
That's what I did.
I might not always understand them, but I have to learn to trust them.
I know I might not be the kind of Uniter you were hoping for, but this is the one you've got.
You're exactly the kind that we were hoping for.
Maybe it's time Mai and humans stopped living in different worlds.
It's not gonna be easy, Chloe.
So much hope and so much fear all in one girl.
Like it or not, the whole world is coming for you.
Then let it come.

Previously on "The Nine lives of Chloe King"...
Chloe:
That feeling I got when I first saw him in the church, it was like I was experiencing exactly what he was feeling.
This is the longest we've spent together since mom died.
What's that supposed to mean?
Dad, most fathers would be thrilled that their son actually wanted to spend time with them.
I like you a lot and I like being a around you.
If you need time, I'm in no hurry.
Something tells me we're going to be very good friends.
Alek!
Your mom, she's the leader of the Mai?
I'm sorry, Chloe, but your life is no longer your own.
( Panting )
Hey!
Wait up.
You're doing great.
Though I don't think an assassin would let you take a time out to catch your breath, at least none of the assassins I know.
And that's why we're training.
But you can't keep stopping to look for obstacles.
Assume they're going to be there and improvise.
Assume invisible obstacles.
Got it.
The Order won't tell you where the knives are gonna land.
That's why you're such a good teacher-- always bringing it back to a practical application.
Think she's ready?
- Ready for what?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna say yes, but there's only one way to find out.
Wait!
How come my opinion doesn't count for anything?
- And I'm thinking not.
- Chloe, you can do this.
I promise.
Back up and try again.
Stop acting like a little scaredy human.
But what if I am a little scaredy human?
No, you're Mai.
So stop thinking and start using your instinct.
I am, and my instincts are telling me that you people are crazy.
If Alek can do it, then I'm pretty sure you can.
Hey.
( Sighs ) Fine.
( Grunting )
It generally hurts less if you actually jump all the way across.
You didn't trust yourself.
Next time you might not be so lucky.
Not gonna be a next time.
Come on, we got a lot more work to do.

Morning.
Made your favorite-- cereal and bowl.
Some assembly required.
Oh excellent.
I was actually craving...
Unfrosted corn byproducts?
I thought I was supposed to enjoy my youth.
What happened to that box of sugary deliciousness?
Down your mother's gullet at 11:00 last night.
You're not the only one with cravings.
I think I'm gonna be late tonight.
It's okay.
It's Wednesday.
Ah, dinner with the dos amigos, yeah.
You going to Amy's this week?
I think burgers is the plan.
Already jealous.
Oh and, Chloe, what exactly were you doing last night?
( coughs )
I found your jeans on the bathroom floor with a huge hole in 'em.
Uh, you know me.
Wild child-- slinking down alleys, running across rooftops.
I tripped over the recycling bin coming in the side.
How many times have I told you that area-- the "are you okay?" Is implied as is the "I love you."
- Always is.
And I'm fine.
- Have a good day.
Ugh.
( Students laughing )
- (Girl) For sure!
- You have to promise.
You can't tell anyone.
Devon's parents were and we totally-- night,
- (girl #2) Really?
- (Girl #3) Sure did.
Yes, it's infected.
Yes, it hurt.
And yes, my mom's gonna kill me if she ever sees it.
Coach says a 4.9 won't even get college scouts interested.
Turn around.
Having fun?
I swear, I'm gonna tie a bell around your neck.
Stop sneaking up on me.
Maybe you would have heard if you weren't preoccupied.
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going to class.
And tuning into all the gossip?
So where do you think that tattoo actually is?
At least I think it's a tattoo she's talking about.
Ew!
And I wouldn't know.
It's just noise.
I can't really control it.
We'll have to work on that.
The hearing is there to alert you to danger.
- Meaning you?
- Meaning killers, executioners.
the assorted non-human predator.
You're not safe just because you stopped one man.
You have to learn to control your gifts.
It might mean between life and-- well, for you, losing another.
Is this your long-winded, slightly frightening way of saying that I have training again tonight?
- Jasmine will pick you up after work.
- Can't wait.
Has anyone ever told you that you're a close talker?
- Just you.
- It's not a compliment.
I'll see you later.
Oh and, Chloe, be careful.
One of these days something you won't like.
That's the third night in a row she's blown me off.
I seriously think I might be in the market for a new best friend.
- Hey, you.
- Hey.
You look industrious.
And before you think I'm getting all stalkery, this sidewalk happens between school and work-- you know, if I take the long way around the park and cut across Divisadero.
Oh yeah, no, you didn't have to do that.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Just in the middle of working on some stuff.
Organized is good.
Um, I texted you last night about that movie.
Blood, guts, flying limbs-
- I'm in.
I think I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
My dad-- let's just say he's being my dad-- and that's complex.
Rain checks happily accepted.
Well, I'd better go or I'm gonna be late.
And as of two minutes ago, I actually am late.
- See ya.
- See ya.
( Sighs )
Mr. Rezza, a moment of your time.
- My employer is very upset.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
The Order does not exist to serve your personal vendettas.
Perhaps if you had listened when I tried to warn you...
The Mai now know of the girl's existence.
Plans were in place, but now she's guarded and protected.
Your involvement is no longer required.
We will dispose of the girl.
Expecting a call?
More like hoping for one.
I told Brian that we could only be friends.
And I thought he was okay with it, but-- you were being sarcastic.
Glad you caught that.
Hey, my friend Jasmine's coming by a little before 6:00 and I was wondering--
If you could stay to the end of your shift for a change?
It's like you're a mind reader.
- ( Phone ringing )
- Vintage.
Lana.
Look, hold on one second.
- Paul.
- Hey.
You're coming tonight, right?
It's my turn to pick.
Of course.
I would never miss dinner with my two best friends.
So is everything okay, you know, between you and me?
Paul?
Okay, to be honest, I have been a little hurt.
While I understand there's an unfortunate recurring borderline racist narrative in the American comic book pantheon of Asians being portrayed as subservient geeks or simply one-dimensional kung-fu-kicking bad-asses,
- I am none of those things.
- What are you talking about?
Why haven't you asked me to be your sidekick?
- My what?
- Your sidekick.
Your sidekick, your loyal and trusted confidant.
You, my friend, are already all of those things.
- Really?
- Really.
Unless I ever see you in tights.
Then the deal's off.
- ( Laughs )
- This conversation's over.
( Beep )
- Chloe!
Whoops.
- ( Gasps )
- What's wrong?
I don't know.
For a second I just--
I felt completely terrified.
- She's not that scary.
- No.
It's like I was feeling what she was feeling.
She's the one who's terrified.
Lana:
I know, I know...
Uh, whatever that weird sense thing is you got going on...
- ( Laughing ) ...You might wanna get it adjusted.
But I don't even know what it is.
So you're saying you can read people's minds?
No, I can't tell what they're thinking.
I literally feel what they're feeling on an emotional level.
But I can't control it.
It just happens.
See, this is the part where you say, "Oh yeah, I get that all the time.
It's a Mai thing.
It's so not a big deal."
Sorry, I've never heard of anything like it.
Great, so my powers came with an extra scoop of freak.
That Chloe, always an overachiever.
Chloe, I really don't think it's anything to worry about.
But if it'll make you feel better, we can talk to my mom.
( Bell jingles )
Hey, either of you "Lana Jacobs"?
No, sorry.
She left about a half an hour ago.
I guess that's why the instructions say to be here by 4:00.
Do you need me to sign for something?
I wish you could, but they're cupcakes, and these things go stale pretty quick.
And there is a God.
They included her home address.
411 Arden.
She moved, like, two weeks ago.
I'll write it down for you.
Thanks, I really appreciate that.
I think she could use a little cheering up.
Here you go.
All right.
Have a good one.
- ( Chloe gasps ) - ( Grunts )
- What the hell?
- Chloe!
What's the matter with you?
I have no idea.
It's like I was possessed.
I mean the second he touched me.
I just felt this huge, giant wave of rage.
I just-
- I don't know how else to describe it.
That must have been so frightening.
For me and him.
I mean, he just kind of took off.
I wanted to go after him, but Jasmine--
Was right to bring you to me.
At this moment he's the least of your problems.
Something's wrong with me, Valentina.
Really wrong.
I think if Jasmine hadn't been there,
I-
- I might have tried to kill him.
And perhaps you would have.
So it's imperative that you learn to control this.
How am I supposed to control this when I don't even know what this is?
Valentina?
Do you know what the word "empathy" means?
Yeah, it's like if your friend feels bad, then you feel bad for them.
Close.
Empathy is directly experiencing the emotions of another person.
You, my child, are an empath.
Like being Mai and the Uniter wasn't enough?
Or more likely you have this gift because you are the Uniter.
Some of the very old legends claim that all Mai were once capable of this.
It's what bonded us to humans.
It's not surprising that you possess this quality.
You are the embodiment of all that is Mai.
So if I tried with you right now--
No, it was something that passed only between Mai and humans.
But it doesn't even work right.
I thought Lana was terrified and she was laughing.
And the delivery guy was maybe kind of annoyed, but he certainly wasn't out to kill anybody.
I know that you don't want to hear this, but perhaps you should limit your contact with humans.
What am I gonna do?
Ignore my family and friends?
I'm not saying forever.
Just until we have a better understanding.
( Gasps ) Ugh, my friends!
Do you know what time it is?
- Chloe.
- I've gotta go.
Enough bad things have happened today without adding one more to the list.
Go.
Oh!
Supersized sorry.
Mm-hmm.
So I guess cats can't read clocks.
Amy, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Did Jasmine tell you what's going on with the mind melding?
You already ate?
Yeah, that's usually what we do when we go out to dinner.
- Please don't be this way.
- And which way is that?
Is it possible to get back to the crazy superpower
- portion of our evening?
- (Chloe and Amy) No.
Look, I know I've been a little flaky lately, but you didn't really mean it when you said you might be in the market for a new best friend, did you?
Who told you that?
I can't believe you told her that.
No, it wasn't Paul.
I just heard it.
I'm sorry.
This hearing thing isn't quite under control yet.
What else have you been listening to?
Have you ever heard of invasion of privacy?
Amy, you're missing the point.
No, I get it.
And A:
Obviously I didn't really mean it.
And B:
Now I think I just might.
The Chloe I know would never do something like that or treat her friends this way.
I gotta go.
I told the dads I wouldn't be late.
Some sidekick.
She's my ride.
Meredith:
Hey, kiddo.
Sorry I'm late.
Crazy day.
How was dinner?
- I didn't actually make it.
- Really?
I thought Wednesdays were practically sacred.
Are you gonna get on my case now too?
No, I am too tired to get on anyone's case.
Sorry.
I just feel like...
( Sighs )
Do you ever have one of those days where you feel a little out of control?
Frequently.
- Wanna talk?
- Amy's pissed.
Angry.
Amy's mad at me for reasons only known to Amy.
Well, she's not used to waiting in line.
You've been spending all that time with your new friends.
And now you sound like her.
But it's not like she and Paul haven't been surgically joined at the hip.
Maybe you're just going through a little adjustment period.
I mean, as people grow up, sometimes-- do not finish that sentence.
She's my best friend.
Then I'm not quite sure what we're talking about.
You don't understand.
No, it doesn't seem like I do.
- Anything else bothering you?
- No.
Why?
It's just a sense.
But since you don't seem to be in the mood for spilling secrets or seeking motherly wisdom,
I'm gonna close up shop and go to bed.
But if you change your mind,
I will be open again in the morning.
- 'Night.
- 'Night.
( Sighs )
Look, I know I asked for help, but this is like 600 radio stations playing at once.
I'll never be able to do it.
- Pick something.
- I can't.
- Just do what I tell you.
- Highly suspicious.
Don't be.
Now close your eyes.
( Siren wailing ) ( Baby crying )
( Squeaking )
It's so loud.
- ( Cell phone ringing )
- Hello?
Alek:
Ignore it.
Listen to your breathing-- the air going in and out of your body.
Take your time.
The rest of the world doesn't matter.
There's only you and me.
( Exhales )
Can you hear the clock?
Top of the tower.
- Alek.
- You can do this.
( Faint ticking )
- I can hear it.
( Ticking louder )
There's a woman in the market haggling with a vendor.
All right, how about we do two for $50?
Alek:
Now make it all go away.
You are in charge of the world around you.
- I don't know.
- Listen to my heartbeat.
Just that... and nothing else.
( Heart beating, background noise fades )
Did it work?
Yeah, it um-- it worked.
Thanks.
- Hey.
Is Chloe around?
- Not yet.
Thought she was always here in the afternoon.
You and me both.
Well, could you just tell her that--
Poised and ready.
Never mind.
I'll just give her a call.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I had to stay late for this class thing.
Your guy just left two seconds ago.
- Brian?
- Chloe.
You and I need to talk.
What happened here yesterday?
- You heard about that?
- I heard about it and somehow he thinks I'm the one who put you up to it.
The delivery guy?
- Why would he think that?
- What delivery guy?
How many guys did you knock over in here?
- I'm talking about Jesse.
- You know him?
Wish I didn't, but yeah.
He's my ex.
I'm sorry.
He never said he knew you, and he had your wrong address, so I--
Wait.
You're the one who gave him my new address?
I was trying to help.
He's the reason I moved out in the first place.
I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
- Chloe, this is so screwed up.
He's never gonna leave me alone now.
He's the reason you're so scared, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
This is none of your business.
But I'm right, aren't I?
Seriously, I'm warning you.
Let it go.
Lana, you have to do something.
I can help.
You know what would help?
If you just grabbed your stuff and you got out.
- I'm being serious.
- So am I.
Chloe, you're fired.
It didn't actually make sense until that moment.
You seem almost excited you got fired.
No, don't you get it?
It means I was right.
What I felt about Lana was right.
It's still very weird, but it's not completely wrong.
Has to make you feel better.
Bo staff...
Nunchucks, iodine-- I think we're good to go.
Shouldn't I have something to fight with?
No.
Tonight's lesson:
Avoidance.
Sometimes the best way to take a blow is to not be there when it lands.
Okay, crazy teenage ninja girl, don't you ever get tired of hitting me with things?
All the time, but my mom tasked me with training you.
Hmm, what if I work "avoidance" into a sentence and act like I took a bamboo pole to the head the next time I see her?
Then can we skip?
And what do you wanna do instead?
Spoons are in the top drawer.
So Jesse must have called Lana that afternoon when I got that feeling off her.
That's why she was so upset.
And if he's going around town pretending to be a delivery guy to get her address-- total nutjob, right?
Mm-hmm.
- Mm.
- Mm, so good.
Hey, you said that the Mai are always watching me, you know, to make sure I'm safe.
Could I get a couple of them to watch Lana instead?
Chloe, Lana can take care of herself.
I'm more worried--
What?
I don't think my mom's been completely honest with you.
It wasn't just that one scarface creep.
The Order's back.
They're here in San Francisco.
They're here for you.
I just get worried.
And I appreciate it.
I know this isn't the life you were expecting.
( Cell phone chiming )
It's not all bad.
Is it bad if I have a little bit of each?
Not at all.
And I had to guess at what you might like.
You so didn't have to do this.
I know, but I wanted to apologize for being kind of rude the other day.
You weren't rude.
My head was just kind of somewhere else.
- Believe me, it's okay.
- No no, it's not.
We had that whole conversation about being friends, and which I'm fine with.
The truth is I actually don't have any friends here, which means that I don't really have anyone to talk to.
You can talk to me.
I know.
This is-- this is the reason I came home.
What's it to?
I think a safety deposit box, but I haven't been able to figure out where yet.
My mom supposedly was killed... in a mugging that went bad, but parts of it just never made sense to me.
I felt like my dad was never telling me the whole story.
But where'd you get the key?
It showed up at school about a month ago with a note on it--
"Do you really know what happened to your mother?"
At first I thought it was some sick joke, but then I realized I'm not really sure.
So now I'm here and I'm gonna stay until I figure it out.
I'm glad you told me.
Me too.
Feels good talking about it.
It's been bothering me for years.
I guess I kind of felt like I just had to do something about it.
I know the feeling.
( Siren chirping )
Lana!
Lana, are you okay?
- What are you doing here?
- Did you tell them about Jesse?
Why would I do that?
Lana, come on, he had to have done this.
I really just want him to go away.
- You have to tell the police.
- Tell them what?
That I think some guy who can't quite grasp the concept of "I never wanna see you again" broke in here?
Why, to teach me a lesson?
He may be a major-league jerk with some serious control issues,
- but he's not violent.
- What do you call this?
I don't know.
My boss is gonna kill me.
I was just hoping if I ignore him...
This is already embarrassing enough.
Please, let me deal with this on my own.
- Lana.
- I'm a big girl, Chloe.
I can handle myself.
What's going on?
Is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
- Lana...
- Her ex-boyfriend's terrorizing her.
I'm almost sure he's the one who broke into the store.
So you were totally right.
Was there ever any question?
I just have to figure out what to do.
Maybe you should call Alek and Jasmine.
I'm sure they can help you make it all better.
Amy, look, I'm sorry if--
No, I'm not gonna say it, 'cause I'm pretty much done apologizing.
You said that the Chloe you know would never do this or act this way.
Well, newsflash:
I'm not the same old Chloe.
We can pretend that I am, but we all know it's not true.
You've always been my best friend.
And if it's up to me, you always will be.
But you have to accept me as I am now, faults, claws and all.
If you can't, I get it.
Not happy, but I get it.
And the next time you get jealous of the time I spend with Alek and Jasmine, try and remember that I'm only doing it so I don't have to die again.
Hello again.
You know the police are, like, 2' away.
Call them.
I'd love to tell them how you assaulted me the other night
- for absolutely no reason.
- Stay away from her.
What happens between me and Lana is none of your business.
But if you don't back off,
I'll make sure that you're my business.
Don't be an idiot.
If he ever comes within 10' of you again, I will personally rip out his lungs.
How about you just keep him away from Lana?
Chloe, I know you've already been warned.
This isn't your fight.
You've gotta get your priorities straight.
I can't just walk away.
There's nothing else you can do.
Now please just go home.
- But Lana--
- You heard her.
She can take care of herself.
Stop watching me.
You know I can't do that.
Meredith:
Oh my God.
Chloe, why didn't you tell me all of this was going on?
I don't think I was completely sure until now.
Well, now that you know, you are gonna stay far far away from this whole situation.
- But, mom--
- No, I don't think you understand how dangerous a guy like this can be.
If Lana doesn't call the police, I will.
But what if that makes it worse?
Doing nothing seldom makes problems go away.
This is what's been bothering you, isn't it?
What?
I knew something was up with you.
I just-
- I didn't know what it was.
How did you know?
Face it, kid, we're bonded.
You feel bad or sad, I feel bad or sad, even if I don't know the reason.
I can't even help it.
I think that means you're empathic.
No, that means I'm your mother.
You know, you don't have to go through all this stuff alone.
We, you and me, are a team.
Thanks.
Go, team us.
Do you think Lana's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
I hope so.
And I know you wanna help, but right now it's up to Lana.
You've let her know you're there.
But it's her life.
She has to take control of it.
I don't know if it's always that easy.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Nothing.
Just hanging out, hoping to catch a glimpse of the old man.
I noticed mom's picture isn't out anymore.
Well, sometimes it's best not to live in the past.
It was hard seeing her smiling face staring up at me every day like nothing bad had ever happened.
I keep the one of the three of us-- that summer on the boat.
I keep that next to my bed.
It was a good trip.
Maybe we can do it again.
Finally catch that marlin.
It'd be good to get away together one of these days.
I'm glad you're home.
Thanks.
Me too.
( Phone rings )
Hey, Lana, me again.
The fifth message, but I'm worried.
So just call me, please?
- ( Phone chimes, beeps )
- Amy?
Before you say anything, you were right and I was wrong.
I was the one being a bad friend.
I was afraid of losing you.
- Amy--
- I was completely self-involved.
I wasn't even trying to see things from your point of view.
- Amy!
- What?
I need you.
Can you come over?
I'm outside in my car waiting for you to forgive me, dummy.
( Beeps )
( Tires screech )
You're the one who said you wanted to go fast to make sure we're not being followed.
I'm pretty sure we lost them.
Look, Amy, I know it's not the best time, but I am deeply-- and we can deeply make up and forgive each other after you make sure Lana's okay.
I just wanna check on her.
If you see him coming-- you're number one on my speed dial.
Now go.
( Glass shatters )
Lana:
I didn't tell you you could come here.
Jesse:
You don't have to tell me anything.
I can do what I want, and I want to talk to you.
I'm done talking about this.
Let's go.
- (Jesse) I'm not going anywhere.
( Glass shatters )
Lana!
Lana!
( Gasps )
I told you to stay out of this.
I told you to stay away from her.
I can see why Lana broke up with you.
Not only are you a sarcastic jerk, but you're kind of slow.
- Rawr!
- Uh!
Aw, see, normally I'd apologize, but I decided to stop doing that today.
It's time somebody taught you some manners.
Well, you sure as hell are not the one to do it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
You?
So much better.
Thank you.
I suppose this means I have to give you your job back.
That's supposed to be my job.
I should have been there, not her.
- No offense.
- None taken.
Well, there's only one problem.
- What's that?
- You don't have a car.
( Girls laughing )
Hey.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Just been here waiting for you.
Don't we have some training to do?
Amy:
And make sure you don't leave out any of the important stuff.
Chloe has to know how to protect herself.
Alek:
That's what we've been trying--
He doesn't have a car.
Let's go.
I'll call you later.
( Beeps )
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
He's very handsome.
Looks a lot like you.
You shouldn't leave guns lying around the house.
Very dangerous.
I just wanted you to know that if the girl is so much as touched... that I know where to find you and your son.
Get out of my house.
Remember, whether we see each other again is entirely up to you.

I knew I could make that jump.
I meant this afternoon with your friend.
That could have ended very differently.
- It was important to me.
- I understand.
Your human friends are important to you.
And I'd do it again.
You keep telling me to follow my instincts.
That's what I did.
I might not always understand them, but I have to learn to trust them.
I know I might not be the kind of Uniter you were hoping for, but this is the one you've got.
You're exactly the kind that we were hoping for.
Maybe it's time Mai and humans stopped living in different worlds.
It's not gonna be easy, Chloe.
So much hope and so much fear all in one girl.
Like it or not, the whole world is coming for you.
Then let it come.

Previously on "The Nine lives of Chloe King"...
Chloe:
That feeling I got when I first saw him in the church, it was like I was experiencing exactly what he was feeling.
This is the longest we've spent together since mom died.
What's that supposed to mean?
Dad, most fathers would be thrilled that their son actually wanted to spend time with them.
I like you a lot and I like being a around you.
If you need time, I'm in no hurry.
Something tells me we're going to be very good friends.
Alek!
Your mom, she's the leader of the Mai?
I'm sorry, Chloe, but your life is no longer your own.
( Panting )
Hey!
Wait up.
You're doing great.
Though I don't think an assassin would let you take a time out to catch your breath, at least none of the assassins I know.
And that's why we're training.
But you can't keep stopping to look for obstacles.
Assume they're going to be there and improvise.
Assume invisible obstacles.
Got it.
The Order won't tell you where the knives are gonna land.
That's why you're such a good teacher-- always bringing it back to a practical application.
Think she's ready?
- Ready for what?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna say yes, but there's only one way to find out.
Wait!
How come my opinion doesn't count for anything?
- And I'm thinking not.
- Chloe, you can do this.
I promise.
Back up and try again.
Stop acting like a little scaredy human.
But what if I am a little scaredy human?
No, you're Mai.
So stop thinking and start using your instinct.
I am, and my instincts are telling me that you people are crazy.
If Alek can do it, then I'm pretty sure you can.
Hey.
( Sighs ) Fine.
( Grunting )
It generally hurts less if you actually jump all the way across.
You didn't trust yourself.
Next time you might not be so lucky.
Not gonna be a next time.
Come on, we got a lot more work to do.

Morning.
Made your favorite-- cereal and bowl.
Some assembly required.
Oh excellent.
I was actually craving...
Unfrosted corn byproducts?
I thought I was supposed to enjoy my youth.
What happened to that box of sugary deliciousness?
Down your mother's gullet at 11:00 last night.
You're not the only one with cravings.
I think I'm gonna be late tonight.
It's okay.
It's Wednesday.
Ah, dinner with the dos amigos, yeah.
You going to Amy's this week?
I think burgers is the plan.
Already jealous.
Oh and, Chloe, what exactly were you doing last night?
( coughs )
I found your jeans on the bathroom floor with a huge hole in 'em.
Uh, you know me.
Wild child-- slinking down alleys, running across rooftops.
I tripped over the recycling bin coming in the side.
How many times have I told you that area-- the "are you okay?" Is implied as is the "I love you."
- Always is.
And I'm fine.
- Have a good day.
Ugh.
( Students laughing )
- (Girl) For sure!
- You have to promise.
You can't tell anyone.
Devon's parents were and we totally-- night,
- (girl #2) Really?
- (Girl #3) Sure did.
Yes, it's infected.
Yes, it hurt.
And yes, my mom's gonna kill me if she ever sees it.
Coach says a 4.9 won't even get college scouts interested.
Turn around.
Having fun?
I swear, I'm gonna tie a bell around your neck.
Stop sneaking up on me.
Maybe you would have heard if you weren't preoccupied.
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going to class.
And tuning into all the gossip?
So where do you think that tattoo actually is?
At least I think it's a tattoo she's talking about.
Ew!
And I wouldn't know.
It's just noise.
I can't really control it.
We'll have to work on that.
The hearing is there to alert you to danger.
- Meaning you?
- Meaning killers, executioners.
the assorted non-human predator.
You're not safe just because you stopped one man.
You have to learn to control your gifts.
It might mean between life and-- well, for you, losing another.
Is this your long-winded, slightly frightening way of saying that I have training again tonight?
- Jasmine will pick you up after work.
- Can't wait.
Has anyone ever told you that you're a close talker?
- Just you.
- It's not a compliment.
I'll see you later.
Oh and, Chloe, be careful.
One of these days something you won't like.
That's the third night in a row she's blown me off.
I seriously think I might be in the market for a new best friend.
- Hey, you.
- Hey.
You look industrious.
And before you think I'm getting all stalkery, this sidewalk happens between school and work-- you know, if I take the long way around the park and cut across Divisadero.
Oh yeah, no, you didn't have to do that.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Just in the middle of working on some stuff.
Organized is good.
Um, I texted you last night about that movie.
Blood, guts, flying limbs-
- I'm in.
I think I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
My dad-- let's just say he's being my dad-- and that's complex.
Rain checks happily accepted.
Well, I'd better go or I'm gonna be late.
And as of two minutes ago, I actually am late.
- See ya.
- See ya.
( Sighs )
Mr. Rezza, a moment of your time.
- My employer is very upset.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
The Order does not exist to serve your personal vendettas.
Perhaps if you had listened when I tried to warn you...
The Mai now know of the girl's existence.
Plans were in place, but now she's guarded and protected.
Your involvement is no longer required.
We will dispose of the girl.
Expecting a call?
More like hoping for one.
I told Brian that we could only be friends.
And I thought he was okay with it, but-- you were being sarcastic.
Glad you caught that.
Hey, my friend Jasmine's coming by a little before 6:00 and I was wondering--
If you could stay to the end of your shift for a change?
It's like you're a mind reader.
- ( Phone ringing )
- Vintage.
Lana.
Look, hold on one second.
- Paul.
- Hey.
You're coming tonight, right?
It's my turn to pick.
Of course.
I would never miss dinner with my two best friends.
So is everything okay, you know, between you and me?
Paul?
Okay, to be honest, I have been a little hurt.
While I understand there's an unfortunate recurring borderline racist narrative in the American comic book pantheon of Asians being portrayed as subservient geeks or simply one-dimensional kung-fu-kicking bad-asses,
- I am none of those things.
- What are you talking about?
Why haven't you asked me to be your sidekick?
- My what?
- Your sidekick.
Your sidekick, your loyal and trusted confidant.
You, my friend, are already all of those things.
- Really?
- Really.
Unless I ever see you in tights.
Then the deal's off.
- ( Laughs )
- This conversation's over.
( Beep )
- Chloe!
Whoops.
- ( Gasps )
- What's wrong?
I don't know.
For a second I just--
I felt completely terrified.
- She's not that scary.
- No.
It's like I was feeling what she was feeling.
She's the one who's terrified.
Lana:
I know, I know...
Uh, whatever that weird sense thing is you got going on...
- ( Laughing ) ...You might wanna get it adjusted.
But I don't even know what it is.
So you're saying you can read people's minds?
No, I can't tell what they're thinking.
I literally feel what they're feeling on an emotional level.
But I can't control it.
It just happens.
See, this is the part where you say, "Oh yeah, I get that all the time.
It's a Mai thing.
It's so not a big deal."
Sorry, I've never heard of anything like it.
Great, so my powers came with an extra scoop of freak.
That Chloe, always an overachiever.
Chloe, I really don't think it's anything to worry about.
But if it'll make you feel better, we can talk to my mom.
( Bell jingles )
Hey, either of you "Lana Jacobs"?
No, sorry.
She left about a half an hour ago.
I guess that's why the instructions say to be here by 4:00.
Do you need me to sign for something?
I wish you could, but they're cupcakes, and these things go stale pretty quick.
And there is a God.
They included her home address.
411 Arden.
She moved, like, two weeks ago.
I'll write it down for you.
Thanks, I really appreciate that.
I think she could use a little cheering up.
Here you go.
All right.
Have a good one.
- ( Chloe gasps ) - ( Grunts )
- What the hell?
- Chloe!
What's the matter with you?
I have no idea.
It's like I was possessed.
I mean the second he touched me.
I just felt this huge, giant wave of rage.
I just-
- I don't know how else to describe it.
That must have been so frightening.
For me and him.
I mean, he just kind of took off.
I wanted to go after him, but Jasmine--
Was right to bring you to me.
At this moment he's the least of your problems.
Something's wrong with me, Valentina.
Really wrong.
I think if Jasmine hadn't been there,
I-
- I might have tried to kill him.
And perhaps you would have.
So it's imperative that you learn to control this.
How am I supposed to control this when I don't even know what this is?
Valentina?
Do you know what the word "empathy" means?
Yeah, it's like if your friend feels bad, then you feel bad for them.
Close.
Empathy is directly experiencing the emotions of another person.
You, my child, are an empath.
Like being Mai and the Uniter wasn't enough?
Or more likely you have this gift because you are the Uniter.
Some of the very old legends claim that all Mai were once capable of this.
It's what bonded us to humans.
It's not surprising that you possess this quality.
You are the embodiment of all that is Mai.
So if I tried with you right now--
No, it was something that passed only between Mai and humans.
But it doesn't even work right.
I thought Lana was terrified and she was laughing.
And the delivery guy was maybe kind of annoyed, but he certainly wasn't out to kill anybody.
I know that you don't want to hear this, but perhaps you should limit your contact with humans.
What am I gonna do?
Ignore my family and friends?
I'm not saying forever.
Just until we have a better understanding.
( Gasps ) Ugh, my friends!
Do you know what time it is?
- Chloe.
- I've gotta go.
Enough bad things have happened today without adding one more to the list.
Go.
Oh!
Supersized sorry.
Mm-hmm.
So I guess cats can't read clocks.
Amy, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Did Jasmine tell you what's going on with the mind melding?
You already ate?
Yeah, that's usually what we do when we go out to dinner.
- Please don't be this way.
- And which way is that?
Is it possible to get back to the crazy superpower
- portion of our evening?
- (Chloe and Amy) No.
Look, I know I've been a little flaky lately, but you didn't really mean it when you said you might be in the market for a new best friend, did you?
Who told you that?
I can't believe you told her that.
No, it wasn't Paul.
I just heard it.
I'm sorry.
This hearing thing isn't quite under control yet.
What else have you been listening to?
Have you ever heard of invasion of privacy?
Amy, you're missing the point.
No, I get it.
And A:
Obviously I didn't really mean it.
And B:
Now I think I just might.
The Chloe I know would never do something like that or treat her friends this way.
I gotta go.
I told the dads I wouldn't be late.
Some sidekick.
She's my ride.
Meredith:
Hey, kiddo.
Sorry I'm late.
Crazy day.
How was dinner?
- I didn't actually make it.
- Really?
I thought Wednesdays were practically sacred.
Are you gonna get on my case now too?
No, I am too tired to get on anyone's case.
Sorry.
I just feel like...
( Sighs )
Do you ever have one of those days where you feel a little out of control?
Frequently.
- Wanna talk?
- Amy's pissed.
Angry.
Amy's mad at me for reasons only known to Amy.
Well, she's not used to waiting in line.
You've been spending all that time with your new friends.
And now you sound like her.
But it's not like she and Paul haven't been surgically joined at the hip.
Maybe you're just going through a little adjustment period.
I mean, as people grow up, sometimes-- do not finish that sentence.
She's my best friend.
Then I'm not quite sure what we're talking about.
You don't understand.
No, it doesn't seem like I do.
- Anything else bothering you?
- No.
Why?
It's just a sense.
But since you don't seem to be in the mood for spilling secrets or seeking motherly wisdom,
I'm gonna close up shop and go to bed.
But if you change your mind,
I will be open again in the morning.
- 'Night.
- 'Night.
( Sighs )
Look, I know I asked for help, but this is like 600 radio stations playing at once.
I'll never be able to do it.
- Pick something.
- I can't.
- Just do what I tell you.
- Highly suspicious.
Don't be.
Now close your eyes.
( Siren wailing ) ( Baby crying )
( Squeaking )
It's so loud.
- ( Cell phone ringing )
- Hello?
Alek:
Ignore it.
Listen to your breathing-- the air going in and out of your body.
Take your time.
The rest of the world doesn't matter.
There's only you and me.
( Exhales )
Can you hear the clock?
Top of the tower.
- Alek.
- You can do this.
( Faint ticking )
- I can hear it.
( Ticking louder )
There's a woman in the market haggling with a vendor.
All right, how about we do two for $50?
Alek:
Now make it all go away.
You are in charge of the world around you.
- I don't know.
- Listen to my heartbeat.
Just that... and nothing else.
( Heart beating, background noise fades )
Did it work?
Yeah, it um-- it worked.
Thanks.
- Hey.
Is Chloe around?
- Not yet.
Thought she was always here in the afternoon.
You and me both.
Well, could you just tell her that--
Poised and ready.
Never mind.
I'll just give her a call.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I had to stay late for this class thing.
Your guy just left two seconds ago.
- Brian?
- Chloe.
You and I need to talk.
What happened here yesterday?
- You heard about that?
- I heard about it and somehow he thinks I'm the one who put you up to it.
The delivery guy?
- Why would he think that?
- What delivery guy?
How many guys did you knock over in here?
- I'm talking about Jesse.
- You know him?
Wish I didn't, but yeah.
He's my ex.
I'm sorry.
He never said he knew you, and he had your wrong address, so I--
Wait.
You're the one who gave him my new address?
I was trying to help.
He's the reason I moved out in the first place.
I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
- Chloe, this is so screwed up.
He's never gonna leave me alone now.
He's the reason you're so scared, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
This is none of your business.
But I'm right, aren't I?
Seriously, I'm warning you.
Let it go.
Lana, you have to do something.
I can help.
You know what would help?
If you just grabbed your stuff and you got out.
- I'm being serious.
- So am I.
Chloe, you're fired.
It didn't actually make sense until that moment.
You seem almost excited you got fired.
No, don't you get it?
It means I was right.
What I felt about Lana was right.
It's still very weird, but it's not completely wrong.
Has to make you feel better.
Bo staff...
Nunchucks, iodine-- I think we're good to go.
Shouldn't I have something to fight with?
No.
Tonight's lesson:
Avoidance.
Sometimes the best way to take a blow is to not be there when it lands.
Okay, crazy teenage ninja girl, don't you ever get tired of hitting me with things?
All the time, but my mom tasked me with training you.
Hmm, what if I work "avoidance" into a sentence and act like I took a bamboo pole to the head the next time I see her?
Then can we skip?
And what do you wanna do instead?
Spoons are in the top drawer.
So Jesse must have called Lana that afternoon when I got that feeling off her.
That's why she was so upset.
And if he's going around town pretending to be a delivery guy to get her address-- total nutjob, right?
Mm-hmm.
- Mm.
- Mm, so good.
Hey, you said that the Mai are always watching me, you know, to make sure I'm safe.
Could I get a couple of them to watch Lana instead?
Chloe, Lana can take care of herself.
I'm more worried--
What?
I don't think my mom's been completely honest with you.
It wasn't just that one scarface creep.
The Order's back.
They're here in San Francisco.
They're here for you.
I just get worried.
And I appreciate it.
I know this isn't the life you were expecting.
( Cell phone chiming )
It's not all bad.
Is it bad if I have a little bit of each?
Not at all.
And I had to guess at what you might like.
You so didn't have to do this.
I know, but I wanted to apologize for being kind of rude the other day.
You weren't rude.
My head was just kind of somewhere else.
- Believe me, it's okay.
- No no, it's not.
We had that whole conversation about being friends, and which I'm fine with.
The truth is I actually don't have any friends here, which means that I don't really have anyone to talk to.
You can talk to me.
I know.
This is-- this is the reason I came home.
What's it to?
I think a safety deposit box, but I haven't been able to figure out where yet.
My mom supposedly was killed... in a mugging that went bad, but parts of it just never made sense to me.
I felt like my dad was never telling me the whole story.
But where'd you get the key?
It showed up at school about a month ago with a note on it--
"Do you really know what happened to your mother?"
At first I thought it was some sick joke, but then I realized I'm not really sure.
So now I'm here and I'm gonna stay until I figure it out.
I'm glad you told me.
Me too.
Feels good talking about it.
It's been bothering me for years.
I guess I kind of felt like I just had to do something about it.
I know the feeling.
( Siren chirping )
Lana!
Lana, are you okay?
- What are you doing here?
- Did you tell them about Jesse?
Why would I do that?
Lana, come on, he had to have done this.
I really just want him to go away.
- You have to tell the police.
- Tell them what?
That I think some guy who can't quite grasp the concept of "I never wanna see you again" broke in here?
Why, to teach me a lesson?
He may be a major-league jerk with some serious control issues,
- but he's not violent.
- What do you call this?
I don't know.
My boss is gonna kill me.
I was just hoping if I ignore him...
This is already embarrassing enough.
Please, let me deal with this on my own.
- Lana.
- I'm a big girl, Chloe.
I can handle myself.
What's going on?
Is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
- Lana...
- Her ex-boyfriend's terrorizing her.
I'm almost sure he's the one who broke into the store.
So you were totally right.
Was there ever any question?
I just have to figure out what to do.
Maybe you should call Alek and Jasmine.
I'm sure they can help you make it all better.
Amy, look, I'm sorry if--
No, I'm not gonna say it, 'cause I'm pretty much done apologizing.
You said that the Chloe you know would never do this or act this way.
Well, newsflash:
I'm not the same old Chloe.
We can pretend that I am, but we all know it's not true.
You've always been my best friend.
And if it's up to me, you always will be.
But you have to accept me as I am now, faults, claws and all.
If you can't, I get it.
Not happy, but I get it.
And the next time you get jealous of the time I spend with Alek and Jasmine, try and remember that I'm only doing it so I don't have to die again.
Hello again.
You know the police are, like, 2' away.
Call them.
I'd love to tell them how you assaulted me the other night
- for absolutely no reason.
- Stay away from her.
What happens between me and Lana is none of your business.
But if you don't back off,
I'll make sure that you're my business.
Don't be an idiot.
If he ever comes within 10' of you again, I will personally rip out his lungs.
How about you just keep him away from Lana?
Chloe, I know you've already been warned.
This isn't your fight.
You've gotta get your priorities straight.
I can't just walk away.
There's nothing else you can do.
Now please just go home.
- But Lana--
- You heard her.
She can take care of herself.
Stop watching me.
You know I can't do that.
Meredith:
Oh my God.
Chloe, why didn't you tell me all of this was going on?
I don't think I was completely sure until now.
Well, now that you know, you are gonna stay far far away from this whole situation.
- But, mom--
- No, I don't think you understand how dangerous a guy like this can be.
If Lana doesn't call the police, I will.
But what if that makes it worse?
Doing nothing seldom makes problems go away.
This is what's been bothering you, isn't it?
What?
I knew something was up with you.
I just-
- I didn't know what it was.
How did you know?
Face it, kid, we're bonded.
You feel bad or sad, I feel bad or sad, even if I don't know the reason.
I can't even help it.
I think that means you're empathic.
No, that means I'm your mother.
You know, you don't have to go through all this stuff alone.
We, you and me, are a team.
Thanks.
Go, team us.
Do you think Lana's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
I hope so.
And I know you wanna help, but right now it's up to Lana.
You've let her know you're there.
But it's her life.
She has to take control of it.
I don't know if it's always that easy.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Nothing.
Just hanging out, hoping to catch a glimpse of the old man.
I noticed mom's picture isn't out anymore.
Well, sometimes it's best not to live in the past.
It was hard seeing her smiling face staring up at me every day like nothing bad had ever happened.
I keep the one of the three of us-- that summer on the boat.
I keep that next to my bed.
It was a good trip.
Maybe we can do it again.
Finally catch that marlin.
It'd be good to get away together one of these days.
I'm glad you're home.
Thanks.
Me too.
( Phone rings )
Hey, Lana, me again.
The fifth message, but I'm worried.
So just call me, please?
- ( Phone chimes, beeps )
- Amy?
Before you say anything, you were right and I was wrong.
I was the one being a bad friend.
I was afraid of losing you.
- Amy--
- I was completely self-involved.
I wasn't even trying to see things from your point of view.
- Amy!
- What?
I need you.
Can you come over?
I'm outside in my car waiting for you to forgive me, dummy.
( Beeps )
( Tires screech )
You're the one who said you wanted to go fast to make sure we're not being followed.
I'm pretty sure we lost them.
Look, Amy, I know it's not the best time, but I am deeply-- and we can deeply make up and forgive each other after you make sure Lana's okay.
I just wanna check on her.
If you see him coming-- you're number one on my speed dial.
Now go.
( Glass shatters )
Lana:
I didn't tell you you could come here.
Jesse:
You don't have to tell me anything.
I can do what I want, and I want to talk to you.
I'm done talking about this.
Let's go.
- (Jesse) I'm not going anywhere.
( Glass shatters )
Lana!
Lana!
( Gasps )
I told you to stay out of this.
I told you to stay away from her.
I can see why Lana broke up with you.
Not only are you a sarcastic jerk, but you're kind of slow.
- Rawr!
- Uh!
Aw, see, normally I'd apologize, but I decided to stop doing that today.
It's time somebody taught you some manners.
Well, you sure as hell are not the one to do it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
You?
So much better.
Thank you.
I suppose this means I have to give you your job back.
That's supposed to be my job.
I should have been there, not her.
- No offense.
- None taken.
Well, there's only one problem.
- What's that?
- You don't have a car.
( Girls laughing )
Hey.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Just been here waiting for you.
Don't we have some training to do?
Amy:
And make sure you don't leave out any of the important stuff.
Chloe has to know how to protect herself.
Alek:
That's what we've been trying--
He doesn't have a car.
Let's go.
I'll call you later.
( Beeps )
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
He's very handsome.
Looks a lot like you.
You shouldn't leave guns lying around the house.
Very dangerous.
I just wanted you to know that if the girl is so much as touched... that I know where to find you and your son.
Get out of my house.
Remember, whether we see each other again is entirely up to you.

I knew I could make that jump.
I meant this afternoon with your friend.
That could have ended very differently.
- It was important to me.
- I understand.
Your human friends are important to you.
And I'd do it again.
You keep telling me to follow my instincts.
That's what I did.
I might not always understand them, but I have to learn to trust them.
I know I might not be the kind of Uniter you were hoping for, but this is the one you've got.
You're exactly the kind that we were hoping for.
Maybe it's time Mai and humans stopped living in different worlds.
It's not gonna be easy, Chloe.
So much hope and so much fear all in one girl.
Like it or not, the whole world is coming for you.
Then let it come.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Previously on "The Nine lives of Chloe King"...
That feeling I got when I first saw him in the church, it was like I was experiencing exactly what he was feeling.
This is the longest we've spent together since mom died.
What's that supposed to mean?
Dad, most fathers would be thrilled that their son actually wanted to spend time with them.
I like you a lot and I like being a around you.
If you need time, I'm in no hurry.
Something tells me we're going to be very good friends.
Alek!
Your mom, she's the leader of the Mai?
I'm sorry, Chloe, but your life is no longer your own.
Hey!
Wait up.
You're doing great.
Though I don't think an assassin would let you take a time out to catch your breath, at least none of the assassins I know.
And that's why we're training.
But you can't keep stopping to look for obstacles.
Assume they're going to be there and improvise.
Assume invisible obstacles.
Got it.
The Order won't tell you where the knives are gonna land.
That's why you're such a good teacher-- always bringing it back to a practical application.
Think she's ready?
- Ready for what?
- I don't know.
I'm gonna say yes, but there's only one way to find out.
Wait!
How come my opinion doesn't count for anything?
- And I'm thinking not.
- Chloe, you can do this.
I promise.
Back up and try again.
Stop acting like a little scaredy human.
But what if I am a little scaredy human?
No, you're Mai.
So stop thinking and start using your instinct.
I am, and my instincts are telling me that you people are crazy.
If Alek can do it, then I'm pretty sure you can.
Hey.
Fine.
It generally hurts less if you actually jump all the way across.
You didn't trust yourself.
Next time you might not be so lucky.
Not gonna be a next time.
Come on, we got a lot more work to do.

Morning.
Made your favorite-- cereal and bowl.
Some assembly required.
Oh excellent.
I was actually craving...
Unfrosted corn byproducts?
I thought I was supposed to enjoy my youth.
What happened to that box of sugary deliciousness?
Down your mother's gullet at 11:00 last night.
You're not the only one with cravings.
I think I'm gonna be late tonight.
It's okay.
It's Wednesday.
Ah, dinner with the dos amigos, yeah.
You going to Amy's this week?
I think burgers is the plan.
Already jealous.
Oh and, Chloe, what exactly were you doing last night?
I found your jeans on the bathroom floor with a huge hole in 'em.
Uh, you know me.
Wild child-- slinking down alleys, running across rooftops.
I tripped over the recycling bin coming in the side.
How many times have I told you that area-- the "are you okay?" Is implied as is the "I love you."
- Always is.
And I'm fine.
- Have a good day.
Ugh.
- For sure!
- You have to promise.
You can't tell anyone.
Devon's parents were and we totally-- night,
- Really?
- Sure did.
Yes, it's infected.
Yes, it hurt.
And yes, my mom's gonna kill me if she ever sees it.
Coach says a 4.9 won't even get college scouts interested.
Turn around.
Having fun?
I swear, I'm gonna tie a bell around your neck.
Stop sneaking up on me.
Maybe you would have heard if you weren't preoccupied.
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going to class.
And tuning into all the gossip?
So where do you think that tattoo actually is?
At least I think it's a tattoo she's talking about.
Ew!
And I wouldn't know.
It's just noise.
I can't really control it.
We'll have to work on that.
The hearing is there to alert you to danger.
- Meaning you?
- Meaning killers, executioners.
the assorted non-human predator.
You're not safe just because you stopped one man.
You have to learn to control your gifts.
It might mean between life and-- well, for you, losing another.
Is this your long-winded, slightly frightening way of saying that I have training again tonight?
- Jasmine will pick you up after work.
- Can't wait.
Has anyone ever told you that you're a close talker?
- Just you.
- It's not a compliment.
I'll see you later.
Oh and, Chloe, be careful.
One of these days something you won't like.
That's the third night in a row she's blown me off.
I seriously think I might be in the market for a new best friend.
- Hey, you.
- Hey.
You look industrious.
And before you think I'm getting all stalkery, this sidewalk happens between school and work-- you know, if I take the long way around the park and cut across Divisadero.
Oh yeah, no, you didn't have to do that.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Just in the middle of working on some stuff.
Organized is good.
Um, I texted you last night about that movie.
Blood, guts, flying limbs-
- I'm in.
I think I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
My dad-- let's just say he's being my dad-- and that's complex.
Rain checks happily accepted.
Well, I'd better go or I'm gonna be late.
And as of two minutes ago, I actually am late.
- See ya.
- See ya.
Mr. Rezza, a moment of your time.
- My employer is very upset.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
The Order does not exist to serve your personal vendettas.
Perhaps if you had listened when I tried to warn you...
The Mai now know of the girl's existence.
Plans were in place, but now she's guarded and protected.
Your involvement is no longer required.
We will dispose of the girl.
Expecting a call?
More like hoping for one.
I told Brian that we could only be friends.
And I thought he was okay with it, but-- you were being sarcastic.
Glad you caught that.
Hey, my friend Jasmine's coming by a little before 6:00 and I was wondering--
If you could stay to the end of your shift for a change?
It's like you're a mind reader.
Vintage.
Lana.
Look, hold on one second.
- Paul.
- Hey.
You're coming tonight, right?
It's my turn to pick.
Of course.
I would never miss dinner with my two best friends.
So is everything okay, you know, between you and me?
Paul?
Okay, to be honest, I have been a little hurt.
While I understand there's an unfortunate recurring borderline racist narrative in the American comic book pantheon of Asians being portrayed as subservient geeks or simply one-dimensional kung-fu-kicking bad-asses,
- I am none of those things.
- What are you talking about?
Why haven't you asked me to be your sidekick?
- My what?
- Your sidekick.
Your sidekick, your loyal and trusted confidant.
You, my friend, are already all of those things.
- Really?
- Really.
Unless I ever see you in tights.
Then the deal's off.
This conversation's over.
Chloe!
Whoops.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
For a second I just--
I felt completely terrified.
- She's not that scary.
- No.
It's like I was feeling what she was feeling.
She's the one who's terrified.
I know, I know...
Uh, whatever that weird sense thing is you got going on You might wanna get it adjusted.
But I don't even know what it is.
So you're saying you can read people's minds?
No, I can't tell what they're thinking.
I literally feel what they're feeling on an emotional level.
But I can't control it.
It just happens.
See, this is the part where you say, "Oh yeah, I get that all the time.
It's a Mai thing.
It's so not a big deal."
Sorry, I've never heard of anything like it.
Great, so my powers came with an extra scoop of freak.
That Chloe, always an overachiever.
Chloe, I really don't think it's anything to worry about.
But if it'll make you feel better, we can talk to my mom.
Hey, either of you "Lana Jacobs"?
No, sorry.
She left about a half an hour ago.
I guess that's why the instructions say to be here by 4:00.
Do you need me to sign for something?
I wish you could, but they're cupcakes, and these things go stale pretty quick.
And there is a God.
They included her home address.
411 Arden.
She moved, like, two weeks ago.
I'll write it down for you.
Thanks, I really appreciate that.
I think she could use a little cheering up.
Here you go.
All right.
Have a good one.
- What the hell?
- Chloe!
What's the matter with you?
I have no idea.
It's like I was possessed.
I mean the second he touched me.
I just felt this huge, giant wave of rage.
I just-
- I don't know how else to describe it.
That must have been so frightening.
For me and him.
I mean, he just kind of took off.
I wanted to go after him, but Jasmine--
Was right to bring you to me.
At this moment he's the least of your problems.
Something's wrong with me, Valentina.
Really wrong.
I think if Jasmine hadn't been there,
I-
- I might have tried to kill him.
And perhaps you would have.
So it's imperative that you learn to control this.
How am I supposed to control this when I don't even know what this is?
Valentina?
Do you know what the word "empathy" means?
Yeah, it's like if your friend feels bad, then you feel bad for them.
Close.
Empathy is directly experiencing the emotions of another person.
You, my child, are an empath.
Like being Mai and the Uniter wasn't enough?
Or more likely you have this gift because you are the Uniter.
Some of the very old legends claim that all Mai were once capable of this.
It's what bonded us to humans.
It's not surprising that you possess this quality.
You are the embodiment of all that is Mai.
So if I tried with you right now--
No, it was something that passed only between Mai and humans.
But it doesn't even work right.
I thought Lana was terrified and she was laughing.
And the delivery guy was maybe kind of annoyed, but he certainly wasn't out to kill anybody.
I know that you don't want to hear this, but perhaps you should limit your contact with humans.
What am I gonna do?
Ignore my family and friends?
I'm not saying forever.
Just until we have a better understanding.
Ugh, my friends!
Do you know what time it is?
- Chloe.
- I've gotta go.
Enough bad things have happened today without adding one more to the list.
Go.
Oh!
Supersized sorry.
Mm-hmm.
So I guess cats can't read clocks.
Amy, you're not gonna believe what happened.
Did Jasmine tell you what's going on with the mind melding?
You already ate?
Yeah, that's usually what we do when we go out to dinner.
- Please don't be this way.
- And which way is that?
Is it possible to get back to the crazy superpower
- portion of our evening?
- No.
Look, I know I've been a little flaky lately, but you didn't really mean it when you said you might be in the market for a new best friend, did you?
Who told you that?
I can't believe you told her that.
No, it wasn't Paul.
I just heard it.
I'm sorry.
This hearing thing isn't quite under control yet.
What else have you been listening to?
Have you ever heard of invasion of privacy?
Amy, you're missing the point.
No, I get it.
And A:
Obviously I didn't really mean it.
And B:
Now I think I just might.
The Chloe I know would never do something like that or treat her friends this way.
I gotta go.
I told the dads I wouldn't be late.
Some sidekick.
She's my ride.
Hey, kiddo.
Sorry I'm late.
Crazy day.
How was dinner?
- I didn't actually make it.
- Really?
I thought Wednesdays were practically sacred.
Are you gonna get on my case now too?
No, I am too tired to get on anyone's case.
Sorry.
I just feel like...
Do you ever have one of those days where you feel a little out of control?
Frequently.
- Wanna talk?
- Amy's pissed.
Angry.
Amy's mad at me for reasons only known to Amy.
Well, she's not used to waiting in line.
You've been spending all that time with your new friends.
And now you sound like her.
But it's not like she and Paul haven't been surgically joined at the hip.
Maybe you're just going through a little adjustment period.
I mean, as people grow up, sometimes-- do not finish that sentence.
She's my best friend.
Then I'm not quite sure what we're talking about.
You don't understand.
No, it doesn't seem like I do.
- Anything else bothering you?
- No.
Why?
It's just a sense.
But since you don't seem to be in the mood for spilling secrets or seeking motherly wisdom,
I'm gonna close up shop and go to bed.
But if you change your mind,
I will be open again in the morning.
- 'Night.
- 'Night.
Look, I know I asked for help, but this is like 600 radio stations playing at once.
I'll never be able to do it.
- Pick something.
- I can't.
- Just do what I tell you.
- Highly suspicious.
Don't be.
Now close your eyes.
It's so loud.
Hello?
Ignore it.
Listen to your breathing-- the air going in and out of your body.
Take your time.
The rest of the world doesn't matter.
There's only you and me.
Can you hear the clock?
Top of the tower.
- Alek.
- You can do this.
I can hear it.
There's a woman in the market haggling with a vendor.
All right, how about we do two for $50?
Now make it all go away.
You are in charge of the world around you.
- I don't know.
- Listen to my heartbeat.
Just that... and nothing else.
Did it work?
Yeah, it um-- it worked.
Thanks.
- Hey.
Is Chloe around?
- Not yet.
Thought she was always here in the afternoon.
You and me both.
Well, could you just tell her that--
Poised and ready.
Never mind.
I'll just give her a call.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I had to stay late for this class thing.
Your guy just left two seconds ago.
- Brian?
- Chloe.
You and I need to talk.
What happened here yesterday?
- You heard about that?
- I heard about it and somehow he thinks I'm the one who put you up to it.
The delivery guy?
- Why would he think that?
- What delivery guy?
How many guys did you knock over in here?
- I'm talking about Jesse.
- You know him?
Wish I didn't, but yeah.
He's my ex.
I'm sorry.
He never said he knew you, and he had your wrong address, so I--
Wait.
You're the one who gave him my new address?
I was trying to help.
He's the reason I moved out in the first place.
I'm sorry.
- I didn't know.
- Chloe, this is so screwed up.
He's never gonna leave me alone now.
He's the reason you're so scared, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
This is none of your business.
But I'm right, aren't I?
Seriously, I'm warning you.
Let it go.
Lana, you have to do something.
I can help.
You know what would help?
If you just grabbed your stuff and you got out.
- I'm being serious.
- So am I.
Chloe, you're fired.
It didn't actually make sense until that moment.
You seem almost excited you got fired.
No, don't you get it?
It means I was right.
What I felt about Lana was right.
It's still very weird, but it's not completely wrong.
Has to make you feel better.
Bo staff...
Nunchucks, iodine-- I think we're good to go.
Shouldn't I have something to fight with?
No.
Tonight's lesson:
Avoidance.
Sometimes the best way to take a blow is to not be there when it lands.
Okay, crazy teenage ninja girl, don't you ever get tired of hitting me with things?
All the time, but my mom tasked me with training you.
Hmm, what if I work "avoidance" into a sentence and act like I took a bamboo pole to the head the next time I see her?
Then can we skip?
And what do you wanna do instead?
Spoons are in the top drawer.
So Jesse must have called Lana that afternoon when I got that feeling off her.
That's why she was so upset.
And if he's going around town pretending to be a delivery guy to get her address-- total nutjob, right?
Mm-hmm.
- Mm.
- Mm, so good.
Hey, you said that the Mai are always watching me, you know, to make sure I'm safe.
Could I get a couple of them to watch Lana instead?
Chloe, Lana can take care of herself.
I'm more worried--
What?
I don't think my mom's been completely honest with you.
It wasn't just that one scarface creep.
The Order's back.
They're here in San Francisco.
They're here for you.
I just get worried.
And I appreciate it.
I know this isn't the life you were expecting.
It's not all bad.
Is it bad if I have a little bit of each?
Not at all.
And I had to guess at what you might like.
You so didn't have to do this.
I know, but I wanted to apologize for being kind of rude the other day.
You weren't rude.
My head was just kind of somewhere else.
- Believe me, it's okay.
- No no, it's not.
We had that whole conversation about being friends, and which I'm fine with.
The truth is I actually don't have any friends here, which means that I don't really have anyone to talk to.
You can talk to me.
I know.
This is-- this is the reason I came home.
What's it to?
I think a safety deposit box, but I haven't been able to figure out where yet.
My mom supposedly was killed... in a mugging that went bad, but parts of it just never made sense to me.
I felt like my dad was never telling me the whole story.
But where'd you get the key?
It showed up at school about a month ago with a note on it--
"Do you really know what happened to your mother?"
At first I thought it was some sick joke, but then I realized I'm not really sure.
So now I'm here and I'm gonna stay until I figure it out.
I'm glad you told me.
Me too.
Feels good talking about it.
It's been bothering me for years.
I guess I kind of felt like I just had to do something about it.
I know the feeling.
Lana!
Lana, are you okay?
- What are you doing here?
- Did you tell them about Jesse?
Why would I do that?
Lana, come on, he had to have done this.
I really just want him to go away.
- You have to tell the police.
- Tell them what?
That I think some guy who can't quite grasp the concept of "I never wanna see you again" broke in here?
Why, to teach me a lesson?
He may be a major-league jerk with some serious control issues,
- but he's not violent.
- What do you call this?
I don't know.
My boss is gonna kill me.
I was just hoping if I ignore him...
This is already embarrassing enough.
Please, let me deal with this on my own.
- Lana.
- I'm a big girl, Chloe.
I can handle myself.
What's going on?
Is everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
- Lana...
- Her ex-boyfriend's terrorizing her.
I'm almost sure he's the one who broke into the store.
So you were totally right.
Was there ever any question?
I just have to figure out what to do.
Maybe you should call Alek and Jasmine.
I'm sure they can help you make it all better.
Amy, look, I'm sorry if--
No, I'm not gonna say it, 'cause I'm pretty much done apologizing.
You said that the Chloe you know would never do this or act this way.
Well, newsflash:
I'm not the same old Chloe.
We can pretend that I am, but we all know it's not true.
You've always been my best friend.
And if it's up to me, you always will be.
But you have to accept me as I am now, faults, claws and all.
If you can't, I get it.
Not happy, but I get it.
And the next time you get jealous of the time I spend with Alek and Jasmine, try and remember that I'm only doing it so I don't have to die again.
Hello again.
You know the police are, like, 2' away.
Call them.
I'd love to tell them how you assaulted me the other night
- for absolutely no reason.
- Stay away from her.
What happens between me and Lana is none of your business.
But if you don't back off,
I'll make sure that you're my business.
Don't be an idiot.
If he ever comes within 10' of you again, I will personally rip out his lungs.
How about you just keep him away from Lana?
Chloe, I know you've already been warned.
This isn't your fight.
You've gotta get your priorities straight.
I can't just walk away.
There's nothing else you can do.
Now please just go home.
- But Lana--
- You heard her.
She can take care of herself.
Stop watching me.
You know I can't do that.
Oh my God.
Chloe, why didn't you tell me all of this was going on?
I don't think I was completely sure until now.
Well, now that you know, you are gonna stay far far away from this whole situation.
- But, mom--
- No, I don't think you understand how dangerous a guy like this can be.
If Lana doesn't call the police, I will.
But what if that makes it worse?
Doing nothing seldom makes problems go away.
This is what's been bothering you, isn't it?
What?
I knew something was up with you.
I just-
- I didn't know what it was.
How did you know?
Face it, kid, we're bonded.
You feel bad or sad, I feel bad or sad, even if I don't know the reason.
I can't even help it.
I think that means you're empathic.
No, that means I'm your mother.
You know, you don't have to go through all this stuff alone.
We, you and me, are a team.
Thanks.
Go, team us.
Do you think Lana's gonna be okay?
I honestly don't know.
I hope so.
And I know you wanna help, but right now it's up to Lana.
You've let her know you're there.
But it's her life.
She has to take control of it.
I don't know if it's always that easy.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Nothing.
Just hanging out, hoping to catch a glimpse of the old man.
I noticed mom's picture isn't out anymore.
Well, sometimes it's best not to live in the past.
It was hard seeing her smiling face staring up at me every day like nothing bad had ever happened.
I keep the one of the three of us-- that summer on the boat.
I keep that next to my bed.
It was a good trip.
Maybe we can do it again.
Finally catch that marlin.
It'd be good to get away together one of these days.
I'm glad you're home.
Thanks.
Me too.
Hey, Lana, me again.
The fifth message, but I'm worried.
So just call me, please?
Amy?
Before you say anything, you were right and I was wrong.
I was the one being a bad friend.
I was afraid of losing you.
- Amy--
- I was completely self-involved.
I wasn't even trying to see things from your point of view.
- Amy!
- What?
I need you.
Can you come over?
I'm outside in my car waiting for you to forgive me, dummy.
You're the one who said you wanted to go fast to make sure we're not being followed.
I'm pretty sure we lost them.
Look, Amy, I know it's not the best time, but I am deeply-- and we can deeply make up and forgive each other after you make sure Lana's okay.
I just wanna check on her.
If you see him coming-- you're number one on my speed dial.
Now go.
I didn't tell you you could come here.
You don't have to tell me anything.
I can do what I want, and I want to talk to you.
I'm done talking about this.
Let's go.
I'm not going anywhere.
Lana!
Lana!
I told you to stay out of this.
I told you to stay away from her.
I can see why Lana broke up with you.
Not only are you a sarcastic jerk, but you're kind of slow.
- Rawr!
- Uh!
Aw, see, normally I'd apologize, but I decided to stop doing that today.
It's time somebody taught you some manners.
Well, you sure as hell are not the one to do it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
You?
So much better.
Thank you.
I suppose this means I have to give you your job back.
That's supposed to be my job.
I should have been there, not her.
- No offense.
- None taken.
Well, there's only one problem.
- What's that?
- You don't have a car.
Hey.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
Just been here waiting for you.
Don't we have some training to do?
And make sure you don't leave out any of the important stuff.
Chloe has to know how to protect herself.
That's what we've been trying--
He doesn't have a car.
Let's go.
I'll call you later.
Who the hell are you?
How did you get in here?
He's very handsome.
Looks a lot like you.
You shouldn't leave guns lying around the house.
Very dangerous.
I just wanted you to know that if the girl is so much as touched... that I know where to find you and your son.
Get out of my house.
Remember, whether we see each other again is entirely up to you.

I knew I could make that jump.
I meant this afternoon with your friend.
That could have ended very differently.
- It was important to me.
- I understand.
Your human friends are important to you.
And I'd do it again.
You keep telling me to follow my instincts.
That's what I did.
I might not always understand them, but I have to learn to trust them.
I know I might not be the kind of Uniter you were hoping for, but this is the one you've got.
You're exactly the kind that we were hoping for.
Maybe it's time Mai and humans stopped living in different worlds.
It's not gonna be easy, Chloe.
So much hope and so much fear all in one girl.
Like it or not, the whole world is coming for you.
Then let it come.

You know what a secret is?
It's a commodity.
It's leverage, control.
The old man's secret?
That jerkoff still jerks off to his ex-wife.
Would one you stupid cock jerkys answer the fucking phone?
Why should I answer the phone?
I'm the assistant office manger, not some secretary!
Meghan's secret is obvious.
She's a hermaphrodite who bought her son on the black market.
At least that's what I'm telling everyone.
Clinically brain-dead.
Support our troops.
I don't even want to guess what his deal is.
Fitzpatrick Motors.
How may I direct your call?
But I'll bet it involves a storage locker, illegal immigrants and a branding iron.
Richard, line two!
My secret?
Don't have any.
I live my life like an open book.
Fitz here.
Straight up.
No bullshit.
Richard Fitzpatrick is an honest man, making an honest buck.
Sure, I can show you where Dexter Laine died.
Fifty bucks.
For 100 bucks, I can show you photos of the chick who blew him to death.
And Dot Foxley's secret?
Hey, this is a private call.
None.
It's obvious she wants me.

I'm not going to let you turn Fitzpatrick Motors into a morbid roadside attraction.
I wouldn't have to if you hadn't stuck your nose and your mouth where it didn't belong.
You killed my meal ticket, lady.
I didn't kill him.
It was the vodka and Alzheimer's meds.
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
Hey, Dex Laine was my idol.
Most people would show me a little sympathy in light of his recent passing.
Or they would cut me a little slack.
Or they would take off my slacks, which goes back to showing a little sympathy.
Whatever little scam you're trying to pull,
I will stop you.
She has all but admitted it.
She is out to get you.
I thought we agreed she wasn't the shadowy figure.
Well, based on recent events, she is once again my prime suspect.
Jesus, Encyclopedia Brown Nose, it's obvious she was just trying to make me jealous.
Hm, or murder you on the Beaver Moon.
You know what?
Fuck the Beaver Moon, fuck the prophecy and fuck the shadowy figure.
What I need is money, land and the Summer Wind Lounge.
Got it?
No.
What you need is to identify your mystery nemesis.
Otherwise there won't be a Summer Wind Lounge, because there won't be a Richard Fitzpatrick.
This from the guy who turned my last piece of property into a toxic wasteland?
That was you.
Let's not play the blame game here, okay?
Let's get out there and earn!
Come on!
Sounds like you got a plan.
Damn, he's got a plan.
How does a deceased man sign his own souvenir shirt?
The autographed one should go for 50, easy.
But if you shut up, I can get you one for the low, low price of 40... 49... 49.99.
Plus 10%.
Start signing.
The crowds will be here soon.
The crowds?
Yeah.
I posted a message on the Dexter Laine website, and the fans are going ape shit.
Richard, this isn't honouring a legend.
It's unscrupulous exploitation of a man's death.
I'm wearing a tuxedo.
What is--?
Okay, clearly, you're exhibiting signs of textbook denial.
Hey, hey, that's your very first stage of grief, an emotional milestone.
I am not denying.
I am cashing in.
And, frankly, Dex Laine would be offended if I didn't take advantage of his death.
When was the last time I wore this tux?
Go, Fitz.
No, no, no.
Fitz!
Fitz!
Richard, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Hey, what did that stir stick remind you of?
What does it mean?
It means there's a drink somewhere that needs to get stirred.
Fuck off.
Yeah, I thought that Uncle D died on the bus.
Ah, creative licence.
Oh, we should splash some fake blood around.
Make it look more gory.
People love that shit.
Yeah, yeah, hey, I can't get the real stuff, you know?
I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a--
Look, Fitz, I need to talk to you about something.
You can't talk and work at the same time?
The tension's still there, you know?
Between you and me, a dude can get jealous when his best friend gets a girlfriend, but I don't want what Dot and I have to come in between us.
She's not your girlfriend, Josh.
Fitzy, buddy, don't be like this.
Dot's blown every guy at the fucking dealership.
Except for Larry, but he doesn't have a dick and me, which is a mystery that will rival Stonehenge for what the fuck is up with that?
Hey, you know what?
What Dot and I have is honest and true and pure and honest.
Like that fairytale in the swamp with the guy.
Remember, with the--?
You know what?
I'm not talking.
For two days.
Fucking stoner.
Step right up.
See where legendary crooner Dexter Laine died.
- Get a real job!
- It's incredibly sad.
Where the hell is everybody?
Well, most of Uncle D's fans are elderly, Richard.
It's going to take them days just to get out of bed.
Well, you better step your game up.
I need lines around the block, reservations.
I need a waiting list before fucking Dot shuts this shit down.
Right on track.
You're shifting from denial to anger.
Rarr!
Ahem.
How much for the VIP tour?
I'm Richard Fitzpatrick.
Right this way.
Cash in advance.
Richard, please, I'm begging-
- He's got a gun.
Of course he does.
He's German.
Bavarian.
Right this way.
Got a gun.
This is remarkable shrine you've erected in Uncle D's honour.
I consider it a public service.
Make sure you tell all your friends.
Ah, so cool.
I understand you were with Uncle D when he expired, yeah?
It was natural causes.
You misunderstand me, Herr Fitzpatrick.
I seek only to know more about the condition of the death.
Tell me, was it tragic?
It was very tragic, like an opera.
His feet--?
Were they freshly bathed?
He showered compulsively.
What about shoes?
Was he wearing shoes?
Sandals perhaps?
No, slippers.
Oh, slippers.
Yeah, this is good.
Now, were the toenails--?
Were they neatly trimmed or was Uncle D careless in his maintenance?
What about the hair?
Were they hairy?
You like feet, do you?
Do not judge me!
Whoa, take it easy Baron von Pervy.
I'm a breast man.
You're a foot man.
A dead-foot man.
Really?
A necro-podiphiliac?
That is seriously fucked up.
Not nearly as fucked up as what I would do with those feet if I could have just one night with them.
And if I could facilitate this night of passion, what would you be willing to pay for it?
A lot.
Oh, Richard, t-this is bad.
How can you be so calm?
We could get caught at any second.
Hardly.
The security guard's a drunk.
We have plenty of time, as long as you don't fuck around.
There he is.
You know, cutting off a dead man's feet is not a healthy way to mourn your idol, Richard.
You know what else isn't healthy, Larry?
Ignoring debts to Lebanese mobsters.
If they don't get Summer Wind sanitation money,
I won't make it to the next Beaver Moon.
Yeah, but maybe if we just explain what happened and--
I'll give you 1,000 bucks right now to shut the fuck up.
Good for you.
Stage three, bargaining.
Hold on.
What is that?
There, on his neck.
And that?
Richard, what is--?
What is--?
What is that?
Oh, for fuck's sake.
That's a penis, Larry.
That's what men have.
No, no, I mean that mark.
Right there, look.
Well, that's a hickey given by a woman with braces.
Huh?
What, you think I wouldn't recognize the sweet, sweet scarring that can only come from a woman's mouth?
I've seen that mark before, Richard.
It's like the train-track scar on your backside.
Wait, wait!
Train tracks!
Richard, what are the signs the fortune-teller warned you about?
Remember?
Jesus, Ansel Asshole.
I don't have time for this shit.
We are here for one reason only, payola for Uncle D's admittedly attractive feet.
Now give me that.
No, ow.
Stop.
Give me that.
Give me that.
Yeah!
Really?
Let me see that mark.
Fine, make it fast.
I knew it!
A perfect match!
Thank you, Uncle D.
Your death has given Richard a chance at life!
If we know Uncle D nailed Dot, do you think I did too?
Yes, yes, and now we can right the wrongs you perpetrated against her and save our lives.
Even better, that means I drilled her precious wetland before anyone else at the dealership.
Suck on that, Josh!
I will never take your sloppy seconds!
Yeah!
I suppose that is a victory as well!
Yeah!
Fuck off, Larry.
Now, where did I leave that bone saw?
Okay, just-- If we could maybe--
I got it.
I got it.
Hurry up, will you?
Richard, you know what?
Maybe-
- Maybe your dream isn't a dream at all but a memory.
Yeah, what if your subconscious has been trying to warn you about Dot this whole time?
You've said some dumbass things since I've know you, Larry, but that was the dumbest-assiest.
Now get on with it!
Okay, yeah, no problem.
Just--
But what does this remind you of?
That's that stupid swizzle stick from some hotel.
Unh-unh, no, I saw how you reacted when you pulled this out of your pocket.
It frightened you.
Now, Richard, you tell me what you see in that nightmare, everything.
Well, there's me on this wheel of death, a shadowy figure with a knife, a whole lot of talented babes dying to take a ride on the SS Fitz, the hotel and--
Wait a minute.
Fried chicken and a Bellini.
It's no wonder I can't remember anything.
Hm, what is a Bellini?
It's Fitzy kryptonite.
It's made from peach schnapps.
It's my blackout booze.
Game fucking over.
I'll never remember what happened.
Hm, okay.
Okay, yes, I got this, buddy.
Maybe you decided to run away and join an all-female circus, because you fell in love with a knife thrower.
Yeah, and then that night you stopped at a hotel for some fried chicken and a Bellini!
I stand corrected, Larry.
That is the dumbest-assiest thing you've ever said.
Really?
Sir, no this is not what it looks like.
Richard, please, tell the man it's not what it looks like.
Did Josh send you for that blood?
You want to make five large?
I'm going to go wait in the car.
Gun!
Danke.
Another satisfied customer.
I still can't believe you paid that man to amputate Dexter Laine's feet.
Oh, relax, Jack and the Gay-stalk.
They're not Uncle D's.
I couldn't do it, all right?
The guy was a fucking legend, and you should be ashamed of yourself for even suggesting the idea in the first place.
Me?
But-
- No, but Armin Scheuller--
Armin Scheuller with the gun expected--
Relax.
Armin Scheuller will never know the difference.
But whose feet were they?
I don't know.
Some hobo's.
Ah.
Oh-
- Oh, Richard!
Richard, I know how we can get Dot to confess she's your shadowy figure!
By cutting off her feet?
Maybe we can sell them to Armin and double our money!
No, no, no, not that.
Look, we convinced Armin Scheuller that those hobo feet were actually Dexter Laine's--
We?
Yeah, so now we can trick Dot into believing that you remember everything about that tryst with her.
Look, we know that you can't remember anything from that night, but she doesn't!
It's not a bad idea, Larry.
Yes!
Is this some kind of joke?
Oh, no.
No, it's--
It's an apology.
I've said and done some things lately that I probably shouldn't have.
And nothing says, "Oh, fuck, sorry,"
like a bucket of Dirty Bird.
It will take more than fried chicken for me to forgive you for breaking into my apartment, stealing my personal property and sexually harassing me.
Uh-huh, which is why we also bought you this.
Peach schnapps.
Thank you.
Give it up, Foxley!
We know it was you.
You are behind all of it, the graffiti, the sexual tape, the desecration of Babs Devon's grave!
Hey, back off, Larry.
Just because she doesn't like you, doesn't make her the dealership bike.
Ooh, Dirty Birdie.
Hey, it's not your business, Josh!
Hos before bros, bro.
You don't have a single piece of concrete evidence against me.
Well, perhaps you forgot about your night of passion at the Madison Arms, hm?
What night?
What night?
Mm-hm.
Uh...
Uh, you know, that night.
That night that we watched a knife thrower and ate fried chicken and pounded Bellinis.
And then we went back to our room at the Madison arms.
And then--
Wait a minute.
I remember that night now.
We drank Bellinis, we ate fried chicken, and then we took 'Ludes!
Love 'Ludes.
Oh, oh, Miss Foxley, we--
We've made a terrible mistake.
Richard, I know the night you're talking about, and I remember the woman you were with.
And she was-- Whoo.
She was no Dot Foxley.
It was the morning after you judged the Miss Super-Sized Super-Save Beauty Pageant.
Oh, Richard.
Your night of debauchery with the fourth runner-up resulted in an overdose on 'Ludes and schnapps.
We had to get to Emergency!
Schnapps!
Yeah, send an ambulance to the Madison Arms, room 201, as fast as possible!
Please and thank you!
Okay.
You just thought of this now?
Do you have any idea how many motel rooms I pulled you out of?
So many women, so many vibrating beds, so--
So sorry.
For what?
The libel?
The slander?
The sexual harassment?
The break-in?
Save your apologies.
This little performance is the final nail in your coffin,
Richard Fitzpatrick.
Way to go, Larry.
I let you take a photo of the train-track mark on my ass for nothing.
Train-track marks?
J'accuse!
A train-track hickey.
Clicketty-clack, courtesy of Dot Foxley.
And her hidden braces.
Just tighten them, dammit!
Knives!
Whoa!
Where did those come from?
Put your pants on!
Miss Carbs.
So you finally remembered?
I had it all, the suffocating talent, the big-boned beauty, a custom-made size-24 swimsuit and judge with a knife fetish.
When you volunteered to be my target,
I thought it was in the bag.
And the Miss Super-Sized Super-Save crown goes to Miss Big and Tall!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I fell for the oldest trick in the book.
After you fixed the results to make sure I lost, you swept in to console me.
That is a classic.
Shht!
- You were everything
- I ever wanted in a man, handsome, debonair, male.
No, no, I can't!
I always promised myself I'd save this for my husband!
Whatever you want, baby.
Oh, yes, darling.
I will marry you.
Dr. Parsons to Cardiology.
Dr. Parsons to Cardiology.
Fitz?
Fitzy?
Darling?
You partied me into unconsciousness, then abandoned me.
Oh, wow.
Well, Richard, the whole point of this exercise was to identify the person you were wronged and make amends.
And that starts with apologizing for this sad, strange series of events.
- Fuck off, Larry.
- What?
I don't want an apology.
I just want you.
Not on my watch, lady.
Um, wait, what?
Hi, are you talking to me or Fitz?
Ahem!
I lost all that weight, took night courses in business management.
I even learned how to harness mystical forces.
I changed everything about myself, all for you.
Told you.
No, but what about all that awful stuff that's been happening to Richard?
Well, I never imagined my voodoo would be so strong.
Wait, are you saying you didn't make my mommy tape or dig up Babs Devon or any of the other bad shit?
All your bad luck, that's the power of my love.
It's a fortune-teller's prophecy.
Call it what you want, voodoo, karma, fate.
I will make you love me again, no matter what.
What did I ever do to you?
"'Ludes and schnapps."
Oh, wow, that should have worn off by now.
I had it tattooed, which I instantly regretted.
Oh, dear.
But it will always remind me of the night I fell in love.
I fell in love too, baby.
But we loved each other enough that one night to last a lifetime.
Ew.
I really am quite sorry.
Richard Fitzpatrick!
If you walk out that door now, know that I will spend the rest of my life making you suffer.
You want to go mano a mano with me, baby?
Bring it on, sweetheart.
I'll be laughing over your corpse long before you're laughing over mine.
Who said anything about killing you, you big lug nut?
You destroyed me psychologically, physically.
And because of it, I am a better person.
Definitely skinnier.
True change requires suffering.
For me to drag you through hell, that is real love.
So hang on tight, Richard Fitzpatrick.
I am going to change your life.
That is my job!
She took the chicken.
Well, that was quite an adventure.
Although it looks like we were wrong about Dot being your shadowy nemesis.
I guess the whole death prophecy, the Beaver Moon, it was all just a ruse.
Yeah.
No more nightmares, I guess.
Yeah, and now you don't have to worry about taking Josh's sloppy seconds.
All I'm worried about right now is getting a good night's sleep.
Of course, Richard.
Of course.
There's just one more thing you have to do.
What's that?
Die!
Oh, fuck.
Who sent you?
Did they send you?
Come out quietly, you are surrounded.
Hey, Johnny!
You didn't think I'd give up that easily, did you?
Oh, please, no!
He's going to jump!
Don't shoot!
Please don't shoot!
Argh!
He's gone.
The man who knew, he's gone.
Smoke around these lights again and you won't be back next week.
Three o'clock.
And how are you enjoying playing the part, Mr Le Ray?
Well, it's very exciting.
Terrific.
One does one's best with the script.
You're staring.
He was surprisingly good.
For a man in mourning.
Great show, Ron.
Bloody actors.
Ron.
She's coming over.
Hector's awful.
He says you've declined, but I refuse to believe it.
Tell me you will come this weekend?
She's very persistent.
I did try.
Wasn't my husband simply brilliant last night?
You dropped that second question.
Talk to Lix.
I did.
So, what did you think of our Man Who Knew?
Wasn't it ridiculous?
I knew who'd done it five minutes in, didn't I, Hector?
I said.
Yes.
Don't tell Adam.
He's one of my brother's bestest friends and he's had a terrible time.
It's all tres, tres tragique.
Tell me more.
I'm going to grab that.
Oh, here comes our shadow again.
And even when we are not working, you are always near.
We just cannot shake you, Mr McCain.
Remaining vigilant.
Miss Rowley's worried you have no life outside of work.
None as captivating as Miss Rowley and The Hour.
Damn fine programme last night,
I must say.
Transatlantic telephone cable systems have never seemed so interesting.
No, I thought the live call was a stroke of genius.
Thank you.
It was Miss Rowley's idea.
Wallace, there you are.
Do excuse me.
Wallace, I hear you're shooting this weekend.
Wave and smile.
I hate that man.
On the contrary, it's a mark of how well you are doing that you've rattled McCain's cage.
Please come this weekend.
The people are awful and you'll be screaming to go home by Sunday, but...
Darling, this man is brilliant.
You didn't tell me they were all so interesting.
Did you know a python could swallow a baby whole if it had a mind to?
No.
Well, she won't be persuaded.
A Town Like Alice is opening at The Coronet.
We could go next weekend.
I'm driving down with Daddy tonight, but Hector's bringing the car first thing.
I know he'd like the company.
And you must come, too, Mr Lyon.
I must.
You might find it quicker on the train.
Surely not.
Come on, darling.
You hate the country.
I lied.
Excuse me.
Mr Kish?
We've missed you.
You're surprisingly elusive.
And yet you are here tonight.
Yes.
Everyone says how hard you work at the World Service, yet whenever
I try to get hold of you you're never at your desk.
I hope they pay you overtime, whoever they are.
Were you following me yesterday?
Coming out of Embankment station?
Why would I do that?
You knew Ruth Elms.
I have you on film with her with her and Peter Darrall.
It looks like it was a sunny day.
You sat at my desk with her obituary stuck on the wall.
You said, "What a pretty girl".
She was.
Both are now dead.
That might unsettle some people.
Did you kill him?
Peter Darrall?
Yes.
Every time we played at cards.
The holiday I presume you are referring to was more of a weekend.
I don't recall anyone making a film.
Perhaps, Mr Lyon, we might have a drink sometime.
Steady.
Steady!
Ladies was blocked.
Is he good looking, do you think?
Do you classify that as a good-looking face?
It's all to do with symmetry.
The balance of the left and right of your face.
The more even you are, the more beautiful you are.
You see this eyebrow?
It's wider than me other one.
And my nose, I've got a dip right here.
But a good looking person, it would all be the same.
Equal.
Hmmm.
He doesn't really do much for me, but...
Isaac!
Just the man.
Tomorrow, I want you in.
It's Saturday.
Your commitment has been duly noted,
Mr Albert has had a film of mine for weeks, I gave it to him to look over.
Pick it up first thing.
Don't let it out of your sight.
Magpie!
Damn.
Six to your two.
What are you scribbling, Freddie?
I'm surprised we can lure you away from your desk.
"What is he writing?" I often ask myself.
Mainly the words that will come out of your mouth.
Whenever Sissy thrusts those hot little sheets of paper into my hand, I wonder if at last I'll find out why Mr Lyon is so intrigued by a debutante's suicide.
My first girlfriend was a debutante.
I wrote her pages of God-awful poetry to her during the war.
Line?
Line?
Happily forgotten.
I don't think I've ever been sent love poetry.
Yes, you have.
I do not know what it is about you
That closes and opens
Only something in the...
No, can't remember the rest.
'British and French governments are in close discussion 'in an attempt to resolve the crisis in Egypt.
The Suez Canal Company has constructed...
'But the power remains in Colonel Nasser's hands 'and there is growing unease as to which direction he will take.'
You're late.
Daddy's furious.
Leave the bags.
Jemima!
Darling!
Ooh, you're freezing!
You're all freezing.
You've missed the morning's drive.
Sorry, darling.
Come, come.
The pictures, I know.
Daddy thinks they're awfully creepy, but they're all Mummy's relatives.
Thieves and liars every one of them.
Each room is a different decor.
Not entirely to modern taste, but poor Mummy has very little imagination.
Miss Rowley, this is you, and you're in the green one.
I wasn't sure if you were together, but Hector thought not.
Even so, I've put you close.
We're tres liberal here.
Er, thank you, but there was really no need.
One never can tell how things will work out.
Bugger!
How the hell did Hector get out of it?
He hasn't.
I've sent him off to change.
Ralphie, meet our guests.
This is my brother.
He's a monster.
Hello.
Nice to meet you.
Hello.
I've been sent back.
Wrong socks.
Did you tell Mother Adam was coming down?
Ralphie, don't be boring.
She's invited those appalling Roedean girls again.
Good!
We're a little short of girls.
You did bring a dress?
Mummy!
Ralphie, don't be mean.
She's lying down.
Lunch is at one, then we always have a big walk afterwards.
C'est magnifique!
Shut up and go and change, please.
Swot!
It's Saturday.
Leave immediately.
Mr Lyon wanted me in.
Curiouser and curiouser.
And I had some work to do on my Jackson Pollock piece.
Hmm...
Mr Kish.
Almost a full house.
No-one told me to expect you in.
Didn't they?
I rather enjoy the place to myself at the weekend.
I've got the most horrible wallpaper.
What's yours like?
Remind me to lock that.
And your bed's softer than mine.
What are we doing here?
I don't know.
I've missed a gripping Saturday of Scrabble with mon papa...
Then sardines on toast for afters in front of the TV.
What's your excuse?
Oh, Christ!
I won't actually have to hold a gun, will I?
Settling in?
Oh, yes, very well, thank you.
You'll need boots.
It gets pretty muddy this time of the year.
Thank you.
Well, see you later, at lunch.
Oh, what?
He's being kind.
The Man Who Knew... shoots for real.
And I didn't even bring a dress.
You can have mine.
Oh, hell!
I'm surprised hell can spare him.
It was shot on 8mm.
Mr Albert said it was professionally developed, but he doesn't think over here.
The scratches on the lens could be sand.
And the pot looks eastern.
What else?
I don't know.
I've left the rest of the notes on your desk.
Then go and get them.
I can't.
He's sitting at it.
Who?
Mr Kish.
He's in?
What's he doing?
Eating a sandwich.
If it's of any interest, I think he's been drinking.
It takes one to know one, sweetheart.
What do I do?
Just watch him, and don't let that film out of your sight.
Away!
Away!
May I?
Yes, please.
We saw your show last night.
You do that news programme.
The odd outside broadcast.
Did you like it, The Man Who Knew?
Ingenious title.
We're still waiting on the reviews.
You haven't got today's paper?
No.
Have we met before?
I covered your engagement party.
Frederick Lyon.
Adam Le Ray.
My condolences on your loss.
Ralph, whose idea was it to sit me next to a journalist?
Marnie arranged the seating.
We're all friends here.
You've known each another a long time.
No, not long.
It was all a bit of a whirlwind.
Still...
Leave the boy alone, Mr Lyon.
It's the weekend.
And he's an awfully good shot.
You wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of him.
Gold reserves have taken a tumble.
Down £800,000 since July.
Does Eden know what he's going to do about it?
Let's solve this problem in Egypt, shall we, Wallace?
Then I will talk to you about gold.
When are you going to solve it?
The Soviets have just sent in "volunteers"
to help Nasser run the Canal.
That's very worrying, darling.
Please do not worry yourself, dear Mrs Sherman.
I can assure you there is a solution in hand and our Prime Minister will guide us through this crisis.
You and your boys at Westminster have been feeding us that line for weeks.
It's grown a little tired.
We've offered Nasser Egyptian representation on the Suez Canal Company board with a share in its profits.
And any pact is seen by Nasser as veiled colonialism.
The truth is you don't know what to do.
He's doing too little to provoke a war, but just enough to provoke our Prime Minister.
And why you think it is a good idea to let him on air exposing his frailty is...
I'm sure Angus would dutifully pass on your good thoughts to the Prime Minister.
Well, someone ought to, otherwise he may not take the country with him.
Marilyn Monroe has been sick with gastritis.
They've delayed the shooting of The Sleeping Prince for four days.
Olivier is apparently livid.
I'd have gastritis if I was married to that Mr Miller.
And his plays!
Hector and I went to see one last week.
What was it called again?
It escapes me now.
Oh, damn!
Bad luck!
Yes, wrong weight.
I prefer something lighter.
Stop fussing, Angus.
You're a little liverish today.
I've never understood the point of shooting.
That's cos you live in London.
The only thing they shoot in London is films or each other.
It grows on you.
Especially if you manage to...
When you actually hit something.
Did you get a chance to talk to him?
I thought you'd be interested.
I'm not an idiot.
I know you think you're on to something with Ruth Elms.
I am.
Well, you won't have much luck with Adam.
It's obvious as hell he wasn't in love with her.
Well, then he's a fool.
Girls like Ruth Elms are a rare breed.
You don't get it, do you?
You'll see.
He comes alive after dinner.
Marnie's got us all dancing in the dining room.
You shoot, we jive.
How many did you miss?
As many as I could.
I don't like shooting things.
How do you think they killed that beef you had for lunch?
With boredom.
Are you going to help me pluck them?
No, sorry.
I have to jive.
Isaac, you've been slurping that coffee for nearly an hour.
Surely, it's gone cold by now?
Mr Fendley.
Working the weekend?
Very good.
Mr Lyon wanted me to cover a couple of things.
Oh?
And what might those be?
What's he paying you?
A pint and a bag of chips.
You've been had.
He's not sure about Mr Kish.
Then he's just one on Mr Lyon's very long list.
You are the definition of enigma, Mr Lyon.
You clean a gun as if you've done it before.
Your father?
A poacher, I bet.
Tell me your secret, do.
Did you put pressure on Clarence to drop my interview with Lord Elms?
It was you, wasn't it?
The buck stops with your producer, I'd say.
You will encourage Miss Rowley and her team to work WITH us, Hector?
That's a little presumptuous, isn't it?
What do you mean, "will"?
It is to be advised.
Things in Suez will only get worse and the BBC may find itself coming under increasing pressure in the coming weeks if they don't.
You are a guest in my family's house, Angus.
Don't outstay your welcome.
Angus?
Got a light?
The Lord Elms film didn't blow.
Did it?
I'm starving, so you'll have to wait until after dinner if you want a fight.
I couldn't run them both.
I couldn't risk Hafiz and Lord Elm speaking out of turn.
It's censorship.
It is political sabotage...
Hafiz was the better story.
You would have done the same thing.
No.
Yes.
But I can't even get near him now.
He refuses even to take my calls.
Can you let it go just for one weekend?
Gist.
Bright, tree, rest, tribe, tone.
Stone, rover.
How the hell do you bloody decode it?
I don't know because I'm not a spy.
Well, it can't be that difficult.
Are you all right?
Bloody dog hair.
What's he doing now?
Translating Nasser's rejection of Menzies' proposals.
Clarence is in, talking to Lix.
'Have you told him anything?
'
No.
Er, yes, not much.
Not good, Mr Wengrow.
Not good.
Please, will you not just...
Oh, I've seen it all before.
Not on me.
Who are you talking to?
Isaac.
Ask what he's working on?
Pollock.
He's getting up.
To do what?
To put his wrapper in the bin.
Isaac, anything else in?
A Swedish ship scuttled in King George Dock, Hull.
Mine's squished over everything in my bag.
Apparently, it's on fire.
'Tell him that Pollock' only runs if he can get an interview.
He died four weeks ago.
It's all right, Isaac.
Oh.
I was worried you might not have towels.
I forgot toothpaste.
Careful not to get any on your silk.
Is it, silk?
One can't tell any more, what with all the marvellous new cheap synthetics.
Damn, he's leaving.
Follow him.
'How the hell does Lix know what you're doing as well?
'
Obvious, darling.
He's hardly Poirot.
'Don't let him follow him with the film.'
Tell him to lock it in my desk drawer.
'Lix, do you hear?
'
God!
Marnie just saw me coming out of you bathroom.
And?
I think Marnie's fun.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you the truth about the Lord Elms film.
Yes.
Just because you're one of them, don't act like them.
I won't.
I promise.
What if I've got it wrong?
What if there's nothing in this bloody crossword and I'm bored and...
Avoiding a grown-up life?
You?
You're right.
A momentary lapse.
They're very even.
Your ears.
Dinner.
Darling?
I knew it.
What?
Miss Rowley and Mr Lyon.
I've just seen her coming out of his bathroom.
Really?
Didn't I say?
What's wrong?
Don't put me near McCain at dinner.
What?
Nothing.
Freddie...
You can't possibly wear that jacket.
And those shoes.
It's a little long in the leg but you should make up for it with the shoes
The jacket would be...
Here's one of my old ones.
I was a little trimmer then.
I mean, no-one gives a monkey's what you wear.
It's bloody ridiculous.
We're just sitting down to eat.
No-one's getting married or buried or anything but we just do it.
We just obey these ridiculous rules, because Christ help us if we don't.
It's only a suit.
You need cufflinks.
Here.
Thank you.
She's a wonderful woman...
Bel.
Yes.
Well, don't be late.
There's never enough soup.
'And now for news from abroad.
Talks between the Five Nations Suez Committee and Colonel Nasser 'failed dramatically last night 'when the Egyptian President rejected the proposals put to him 'by Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies.
'On flying back to London...'
Looks likes he's turned down your proposal.
May I use your telephone?
Of course.
In the hall.
'Australia will have nothing to do...'
The only reason they sent Menzies is because America won't help.
And now look.
Complete farce.
If Eisenhower wasn't running for re-election the Americans would have stood by us more instead of hiding behind the United Nations and opening the door to Russia.
Perhaps the President knows something we don't.
Like how to win an election.
That was a very good point you made earlier, though.
Can you inform the Prime Minister I'm trying to get hold of him?
This country's become far too entrenched in what it thinks it's entitled to.
Perhaps it needs the likes of you and I to shake things up a bit.
I'm off.
All quiet?
Israel is becoming increasingly jumpy.
They don't like the Soviets in their back yard.
They'll be in Suez before us at this rate.
I saw.
Does Edith ever see you?
I pity that poor woman, Clarence, I really do.
And who should I pity, Lix?
No-one.
That's the way I like it.
Has Mr Kish gone?
No, not yet.
World Service speak very highly of him.
Well, his Arabic's brilliant.
Though I haven't found a single programme he's worked on in the eight years he's been at the BBC.
Night-night.
Mr Kish.
Still here?
I'm just making final amendments to Nasser's rejection of Menzies' proposals.
Lix wanted it all down.
What we have ever to do with ease, we must first do with diligence.
So beautiful on the page.
There are 28 basic letters.
It's the style that varies the form.
It's remarkable.
I think so.
Yes.
Kish?
Hungarian?
Russian.
On my father's side.
Don't work too late.
I'll be off then.
Good night, Mr Wengrow.
Night.
You don't dance, Angus?
No.
Don't dance.
Can't shoot.
What are you doing here?
Eden's called an emergency meeting.
I may have to leave early.
Well, we'll try not to miss you too much.
They're insisting everyone attends.
They again?
The mysterious they.
THEY don't want you to know who THEY are, do they, Angus?
Have you read it?
Middle section.
Adam Le Ray has all the charisma and threat of a carpetbagger.
One can forgive Mr Le Ray most things but a basic lack of talent is suspect in a man so devoid of anything else.
Well, I just did what you said.
And now the papers crucify me.
You need to go to bed.
Hector, take him up.
Yes, I think sleep would do him good.
You said marry her and everything would be all right.
Now she's dead!
Get him out.
Freddie, could you?
I'm all right.
I remember you now.
Get him out!
I DID WHAT YOU SAID!
I'm going to be sick.
What was he talking about?
God knows.
What do you mean?
Slap him.
Really?
Ow!
Ow!
Bastard!
What the hell did you mean?
You did what he said?
Who?
Was it McCain?
What did McCain tell you to do?
Marry her.
Marry her.
Ruth?
Shh, shh!
Well, you didn't think it was for love, did you?
A girl in trouble and me.
What?
!
If I married her then no-one would know what I am.
You should have bloody cared.
You should have bloody loved her!
Let him sleep it off.
Is he all right?
Why do you let him get drunk like that?
Every time, Ralph!
We were just having a bit of fun.
Oh, yes, of course.
Always fun.
No.
Leave him.
Did you hear what he said?
These silent deals are struck all the time, Freddie.
No.
Then consider yourself fortunate.
One learns to recognise it.
A slow deadening in the eyes.
An acceptance of defeat.
I lived with the Elms family.
During the war.
On and off.
My mother, she worked as a secretary for Lord Elms before she met my father.
They took me in during the Blitz.
The odd summer.
Christmas.
I hated shooting then.
I don't understand this world.
I've never understood it.
How any of you live.
There lies the rub.
Have you seen them?
Who?
Any of them.
67, 68, 69...
Sardines.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Why do grown-ups insist on playing party games?
Didn't we do enough of that as children?
I never had parties as a child.
Everyone had birthday parties.
Not me.
Well, not until I met Marnie.
Oh, you're in it for the cake.
97!
98... 99...
Coming!
Not here!
Shh!
Sardines!
Bel?
Precautionary measure.
Revert... to Brightstone.
"Better rovers tonight."
"Sherbet, invert, grotto."
"Brighteners veto tort."
It's a fair point, but...
it just jumps out at you.
Mm.
Like "observe trotenite".
Why would you marry someone you didn't love?
Are you asking?
Because you were lonely.
Because you had to.
Because you were in trouble.
Pregnant.
Is that...
That is what trouble means?
Poor innocent boy.
Because you had something to hide.
Because there was a promise of a career at the end of it.
Because the person that you loved...
was doing something they shouldn't.
Because the person that you loved...
was a spy passing secrets.
Freddie, it's one o'clock in the morning.
He knows.
He knows.
Revert to Brightstone.
You need to sleep.
Good idea.
Not with me.
Boring Moneypenny!
And stop calling me that!
I don't know what it is about you
That closes and opens
Only something in me understands the voice of your eyes
Is deeper than all roses
Nobody, not even the rain
Has such small hands.
EE Cummings.
That's the one.
Hector, you've just missed a wonderful game of Sardines.
Where were you?
Nowhere.
I'm awfully tired.
Aren't you?
Yes.
Hello.
Frederick?
Sorry?
Frederick?
Everyone is still asleep here.
Let me come with you.
It's fine.
Stay.
He's all right.
Someone broke in last night and he's just a bit shaken up.
Mrs B went over straight away.
Ready?
Really.
Can you slow down a bit?
You're very interesting to me, Mr Lyon.
I'd be more interesting alive than dead.
For all your socialist principles, no-one does as well as you without help.
Please just...
Let me out here.
I'll take the train.
Don't be ridiculous.
There's only one.
It won't get you to London until next week.
You think you heard something last night?
Hmmm.
What you actually heard were the drunk ramblings of an actor whose career is faltering at the starting gate.
I give The Man Who Knew a week.
I think you're wrong.
I think Adam Le Ray's a very interesting man with a lot to say for himself and I plan to listen and find out as much as I can.
I'm a big supporter of the spirit of inquiry.
A different time, I may well have offered you a job.
Work with us, Freddie.
I'd rather not.
The hours are appalling and the people are tedious.
I don't think it's privilege you dislike.
I think it's fear that in spite of it, you still won't be let in.
Drive carefully, won't you, darling?
We will.
Safe journey.
Bye, my dears.
Bye, Mummy.
Shall I take these?
You really don't have to drive me.
I insist.
Look after him.
Precious cargo.
Drive carefully.
Yes.
Do be careful, Hector.
Let's get you a cup of tea.
What are you doing here?
There was a break-in.
At my father's.
Good grief!
I'm so sorry.
Is he all right?
He's sleeping.
I just needed to get out.
Was anything taken?
Nothing.
Except a photo of me with my mother.
What's your excuse?
Oh, dinner with a dreadful great aunt.
I'm stalling for as long as I can, but...
The Egyptians have issued a new set of proposals.
Is Isaac in?
Somewhere, knee-deep in Pollock.
No, I can't put it off any longer.
She gets rather spiteful if I'm not there by the entree.
Did he give you the film?
No, he didn't.
He hasn't been seen all day, our Mr Kish.
Be careful, Freddie.
It's Sunday.
Look sad.
Go home or people will talk.
Are you going to say anything?
You haven't spoken the whole journey.
Bel... just say if you want this.
I left my raincoat.
Perhaps we could go for that drink now?
Coffee.
I want coffee.
They really, really do the best.
Shall we?
Good night!
Did you break into my house last night, Mr Kish?
Of course I didn't, Mr Lyon.
You're lying.
You came into my house and you frightened my father.
Is that what you do?
Frighten people?
You've got a very active imagination, Mr Lyon.
I don't think so.
Who do you work for?
The same people you do, Mr Lyon.
Then why are you spying on me?
You look like you were very good friends.
With Ruth and Peter.
You must miss him.
I do.
Then why aren't you helping me?
I know you know something.
Something you're not telling me.
Why?
I could help you.
You can't help me.
You are an amateur, Mr Lyon.
You know nothing about me.
I know everything about you.
I know that you live with your father.
That you go to the launderette on Wednesdays.
That you have no luck with girls.
You work too much.
You don't know what you've got yourself into, and now you know too much.
You're in the middle of a very dangerous world but you have convinced yourself that you are somehow immune.
You're not.
We can do this one of two ways.
You can stop playing games with me and tell me everything you know...
Or?
You don't have to do this, Mr Kish.
Mr Kish?
It is the confession, not the priest that gives us absolution.
My mother always said that to me.
It always worked.
Stolen cake.
"Bum" scrawled on a piece of paper.
If you kill me you might not meet someone so interested in the truth!
I don't want to die in the bloody office!
Mr Kish.
He knows.
It's you, isn't it?
What do you know?
Huh?
Better rovers tonight.
Brighteners veto tort.
Sherbet invert grotto!
Revert to Brightstone.
It's Brightstone, isn't it?
What is BRIGHTSTONE?
Who.
The question is who?
Hello?
'Can I come over?
'
Freddie, it's nearly midnight.
Is it?
'Go to bed.'
I can't.
I can't sleep.
Are you all right?
Yes.
'Night.'
Tom never mentioned you.
No, he wouldn't have.
We'd only recently met.
You went to see his wife?
!
Are you insane?
I was delivering my condolences.
You know, I didn't think she'd last as long as she has.
Douglas said you thought a lady would be easier to steer.
Yesterday and again this morning.
Blue car, black interior.
What?
!
Why am I being followed?
Miss Rowley?
Audacious.
Papers are in.
At worst, it was an accident.
There are no accidents... apparently.
Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd, MemoryOnSmells
The military are in central Alexandria.
Are we going to war?
Egyptian forces are swarming the Canal!
And what is the truth, Mr Hafiz?
If you come onto our programme, perhaps you'd have the chance to tell the country.
If I'm interviewed by a gentleman.
One young woman in particular has caught the eye of a certain leading man, actor Adam Le Ray.
So without further ado I ask you to raise your glasses to my beautiful fiance.
They will kill me 'if they know I'm talking to you.'
This is Mr...?
Kish.
Thomas Kish.
This is for Bel... not for you.
You're still an arse.
Don't be frightened.
Gravity.
You have a natural gravity.
FOOTSTEPS
DOOR BURSTS OPEN
Who sent you?
Did they send you?
MEGAPHONE:
Come out quietly, you are surrounded.
Hey, Johnny!
You didn't think I'd give up that easily, did you?
Oh, please, no!
FAKED FOOTSTEPS
He's going to jump!
FOOTSTEPS QUICKEN
Don't shoot!
Please don't shoot!
GUNSHOT
THUD OF A BODY Argh!
FOOTSTEPS EXIT
He's gone.
The man who knew, he's gone.
APPLAUSE
Smoke around these lights again and you won't be back next week.
Three o'clock.
And how are you enjoying playing the part, Mr Le Ray?
Well, it's very exciting.
Terrific.
One does one's best with the script.
You're staring.
He was surprisingly good.
For a man in mourning.
Great show, Ron.
Bloody actors.
Ron.
What are we doing here?
The drinks are free.
Oh, good.
She's coming over.
Hector's awful.
He says you've declined, but I refuse to believe it.
Tell me you will come this weekend?
She's very persistent.
I did try.
Wasn't my husband simply brilliant last night?
You dropped that second question.
Talk to Lix.
I did.
So, what did you think of our Man Who Knew?
Wasn't it ridiculous?
I knew who'd done it five minutes in, didn't I, Hector?
I said.
Yes.
Don't tell Adam.
He's one of my brother's bestest friends and he's had a terrible time.
It's all tres, tres tragique.
Tell me more.
I'm going to grab that.
Oh, here comes our shadow again.
And even when we are not working, you are always near.
We just cannot shake you, Mr McCain.
Remaining vigilant.
Miss Rowley's worried you have no life outside of work.
None as captivating as Miss Rowley and The Hour.
Damn fine programme last night,
I must say.
Transatlantic telephone cable systems have never seemed so interesting.
No, I thought the live call was a stroke of genius.
Thank you.
It was Miss Rowley's idea.
Wallace, there you are.
Do excuse me.
Wallace, I hear you're shooting this weekend.
Wave and smile.
I hate that man.
On the contrary, it's a mark of how well you are doing that you've rattled McCain's cage.
Please come this weekend.
The people are awful and you'll be screaming to go home by Sunday, but...
Darling, this man is brilliant.
You didn't tell me they were all so interesting.
Did you know a python could swallow a baby whole if it had a mind to?
No.
Well, she won't be persuaded.
A Town Like Alice is opening at The Coronet.
We could go next weekend.
I'm driving down with Daddy tonight, but Hector's bringing the car first thing.
I know he'd like the company.
And you must come, too, Mr Lyon.
I must.
You might find it quicker on the train.
Surely not.
Come on, darling.
You hate the country.
I lied.
Excuse me.
Mr Kish?
We've missed you.
You're surprisingly elusive.
And yet you are here tonight.
Yes.
Everyone says how hard you work at the World Service, yet whenever
I try to get hold of you you're never at your desk.
I hope they pay you overtime, whoever they are.
Were you following me yesterday?
Coming out of Embankment station?
Why would I do that?
You knew Ruth Elms.
I have you on film with her with her and Peter Darrall.
It looks like it was a sunny day.
You sat at my desk with her obituary stuck on the wall.
You said, "What a pretty girl".
She was.
Both are now dead.
That might unsettle some people.
Did you kill him?
Peter Darrall?
Yes.
Every time we played at cards.
The holiday I presume you are referring to was more of a weekend.
I don't recall anyone making a film.
Perhaps, Mr Lyon, we might have a drink sometime.
Steady.
Steady!
Ladies was blocked.
Is he good looking, do you think?
Do you classify that as a good-looking face?
It's all to do with symmetry.
The balance of the left and right of your face.
The more even you are, the more beautiful you are.
You see this eyebrow?
It's wider than me other one.
And my nose, I've got a dip right here.
But a good looking person, it would all be the same.
Equal.
Hmmm.
He doesn't really do much for me, but...
Isaac!
Just the man.
Tomorrow, I want you in.
It's Saturday.
Your commitment has been duly noted,
Mr Albert has had a film of mine for weeks, I gave it to him to look over.
Pick it up first thing.
Don't let it out of your sight.
Magpie!
Damn.
Six to your two.
What are you scribbling, Freddie?
I'm surprised we can lure you away from your desk.
"What is he writing?" I often ask myself.
Mainly the words that will come out of your mouth.
Whenever Sissy thrusts those hot little sheets of paper into my hand, I wonder if at last I'll find out why Mr Lyon is so intrigued by a debutante's suicide.
My first girlfriend was a debutante.
I wrote her pages of God-awful poetry to her during the war.
Line?
Line?
Happily forgotten.
I don't think I've ever been sent love poetry.
Yes, you have.
I do not know what it is about you
That closes and opens
Only something in the...
No, can't remember the rest.
NEWSREADER: 'British and French governments are in close discussion 'in an attempt to resolve the crisis in Egypt.
The Suez Canal Company has constructed...
'But the power remains in Colonel Nasser's hands 'and there is growing unease as to which direction he will take.'
You're late.
Daddy's furious.
Leave the bags.
Jemima!
Darling!
Ooh, you're freezing!
You're all freezing.
You've missed the morning's drive.
Sorry, darling.
Come, come.
The pictures, I know.
Daddy thinks they're awfully creepy, but they're all Mummy's relatives.
Thieves and liars every one of them.
Each room is a different decor.
Not entirely to modern taste, but poor Mummy has very little imagination.
Miss Rowley, this is you, and you're in the green one.
I wasn't sure if you were together, but Hector thought not.
Even so, I've put you close.
We're tres liberal here.
Er, thank you, but there was really no need.
One never can tell how things will work out.
DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS
Bugger!
How the hell did Hector get out of it?
He hasn't.
I've sent him off to change.
Ralphie, meet our guests.
This is my brother.
He's a monster.
Hello.
Nice to meet you.
Hello.
I've been sent back.
Wrong socks.
Did you tell Mother Adam was coming down?
Ralphie, don't be boring.
She's invited those appalling Roedean girls again.
Good!
We're a little short of girls.
You did bring a dress?
Mummy!
Ralphie, don't be mean.
She's lying down.
Lunch is at one, then we always have a big walk afterwards.
C'est magnifique!
Shut up and go and change, please.
Swot!
It's Saturday.
Leave immediately.
Mr Lyon wanted me in.
Curiouser and curiouser.
And I had some work to do on my Jackson Pollock piece.
Hmm...
LIFT BELL RINGS
Mr Kish.
Almost a full house.
No-one told me to expect you in.
Didn't they?
I rather enjoy the place to myself at the weekend.
I've got the most horrible wallpaper.
What's yours like?
Remind me to lock that.
And your bed's softer than mine.
What are we doing here?
I don't know.
I've missed a gripping Saturday of Scrabble with mon papa...
Then sardines on toast for afters in front of the TV.
What's your excuse?
GUNSHOT
Oh, Christ!
I won't actually have to hold a gun, will I?
THEY LAUGH
KNOCK AT DOOR
Settling in?
Oh, yes, very well, thank you.
You'll need boots.
It gets pretty muddy this time of the year.
Thank you.
Well, see you later, at lunch.
Oh, what?
He's being kind.
The Man Who Knew... shoots for real.
And I didn't even bring a dress.
You can have mine.
Oh, hell!
I'm surprised hell can spare him.
It was shot on 8mm.
Mr Albert said it was professionally developed, but he doesn't think over here.
The scratches on the lens could be sand.
And the pot looks eastern.
What else?
I don't know.
I've left the rest of the notes on your desk.
Then go and get them.
I can't.
He's sitting at it.
Who?
Mr Kish.
He's in?
What's he doing?
Eating a sandwich.
If it's of any interest, I think he's been drinking.
It takes one to know one, sweetheart.
What do I do?
Just watch him, and don't let that film out of your sight.
Away!
Away!
May I?
Yes, please.
We saw your show last night.
You do that news programme.
The odd outside broadcast.
Did you like it, The Man Who Knew?
Ingenious title.
We're still waiting on the reviews.
You haven't got today's paper?
No.
Have we met before?
I covered your engagement party.
Frederick Lyon.
Adam Le Ray.
My condolences on your loss.
Ralph, whose idea was it to sit me next to a journalist?
Marnie arranged the seating.
We're all friends here.
You've known each another a long time.
No, not long.
It was all a bit of a whirlwind.
Still...
Leave the boy alone, Mr Lyon.
It's the weekend.
And he's an awfully good shot.
You wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of him.
Gold reserves have taken a tumble.
Down £800,000 since July.
Does Eden know what he's going to do about it?
Let's solve this problem in Egypt, shall we, Wallace?
Then I will talk to you about gold.
When are you going to solve it?
The Soviets have just sent in "volunteers"
to help Nasser run the Canal.
That's very worrying, darling.
Please do not worry yourself, dear Mrs Sherman.
I can assure you there is a solution in hand and our Prime Minister will guide us through this crisis.
You and your boys at Westminster have been feeding us that line for weeks.
It's grown a little tired.
We've offered Nasser Egyptian representation on the Suez Canal Company board with a share in its profits.
And any pact is seen by Nasser as veiled colonialism.
The truth is you don't know what to do.
He's doing too little to provoke a war, but just enough to provoke our Prime Minister.
And why you think it is a good idea to let him on air exposing his frailty is...
I'm sure Angus would dutifully pass on your good thoughts to the Prime Minister.
Well, someone ought to, otherwise he may not take the country with him.
Marilyn Monroe has been sick with gastritis.
They've delayed the shooting of The Sleeping Prince for four days.
Olivier is apparently livid.
I'd have gastritis if I was married to that Mr Miller.
And his plays!
Hector and I went to see one last week.
What was it called again?
It escapes me now.
GUNSHOTS
GUNSHOTS
GUNSHOTS
GUNSHOT
Oh, damn!
Bad luck!
Yes, wrong weight.
I prefer something lighter.
Stop fussing, Angus.
You're a little liverish today.
I've never understood the point of shooting.
That's cos you live in London.
The only thing they shoot in London is films or each other.
It grows on you.
Especially if you manage to...
GUNSHOTS
When you actually hit something.
Did you get a chance to talk to him?
I thought you'd be interested.
I'm not an idiot.
I know you think you're on to something with Ruth Elms.
I am.
Well, you won't have much luck with Adam.
It's obvious as hell he wasn't in love with her.
Well, then he's a fool.
Girls like Ruth Elms are a rare breed.
You don't get it, do you?
You'll see.
He comes alive after dinner.
GUNSHOT
Marnie's got us all dancing in the dining room.
You shoot, we jive.
How many did you miss?
As many as I could.
I don't like shooting things.
How do you think they killed that beef you had for lunch?
With boredom.
Are you going to help me pluck them?
No, sorry.
I have to jive.
Isaac, you've been slurping that coffee for nearly an hour.
Surely, it's gone cold by now?
Mr Fendley.
Working the weekend?
Very good.
Mr Lyon wanted me to cover a couple of things.
Oh?
And what might those be?
What's he paying you?
A pint and a bag of chips.
You've been had.
He's not sure about Mr Kish.
Then he's just one on Mr Lyon's very long list.
You are the definition of enigma, Mr Lyon.
You clean a gun as if you've done it before.
Your father?
A poacher, I bet.
Tell me your secret, do.
Did you put pressure on Clarence to drop my interview with Lord Elms?
It was you, wasn't it?
The buck stops with your producer, I'd say.
You will encourage Miss Rowley and her team to work WITH us, Hector?
That's a little presumptuous, isn't it?
What do you mean, "will"?
It is to be advised.
Things in Suez will only get worse and the BBC may find itself coming under increasing pressure in the coming weeks if they don't.
You are a guest in my family's house, Angus.
Don't outstay your welcome.
Angus?
Got a light?
The Lord Elms film didn't blow.
Did it?
I'm starving, so you'll have to wait until after dinner if you want a fight.
I couldn't run them both.
I couldn't risk Hafiz and Lord Elm speaking out of turn.
It's censorship.
It is political sabotage...
Hafiz was the better story.
You would have done the same thing.
No.
Yes.
But I can't even get near him now.
He refuses even to take my calls.
Can you let it go just for one weekend?
Gist.
Bright, tree, rest, tribe, tone.
Stone, rover.
How the hell do you bloody decode it?
I don't know because I'm not a spy.
Well, it can't be that difficult.
Are you all right?
Bloody dog hair.
What's he doing now?
Translating Nasser's rejection of Menzies' proposals.
Clarence is in, talking to Lix.
'Have you told him anything?
'
No.
Er, yes, not much.
Not good, Mr Wengrow.
Not good.
Please, will you not just...
Oh, I've seen it all before.
Not on me.
Who are you talking to?
Isaac.
Ask what he's working on?
Pollock.
He's getting up.
To do what?
To put his wrapper in the bin.
Isaac, anything else in?
A Swedish ship scuttled in King George Dock, Hull.
Mine's squished over everything in my bag.
Apparently, it's on fire.
'Tell him that Pollock' only runs if he can get an interview.
He died four weeks ago.
It's all right, Isaac.
Oh.
I was worried you might not have towels.
I forgot toothpaste.
Careful not to get any on your silk.
Is it, silk?
One can't tell any more, what with all the marvellous new cheap synthetics.
Damn, he's leaving.
Follow him.
'How the hell does Lix know what you're doing as well?
'
Obvious, darling.
He's hardly Poirot.
'Don't let him follow him with the film.'
Tell him to lock it in my desk drawer.
'Lix, do you hear?
'
God!
Marnie just saw me coming out of you bathroom.
And?
I think Marnie's fun.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you the truth about the Lord Elms film.
Yes.
Just because you're one of them, don't act like them.
I won't.
I promise.
What if I've got it wrong?
What if there's nothing in this bloody crossword and I'm bored and...
Avoiding a grown-up life?
You?
You're right.
A momentary lapse.
They're very even.
Your ears.
CLOCK CHIMES
Dinner.
Darling?
I knew it.
What?
Miss Rowley and Mr Lyon.
I've just seen her coming out of his bathroom.
Really?
Didn't I say?
What's wrong?
Don't put me near McCain at dinner.
What?
Nothing.
Freddie...
You can't possibly wear that jacket.
And those shoes.
It's a little long in the leg but you should make up for it with the shoes
The jacket would be...
Here's one of my old ones.
I was a little trimmer then.
I mean, no-one gives a monkey's what you wear.
It's bloody ridiculous.
We're just sitting down to eat.
No-one's getting married or buried or anything but we just do it.
We just obey these ridiculous rules, because Christ help us if we don't.
It's only a suit.
You need cufflinks.
Here.
Thank you.
CLOCK CHIMES
She's a wonderful woman...
Bel.
Yes.
Well, don't be late.
There's never enough soup.
'And now for news from abroad.
Talks between the Five Nations Suez Committee and Colonel Nasser 'failed dramatically last night 'when the Egyptian President rejected the proposals put to him 'by Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies.
'On flying back to London...'
Looks likes he's turned down your proposal.
May I use your telephone?
Of course.
In the hall.
'Australia will have nothing to do...'
The only reason they sent Menzies is because America won't help.
And now look.
Complete farce.
If Eisenhower wasn't running for re-election the Americans would have stood by us more instead of hiding behind the United Nations and opening the door to Russia.
Perhaps the President knows something we don't.
Like how to win an election.
That was a very good point you made earlier, though.
Can you inform the Prime Minister I'm trying to get hold of him?
This country's become far too entrenched in what it thinks it's entitled to.
Perhaps it needs the likes of you and I to shake things up a bit.
I'm off.
All quiet?
Israel is becoming increasingly jumpy.
They don't like the Soviets in their back yard.
They'll be in Suez before us at this rate.
I saw.
Does Edith ever see you?
I pity that poor woman, Clarence, I really do.
And who should I pity, Lix?
No-one.
That's the way I like it.
Has Mr Kish gone?
No, not yet.
World Service speak very highly of him.
Well, his Arabic's brilliant.
Though I haven't found a single programme he's worked on in the eight years he's been at the BBC.
Night-night.
Mr Kish.
Still here?
I'm just making final amendments to Nasser's rejection of Menzies' proposals.
Lix wanted it all down.
What we have ever to do with ease, we must first do with diligence.
So beautiful on the page.
There are 28 basic letters.
It's the style that varies the form.
It's remarkable.
I think so.
Yes.
Kish?
Hungarian?
Russian.
On my father's side.
Don't work too late.
I'll be off then.
Good night, Mr Wengrow.
Night.
You don't dance, Angus?
No.
Don't dance.
Can't shoot.
What are you doing here?
Eden's called an emergency meeting.
I may have to leave early.
Well, we'll try not to miss you too much.
They're insisting everyone attends.
They again?
The mysterious they.
THEY don't want you to know who THEY are, do they, Angus?
Have you read it?
Middle section.
Adam Le Ray has all the charisma and threat of a carpetbagger.
One can forgive Mr Le Ray most things but a basic lack of talent is suspect in a man so devoid of anything else.
Well, I just did what you said.
And now the papers crucify me.
You need to go to bed.
Hector, take him up.
Yes, I think sleep would do him good.
You said marry her and everything would be all right.
Now she's dead!
Get him out.
Freddie, could you?
I'm all right.
I remember you now.
Get him out!
I DID WHAT YOU SAID!
I'm going to be sick.
What was he talking about?
God knows.
What do you mean?
Slap him.
Really?
Ow!
HE LAUGHS
Ow!
Bastard!
What the hell did you mean?
You did what he said?
Who?
Was it McCain?
What did McCain tell you to do?
Marry her.
Marry her.
Ruth?
Shh, shh!
Well, you didn't think it was for love, did you?
A girl in trouble and me.
What?
!
If I married her then no-one would know what I am.
You should have bloody cared.
You should have bloody loved her!
Let him sleep it off.
Is he all right?
Why do you let him get drunk like that?
Every time, Ralph!
We were just having a bit of fun.
Oh, yes, of course.
Always fun.
No.
Leave him.
Did you hear what he said?
These silent deals are struck all the time, Freddie.
No.
Then consider yourself fortunate.
One learns to recognise it.
A slow deadening in the eyes.
An acceptance of defeat.
I lived with the Elms family.
During the war.
On and off.
My mother, she worked as a secretary for Lord Elms before she met my father.
They took me in during the Blitz.
The odd summer.
Christmas.
I hated shooting then.
I don't understand this world.
I've never understood it.
How any of you live.
There lies the rub.

Have you seen them?
Who?
Any of them.

Sardines.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Why do grown-ups insist on playing party games?
Didn't we do enough of that as children?
I never had parties as a child.
Everyone had birthday parties.
Not me.
Well, not until I met Marnie.
Oh, you're in it for the cake.

"Better rovers tonight."
"Sherbet, invert, grotto."
"Brighteners veto tort."
It's a fair point, but...
it just jumps out at you.
Mm.
Like "observe trotenite".
Why would you marry someone you didn't love?
Are you asking?
Because you were lonely.
Because you had to.
Because you were in trouble.
Pregnant.
Is that...
That is what trouble means?
Poor innocent boy.
Because you had something to hide.
Because there was a promise of a career at the end of it.
Because the person that you loved...
was doing something they shouldn't.
Because the person that you loved...
was a spy passing secrets.
Freddie, it's one o'clock in the morning.
He knows.
He knows.
Revert to Brightstone.
You need to sleep.
Good idea.
Not with me.
Boring Moneypenny!
And stop calling me that!
I don't know what it is about you
That closes and opens
Only something in me understands the voice of your eyes
Is deeper than all roses
Nobody, not even the rain
Has such small hands.
EE Cummings.
That's the one.
Hector, you've just missed a wonderful game of Sardines.
Where were you?
Nowhere.
I'm awfully tired.
Aren't you?
Yes.
PHONE RINGS
Hello.
Frederick?
Sorry?
Frederick?
Everyone is still asleep here.
HE WHIMPERS
Let me come with you.
It's fine.
Stay.
He's all right.
Someone broke in last night and he's just a bit shaken up.
Mrs B went over straight away.
Ready?
Really.
Can you slow down a bit?
You're very interesting to me, Mr Lyon.
I'd be more interesting alive than dead.
For all your socialist principles, no-one does as well as you without help.
Please just...
Let me out here.
I'll take the train.
Don't be ridiculous.
There's only one.
It won't get you to London until next week.
You think you heard something last night?
Hmmm.
What you actually heard were the drunk ramblings of an actor whose career is faltering at the starting gate.
I give The Man Who Knew a week.
I think you're wrong.
I think Adam Le Ray's a very interesting man with a lot to say for himself and I plan to listen and find out as much as I can.
I'm a big supporter of the spirit of inquiry.
A different time, I may well have offered you a job.
Work with us, Freddie.
I'd rather not.
The hours are appalling and the people are tedious.
HE LAUGHS
I don't think it's privilege you dislike.
I think it's fear that in spite of it, you still won't be let in.
Drive carefully, won't you, darling?
We will.
Safe journey.
Bye, my dears.
Bye, Mummy.
KNOCK ON DOOR
Shall I take these?
You really don't have to drive me.
I insist.
Look after him.
Precious cargo.
Drive carefully.
Yes.
Do be careful, Hector.
Let's get you a cup of tea.
What are you doing here?
There was a break-in.
At my father's.
Good grief!
I'm so sorry.
Is he all right?
He's sleeping.
I just needed to get out.
Was anything taken?
Nothing.
Except a photo of me with my mother.
What's your excuse?
Oh, dinner with a dreadful great aunt.
I'm stalling for as long as I can, but...
The Egyptians have issued a new set of proposals.
Is Isaac in?
Somewhere, knee-deep in Pollock.
No, I can't put it off any longer.
She gets rather spiteful if I'm not there by the entree.
Did he give you the film?
No, he didn't.
He hasn't been seen all day, our Mr Kish.
Be careful, Freddie.
It's Sunday.
Look sad.
Go home or people will talk.
Are you going to say anything?
You haven't spoken the whole journey.
Bel... just say if you want this.
DOOR OPENS
I left my raincoat.
Perhaps we could go for that drink now?
Coffee.
I want coffee.
They really, really do the best.
Shall we?
Good night!
Did you break into my house last night, Mr Kish?
Of course I didn't, Mr Lyon.
You're lying.
You came into my house and you frightened my father.
Is that what you do?
Frighten people?
You've got a very active imagination, Mr Lyon.
I don't think so.
Who do you work for?
The same people you do, Mr Lyon.
Then why are you spying on me?
You look like you were very good friends.
With Ruth and Peter.
You must miss him.
I do.
Then why aren't you helping me?
I know you know something.
Something you're not telling me.
Why?
I could help you.
You can't help me.
You are an amateur, Mr Lyon.
You know nothing about me.
I know everything about you.
I know that you live with your father.
That you go to the launderette on Wednesdays.
That you have no luck with girls.
You work too much.
You don't know what you've got yourself into, and now you know too much.
You're in the middle of a very dangerous world but you have convinced yourself that you are somehow immune.
You're not.
We can do this one of two ways.
You can stop playing games with me and tell me everything you know...
Or?
You don't have to do this, Mr Kish.
Mr Kish?
It is the confession, not the priest that gives us absolution.
My mother always said that to me.
It always worked.
Stolen cake.
"Bum" scrawled on a piece of paper.
If you kill me you might not meet someone so interested in the truth!
I don't want to die in the bloody office!
Mr Kish.
He knows.
It's you, isn't it?
What do you know?
Huh?
Better rovers tonight.
Brighteners veto tort.
Sherbet invert grotto!
Revert to Brightstone.
It's Brightstone, isn't it?
What is BRIGHTSTONE?
Who.
The question is who?

'Night.'

Tom never mentioned you.
No, he wouldn't have.
We'd only recently met.
You went to see his wife?

Are you insane?
I was delivering my condolences.
You know, I didn't think she'd last as long as she has.
Douglas said you thought a lady would be easier to steer.
Yesterday and again this morning.
Blue car, black interior.

Audacious.
Papers are in.
At worst, it was an accident.
There are no accidents... apparently.

Oh, please, no!
He's going to jump!
Don't shoot.
Please don't shoot!

Smoke around these lights again and you won't be back next week.
Three o'clock.

REPORTER:
And how are you enjoying the part, Mr Le Ray?
It's very exciting.
Terrific.
One does one's best with the script.
You're staring.
He was surprisingly good.
For a man in mourning.
- Great show, Ron.
- Bloody actors.
Ron...
- What are we doing here?
- The drinks are free.
Oh good, she's coming over.
Hector's awful.
He says you've declined, but I refuse to believe it.
Tell me you will come this weekend.
She's very persistent.
I did try.
Wasn't my husband simply brilliant last night?
- You dropped that second question.
- Talk to Lix.
I did.
So what do we think of our Man Who Knew?
Wasn't it ridiculous?
I knew who'd done it five minutes in, didn't I, Hector?
- I said.
- Yes.
But don't tell Adam.
He's one of my brother's bestest friends.
And he's had a terrible time.
It's all trés, trés tragique.
Tell me more.
I'm going to grab that...
MAN:
Wonderful show, Adam.
Good evening, good evening.
Hmm.
Here comes our shadow again.
And even when we are not working, you are always near.
- We just cannot shake you, Mr McCain.
- Remaining vigilant.
Miss Rowley is worried that you have no life outside of work, Angus.
None as captivating as Miss Rowley and The Hour.
Damned fine programme last night, I must say.
And transatlantic telephone cable systems have never seemed so interesting.
I thought the live call was a stroke of genius.
Thank you.
It was Miss Rowley's idea.
Oh.
Wallace, there you are.
Do excuse me.
Wallace, I hear you're shooting this weekend...
Wave and smile.
I hate that man.
On the contrary.
It's a mark of how well you're doing that you've rattled McCain's cage.
Please come this weekend.
The people are awful and you'll be screaming to go home by Sunday but...
Darling, this man is brilliant.
You didn't tell me they were all so interesting.
Did you know a python could swallow a baby whole if it had a mind to?
No.
Well, she won't be persuaded.
A Town Like Alike is opening at the Coronet.
We could go next weekend.
I'm driving down with Daddy tonight, but Hector's bringing the car first thing.
I know he'd like the company.
- And you must come too, Mr Lyon.
- I must.
- You might find it quicker on the train.
- Surely not.
Come on, love.
- You hate the country.
- I lied.
Excuse me.
Mr Kish?
We've missed you.
You're surprisingly elusive.
- And yet you're here tonight.
- Yes.
Everyone says how hard you work at the World Service.
And yet whenever I try to get hold of you, you're never at your desk.
I hope they pay you overtime, whoever they are.
Were you following me yesterday?
Coming out of Embankment Station?
- Why would I do that?
- You knew Ruth Elms.
I have you on film with her, with her and Peter Darrall.
Looks like it was a sunny day.
You sat at my desk with her obituary stuck on the wall.
- You said what a pretty girl...
- She was.
Both are now dead.
That might unsettle some people.
Did you kill him?
- Peter Darrall?
- Yes.
Every time we played at cards.
The holiday I presume you're referring to was more of a weekend.
I don't recall anyone making a film.
Perhaps, Mr Lyon, we might have a drink sometime?
-(BANGING)
- WORKER:
Steady, steady.
Ladies was blocked.
Is he good-looking, do you think?
Would you classify that as a good-looking face?
It's all to do with symmetry and the balance of the left and the right of your face.
You see, the more even you are, the more beautiful you are.
You see this eyebrow?
It's wider than the other one.
And me nose, I got a dip right here.
But a good-looking person, it'll all be the same, equal.
Hmm.
Well, he doesn't really do much for me but...
Isaac. just the man.
- Tomorrow, I want you in.
- It's Saturday.
Your commitment has been duly noted.
Mr Albert has had a film of mine for weeks.
I gave it to him to look over.
You're to pick it up first thing.
Don't let it out of your sight.
- Magpie.
- Damn.
Six to your two.
What are you scribbling, Freddie?
I'm surprised we can lure you away from your desk.
"What is he writing?" I often ask myself.
Mainly the words that will come out of your mouth.
Whenever Sissy thrusts those hot little sheets of paper into my hand,
I wonder if at last I'll find out why Mr Lyon is so intrigued by a debutante's suicide?
My first girlfriend was a debutante.
I wrote her pages of godawful poetry during the war.
Line?
- Line?
- Happily forgotten.
(LAUGHS)
I don't think I've ever been sent love poetry.
Yes, you have.
"I do not know what it is about you
"that closes and opens;
only something in me..."
No.
Can't remember the rest.
MAN:
Meanwhile, British and French governments are in close discussion in an attempt to resolve the crisis immediately.
The Suez Canal Company has been occupied with keeping working.
But the power remains in Colonel Nasser's hands and there is growing unease as to which direction he will take.
(DOG BARKING)
You're late!
Daddy's furious.
MARNIE:
Leave the bags.
- Jemima.
- Darling.
Oh, you're freezing.
You're all freezing.
- You missed the morning's drive.
- Sorry, darling.
Come, come.
The pictures, I know, I know.
Daddy thinks they're awfully creepy but they're all Mummy's relatives.
Thieves and liars, every one of them.
Each room is a different decor.
Not entirely to modern taste, but poor Mummy has very little imagination.
Miss Rowley, this is you.
And you're in the green one.
I wasn't sure if you were together, but Hector thought not.
Even so, I put you close.
We're trés libéral here.
Thank you, but there was really no need.
One never can tell how things will work out.
Bugger!
How the hell did Hector get out of it?
He hasn't.
I've sent him off to change.
Ralphie, meet our guests.
This is my brother.
- He's a monster.
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.
I've been sent back.
Wrong socks.
Did you tell Mother Adam was coming down?
Ralphie, don't be boring.
She's invited those appalling Roedean girls again.
Well, good.
We're a little short of girls.
- You did bring a dress?
- RALPH:
Mummy!
Ralphie, don't be mean.
She's lying down.
Lunch is at 1:00.
Then we always have a big walk afterwards.
C'est magnifique!
Shut up and go and change, please.
Swot!
- It's Saturday.
Leave immediately.
- Mr Lyon wanted me in.
Curiouser and curiouser.
And I had some work to do on my Jackson Pollock piece.
Hmm.
Mr Kish, almost a full house.
- No one told me to expect you in.
- Didn't they?
I rather enjoy the place to myself for the weekend.
I've got the most horrible wallpaper.
What's yours like?
Remind me to lock that.
And your bed's softer than mine.
(LAUGHING)
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know.
I've missed a gripping Saturday of Scrabble with man papa, then sardines on toast for afters in front of the TV.
What's your excuse?
(GUNSHOTS FIRING)
Oh, Christ.
I won't actually have to hold a gun, will I?
(LAUGHING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- Settling in?
- Oh, yes.
Very well, thank you.
You'll need boots.
It gets pretty muddy this time of year.
Thank you.
Well, see you later.
At lunch.
Oh, what?
He's being kind.
The Man Who Knew.
Shoots for real.
- And I didn't even bring a dress.
- You can have mine.
Oh, hell!
FREDDIE:
I'm surprised hell can spare him.
It was shot on 8 mm.
Mr Albert said it was professionally developed, but he doesn't think over here.
The scratches on the lens could be sand.
And the pot looks Eastern.
- What else?
- I don't know.
I've left the rest of the notes on your desk.
- Then go and get them.
-I can't.
- He's sitting at it.
- Who?
Mr Kish.
He's in?
What's he doing?
Eating a sandwich.
If it's of any interest, I think he's been drinking.
- It takes one to know one, sweetheart.
- What do I do?
Just watch him, and don't let that film out of your sight.
Away, away!
- May I?
- Yes, please.
We saw your show last night.
You do that news programme.
The odd outside broadcast.
Did you like it?
The Man Who Knew?
Ingenious title.
We're still waiting on the reviews.
You haven't got today's paper, have you?
- No.
- Have we met before?
I covered your engagement party.
Frederick Lyon.
Adam Le Ray.
My condolences on your loss.
Ralph, whose idea was it to sit me next to a journalist?
- Marnie arranged the seating.
- We're all friends here.
You've known each other a long time?
No, not long.
It's all a bit of a whirlwind.
- Still...
- Leave the boy alone, Mr Lyon.
It's the weekend.
He's an awfully good shot.
You wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of him.
(MIMICS GUNSHOT)
Gold reserves have taken a tumble.
Down £800,000 since July.
Does Eden know what he's going do about it?
Let's solve this problem in Egypt, shall we, Wallace?
And then I'll talk to you about gold.
And when are you going to solve it?
The Soviets have just sent in "volunteers"
to help Nasser run the canal.
That's very worrying, darling.
Please do not worry yourself, dear Mrs Sherwin.
I can assure you there is a solution in hand, and our prime minister will guide us through this crisis.
You and your boys at Westminster have been feeding us that line for weeks.
It's growing a little tired.
We've offered Nasser
Egyptian representation on the Suez Canal Company board, with a share in its profits.
And any pact is seen by Nasser as veiled colonialism.
The truth is you don't know what to do.
He's doing too little to provoke a war, but just enough to provoke our prime minister.
And why you think it's a good idea to let him on air, exposing his frailty, is...
Well, I'm sure Angus will dutifully pass on your good thoughts to the Prime Minister, Freddie.
Well, someone ought to.
Otherwise he may not take the country with him.
Marilyn Monroe's been sick with gastritis.
Yes, they've had to delay the shooting of The Sleeping Prince for four days.
Olivier is apparently livid.
I'd have gastritis if I was married to that Mr Miller.
And his plays, Hector and I went to see one last week.
- What was it called again, Hector?
- It escapes me now.
(BEATERS SHOUTING)
Oh, damn.
- Bad luck!
- It's the wrong weight.
- I prefer something lighter.
- Stop fussing, Angus.
You're a little liverish today.
I've never understood the point of shooting.
That's because you live in London.
The only thing they shoot in London is films or each other.
It grows on you.
Especially if you manage to... (SHOOTING)
(BIRD THUDS)
When you actually hit something.
Did you get a chance to talk to him?
I thought you'd be interested.
I'm not an idiot.
I know you think you're onto something with Ruth Elms.
I am.
Well, you won't have much luck with Adam.
Obvious as hell he wasn't in love with her.
Well, then he's a fool.
Girls like Ruth Elms are a rare breed.
You don't get it, do you?
You'll see.
He comes alive after dinner.
(SHOOTING)
Marnie's got us all dancing in the dining room.
You shoot, we jive.
- How many did you miss?
- As many as I could.
I don't like shooting things.
Well, how do you think they killed that beef you had for lunch?
- With boredom?
-(LAUGHING)
Are you going to help me pluck them?
No, sorry.
Have to jive.
Isaac, you've been slurping that coffee for nearly an hour.
- Surely it's gone cold by now?
- Mr Fendley...
Working the weekend?
Very good.
Mr Lyon wanted me to cover a couple of things.
Oh?
What might those be?
What's he paying you?
- A pint and a bag of chips.
- You've been had.
He's not sure about Mr Kish.
Then he's just one on Mr Lyon's very long list.
You are the definition of enigma, Mr Lyon.
You clean a gun as if you've done it before.
Your father?
A poacher, I bet.
Tell me your secret, do.
Did you put pressure on Clarence to drop my interview with Lord Elms?
It was you, wasn't it?
The buck stops with your producer, I'd say.
You will encourage Miss Rowley and her team to work with us, Hector?
That's a little presumptuous, isn't it?
- What do you mean "will"?
- It is to be advised.
Things in Suez will only get worse and the BBC may find itself coming under increasing pressure in the coming weeks if they don't.
You are a guest in my family's house, Angus.
Don't outstay your welcome.
Angus...
Got a light?
The Lord Elms film didn't blow.
Did it?
I'm starving, so you're going to have to wait until after dinner if you want to fight.
I couldn't run them both.
I couldn't risk Hafiz and Lord Elms speaking out of turn.
It's censorship.
It's political sabotage...
Hafiz was the better story.
You would have done the same thing.
- No.
- Yes.
But I can't even get near him now.
He refuses even to take my calls.
Can you let it go just for one weekend?
Gist,
Bright, Tree,
Rest, Tribe, Tone,
Stone, Rover...
How the hell do you bloody decode it?
I don't know, because I'm not a spy.
Well, it can't be that difficult!
Are you all right?
Bloody dog hair.
What's he doing now?
Translating Nasser's rejection of Menzies' proposals.
And Clarence is in.
Talking to Lix.
- Have you told him anything?
-No.
Uh, yes.
Not much.
Not good, Mr Wengrow, not good.
Please will you not just...
- Oh, I've seen it all before.
- Not on me.
- Who are you talking to?
- Isaac.
- Ask him what he's working on.
- Pollock.
- He's getting up.
- To do what?
Put his wrapper in the bin.
Isaac, anything else in?
Swedish ship scuttled in King George Dock, Hull.
Mine squished over everything in my bag.
Apparently, it's on fire.
Tell him that Pollock only runs if he can get an interview.
He died four weeks ago.
It's all right.
Oh...
I...was worried you might not have towels.
- I forgot toothpaste.
- Hmm.
Careful not to get any on your silk.
Is it silk?
One can't tell any more, what with all the marvellous new cheap synthetics.
Damn.
He's leaving.
Follow him.
How the hell does Lix know what you're doing as well?
Obvious, darling.
He's hardly Poirot.
Don't let him follow him with the film.
Tell him to lock it in my desk drawer.
Lix...
Do you hear?
God.
Marnie just saw me coming of your bathroom.
And?
I think Marnie's fun.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you the truth about the Lord Elms film.
Yes.
Just because you're one of them, don't act like them.
I won't.
I promise.
What if I've got it wrong?
What if there's nothing in this bloody crossword and I'm just bored and...
Avoiding a grown-up life?
You?
You're right.
A momentary lapse.
They're very even.
Your ears.
(BELL CHIMING)
Dinner.
Darling?
- I knew it.
- What?
Miss Rowley and Mr Lyon.
I've just seen her coming out of his bathroom.
- Really?
- Didn't I say?
What's wrong?
Don't put me near McCain at dinner.
What?
Nothing.
Freddie, you can't possibly wear that jacket and those shoes.
It's a little long in the leg, but you can make up for it with the shoes.
The jacket will be...
Here's one of my old ones.
I was a little trimmer then.
I mean, no one gives a monkey's what you're wearing.
It's bloody ridiculous.
We're just sitting down to eat.
No one's getting married or buried or anything but we just do it.
We just obey these ridiculous rules because Christ help us if we don't!
It's only a suit.

(DINNER BELL CHIMING)
She's a wonderful woman.

Yes.
Well, don't be late.
There's never enough soup.
NARRATOR:
And now for news from abroad.
Talks between the five-nation Suez committee and Colonel Nasser failed dramatically last night when the Egyptian president rejected the proposals put to him?
by Australian prime minister Robert Menzies.
Looks like he's turned down your proposal.
- May I use your telephone?
-Of course, in the hall.
The only reason why they sent Menzies is because America won't agree to help.
And now look.
Complete farce.
If Eisenhower wasn't running for re-election, the Americans would have stood by us a little more instead of hiding behind the United Nations and opening the door to Russia.
Perhaps the President knows something we don't.
Like how to win an election.
(CHUCKLING)
That was a very good point you made earlier, though.
Can you inform the Prime Minister that I'm trying to get a hold of him?
This country's become far too entrenched in what it thinks it's entitled to.
Perhaps it needs the likes of you and I to shake things up a bit.
- I'm off.
- All quiet?
Israel's becoming increasingly jumpy.
They don't like the Soviets in their backyard.
They'll be in Suez before us at this rate.
- I saw.
- Does Edith ever see you?
I pity that poor woman, Clarence.
I really do.
- And who should I pity, Lix?
- No one.
- That's the way I like it.
- Mr Kish gone?
No, not yet.
World Service speak very highly of him.
Well, his Arabic's brilliant.
Though I haven't found a single programme he's worked on in the eight years that he's been at the BBC.
Night-night.
Mr Kish.
Still here?
I'm just making final amendments to Nasser's rejection of Menzies' proposals.
Lix wanted it all down.
"What we have ever to do with ease, we must first do with diligence."
- So beautiful on the page.
- There are 28 basic letters.
It's the style that varies the form.
- It's remarkable.
- I think so, yes.
"Kish".
Hungarian?
Russian.
On my father's side.
Well, don't work too late.
I'll be off, then.
- Goodnight, Mr Wengrow.

(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

What are you doing here?
Eden's called an emergency meeting.
I may have to leave early.
Oh, we'll try not to miss you too much.
They're insisting everyone attends.
"They" again?
The mysterious "they".
"They" don't want you to know who "they" are, do they, Angus?
Have you read it?
Middle section.
"Adam Le Ray has all the charisma and threat of a carpetbagger.
"One can forgive Mr Le Ray most things, but a basic lack of talent
"is suspect in a man so devoid of anything else."
Well, I just did what you said.
And now the papers crucify me.
You need to get to bed.
Hector, take him up.
Yes, I think some sleep would do him good.
You said marry her and everything would be all right.
- Now she's dead.
- McCAIN:
Get him out.
- Freddie, could you...
- I'm all right.
I remember you now.
Get him out!
ADAM:
I did what you said!
- I'm going to be sick.
- What was he talking about?
God knows.
- What do you mean?
- Slap him.
Really?
Ah!
(LAUGHING)
Ow!
Bastards!
What the hell did you mean?
You did what he said.
Who?
Was it McCain?
- What did McCain tell you to do?
- Marry her.
- Marry her.
- Ruth?
(SHUSHING)
Sorry.
Well, you didn't think it was for love, did you?
- A girl in trouble and me.
- What?
If I married her, then no one would know what I am.
(SOBBING)
You should have bloody cared.
You should have bloody loved her!
Let him sleep it off.
Here.
- Is he all right?
- Why'd you let him get drunk like that?
Every time, Ralph!
- We were just having a bit of fun.
-Oh, yes, of course.
Always fun.
No.
Leave him.
Did you hear what he said?
These silent deals are struck all the time, Freddie.
- No.
- Then consider yourself fortunate.
One learns to recognise it.
A slow deadening in the eyes, acceptance of defeat.
I lived with the Elms family.
During the war.
On and off.
My mother, she worked as a secretary for Lord Elms, before she met my father.
They took me in during the Blitz, the odd summer, Christmas.
I hated shooting then.
I don't understand this world.
I've never understood it, how any of you live.
There lies the rub.
(GIGGLING) Have you seen them?

- Any of them.

It's a fair point but...
- It just jumps out at you.
-Mmm.
Like "Observe trotter night."
(LAUGHING)
Why would you marry someone you didn't love?
Are you asking?
Because you were lonely.
Because you had to.
- Because you were in trouble.
- Pregnant?
Is that...
That is what "trouble" means?
Poor, innocent boy.
Because you had something to hide?
Because there was a promise of a career at the end of it?
Because the person that you loved was doing something that they shouldn't?
Because the person you loved was a spy passing secrets?
Freddie, it's one o'clock in the morning.
"He knows.
"He knows, revert to Brightstone."
You need to sleep.
Good idea.
Not with me.
- Boring Moneypenny.
- And stop calling me that.
"I don't know what it is about you
"that closes and opens;

(SOBBING) Help!

- It's fine.
Stay.
He's all right.
Someone broke in last night and he's just a bit shaken up.
- Mrs B went over straight away.
- Ready?
Really.
Can you slow down a bit?
You know, you're very interesting to me, Mr Lyon.
I'd be more interesting alive than dead.
For all your socialist principles, no one does as well as you without help.
Can you please just...
You can let me out here.
I'll take the train.
Don't be ridiculous.
There's only one, it won't get you to London until the middle of next week.
You think you heard something last night.
Hmm.
What you actually heard were the drunk ramblings of an actor whose career is faltering at the starting gate.
I give The Man Who Knew a week.
I think you're wrong.
I think Adam Le Ray is a very interesting man with a lot to say for himself.
And I plan to listen.
And find out as much as I can.
I'm a big supporter of the spirit of enquiry.
A different time and I may well have offered you a job.
- Work with us, Freddie.
- I'd rather not.
The hours are appalling and the people are tedious.
I don't think it's privilege you dislike.
I think it's fear that in spite of it, you still won't be let in.
JEMIMA:
You'll drive carefully, won't you, darling?
We will, we will.
Come on, Ralph, let's get a move on.
Safe journey.
- Bye, my dears.
- Bye, Mummy.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Shall I take these?
- You really don't have to drive me.
- I insist.
Look after him.
Precious cargo.
Hmm.
Drive carefully.
Yes, do be careful, Hector.
Let's get you a cup of tea.
- What are you doing here?
- There was a break-in.
At my father's.
Good grief, I'm so sorry.
Is he all right?
He's sleeping.
I just needed to get out.
- Was anything taken?
- Nothing, except a photo of me with my mother.
What's your excuse?
Oh, dinner with a dreadful great-aunt,
I'm stalling for as long as I can, but...
The Egyptians have issued a new set of proposals.
Is Isaac in?
Somewhere, knee-deep in Pollock.
No, I can't put it off any longer.
She gets rather spiteful if I'm not by the entrée.
- Did he give you the film?
- No, he didn't.
He hasn't been seen all day, our Mr Kish.
Be careful, Freddie.
It's Sunday.
It looks sad.
Go home.
Or people will talk.
Are you going to say anything?
You haven't spoken the whole journey.
Bel, just say if you want this.

(LIFT BELL DINGS)
Did you break into my house last night, Mr Kish?
- Of course I didn't, Mr Lyon.
- You're lying.
You came into my house and you frightened my father.
Is that what you do?
Frighten people?
You've got a very active imagination, Mr Lyon.
I don't think so.
Who do you work for?
The same people you do, Mr Lyon.
Then why are you spying on me?
You look like you were very good friends.
With Ruth and Peter.
You must miss him.
I do.
Then why aren't you helping me?
I know you know something, something you're not telling me.
Why?
I could help you.
You can't help me.
You are an amateur, Mr Lyon.
You know nothing about me.
I know everything about you.
I know that you live with your father.
That you go to the laundrette on Wednesdays.
You have no luck with girls.
You work too much.
You don't know what you've got yourself into.
And now you know too much.
You're in the middle of a very dangerous world, but you've convinced yourself that you are somehow immune.
You're not.
We can do this one of two ways.
You can stop playing games with me and tell me everything that you know.
Gr?
(LOCK CLICKS)
You don't have to do this, Mr Kish.
Mr Kish?
"It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution."

If you kill me, you might not meet someone so interested in the truth.
I don't want to die in the bloody office!

Yes?
Yes, of course.
This is a surprise.
How awful.
Not at all.
Come on up.
It's the third floor.
(BUZZER)
(OPERATIC SINGING)
You could probably do with a drink.
Argh!
(YELPS)
Sykesy.
Coffee's on the table.
Ooh, and I meant to tell you.
I think I might have found a dog minder for Sykes.
Oh.
Millie Bullard, sister to the one and only George.
I er...wondered if you would ask him to put in a good word.
She's very particular so some serious sucking-up is required.
Message received.
(SYKES GRUNTS)
Is Ben back from his course today?
Yeah, he is.
The role-playing went down well, apparently.
(MOBILE RINGS) See you later.
Yeah.
Hello.
I'll be there right away.
Easy does it.
She's over there.
Morning, John.
Kids found her trapped in the weir.
Why are you um...
I was in the station when the call came in.
I thought it might have -
It's a false alarm.
Thank God for that.
Right, let's get her out.
You thought it might have been?
John, I've got a favour to ask.
Ask away.
I wouldn't bother you normally.
These things happen all the time.
A young adult goes off, doesn't bother telling her parents what she's doing.
Someone you know?
The daughter of some very old friends of mine.
The Olivers.
Jim and Mary.
Name's Lucy.
Lovely girl.
But she's just gone completely off the radar.
Have you heard of the Oblong Foundation?
Oh, the New Age people at Malham Hall.
Yeah.
The Obbies, as the locals call them.
Well, Lucy went on one of their induction courses for a week... ..and stayed five or six months.
Regular home calls to her mum and dad twice a week.
And then she just disappeared.
Not a word for two months now.
Jim hired a private detective who was meant to be an expert on cults.
But they fell out over money and he's no longer working for them.
They're desperate and I can understand why.
The spokesperson for the Oblong Foundation claims to have no knowledge of her whereabouts.
I'll check it out.
I appreciate it, John.
And if there's anything I can do...
What?
Um...
It's nothing.
What?
(DOGS BARK)
WOMAN:
Quiet!
Morning.
This is John Barnaby.
Miss Bullard.
Pleased to meet you.
Millie.
Where's Sykes?
I was introducing you to John Barnaby.
It's pointless if I don't meet the dog.
(PHONE RINGS AND DOGS BARK)
Come in, come in.
Quiet!
Yes?
Oh, hello.
Look, there are plenty of other dog minders about.
Nothing has altered since yesterday and I don't envisage anything changing for months.
Outside!
(FRANTIC BARKING)
No.
No.
No.
My sister's always been forthright.
But she's normally straightforward to deal with.
She hasn't put you out in the garden before?
Er, no.
How long have the Oblong people been at Malham Hall?
Getting on for a couple of years.
Ruth Lambert inherited the place from her parents who died in a boating accident.
You may have heard of them.
Property developer and his wife.
Oh, I remember.
It was a gas explosion, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Ruth was a member of the Oblong Foundation.
You're not suggesting there's a connection?
No evidence of foul play.
The coroner was unequivocal.
Accidental death.
But it has proved quite convenient for the foundation.
(DOOR OPENS)
I'll have the file sent over in case there's something.
I do apologise about all that.
Come in.
I'm afraid George has wasted your time, Mr Barnaby.
I need to see you and Sykes together so if the two of you could come back tomorrow, say about midday.
No problem.
Ah, perfect.
See you tomorrow.
Bye, George.
My sister.
We have no idea where your daughter is.
I'm sure she'll be in touch.
LAD:
Where's Lucy?
Weirdos.
Where is she?
Freaks.
Stop that.
Tree huggers.
Stop.
It's not helping.
Perhaps you should look to yourselves first.
Dominic, I'll handle it.
You cannot force us to leave.
Everybody stop now, please.
If you're not on your way within three seconds
I will be doing you for assault.
What, with a dangerous egg?
Three... two... (MOUTHS)
Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby, Causton CID.
Who's in charge?
Freddie Raft.
Freddie, if you wait inside I'll be with you shortly.
Mr and Mrs Oliver.
We need to talk.
We've heard nothing.
Neither have any of Lucy's friends.
It's totally out of character.
Do you know if her phone or credit cards have been used?
We tried to find out but they say it's all confidential.
They refuse to tell us anything.
The press have been in touch, talking about doing a story and...using her picture.
We're not keen but...
I don't know what else we can do.
They've agreed to no more demos for two weeks.
In return I was hoping you might tell me about the circumstances of Lucy's disappearance.
Departure.
She hasn't disappeared.
She didn't tell you where she was going, what she was doing?
No.
But even if she had I'd be unable to tell her parents without her permission.
Or you.
We take confidentiality very seriously.
Freddie, I'm telling you, in a friendly way, that if you hear from Lucy you will call me.
I don't need to know where she is just that she's OK.
Do you understand?
And if you need to talk to anyone, can you do it through me, please?
Who's that?
Thank you, yes.
Just lay them out.
That's Ruth and Dominic.
Dominic's our inspirational teacher.
Ruth's the owner of Malham Hall.
She's a long-standing member of the foundation.
Thank you.
WOMAN:
They're pretty harmless as cults go.
Harmless?
The Lamberts would be spinning in their graves if they knew what was happening.
Mind control, psychological manipulation.
And then there's the nudity and the orgies.
And the ritualised flagellations.
Not all bad then, what?
We get the odd absconder down here, desperate for a drink.
But the fun police from the hall arrive and round them up.
They've got an uncanny of knowing when they're here.
Lucy Oliver was here the night before she disappeared.
Well, that's why the chief inspector's here, isn't it?
Lucy Oliver's disappearance.
Did she say where she was going?
No word about going anywhere.
But that Freddie woman got down here a bit quick and the chat they had was...
..intense.
You didn't hear what they were discussing?
No.
But when Lucy left that was the last we saw of her.
Some have been suspicious of the Obbies from the start.
The previous owners of Malham Hall died in a boating accident.
Mm.
A few conspiracy theorists still believe that it wasn't an accident.
Retired property developer Jeremy Lambert and his wife, Carolyn, died last night when their classic river cruiser exploded as the result of a gas leak.
The couple, who were experienced boaters, had spent the evening at a local restaurant where fellow diners said they had enjoyed a quiet meal together.
The National Boat Owner's Association said the accident is a tragic reminder of the importance of gas safety procedures on pleasure craft, particularly older boats with aging equipment.
Police have asked for anyone that was in the area at the time of the incident to con-
What did you make of the Obbies?
We'll be lucky to find out anything at all.
Shame that her parents fell out with the private detective.
He'd done all the hard work.
Establishing a false ID, getting a pass for the induction week.
Afternoon.
Ooh.
Very Miami Vice.
Just part of the role-play.
This is funny.
This is extraordinary.
The name the private detective was going to go undercover with was Jones.
What age was he?
Same age as Ben.
A girl has gone missing from the Oblong Foundation.
How about going undercover on one of their induction courses?
No, I've got a week off, sir.
I need it.
I just...
I just popped in to -
I think this is what is called an amazing opportunity.
Intelligence-gathering skills, you see.
The course has not been in vain.
And um...it wouldn't do your promotion prospects any harm either.
That is undue pressure, sir.
The missing girl is the daughter of some good friends of George's.
Seriously, Ben.
Have a look at that.
We're extremely worried about what's happened to her.
Her disappearance does feel iffy.
Yeah.
How does Ben feel about it all?
Oh, he can handle himself.
Oh, having said that, playing the part of his undercover identity will be a test.
Burnt out media whizz kid from Crouch End. (CHUCKLES)
Anyway, we've got our interview with Millie and we'll both have to be on our best behaviour.
I've heard that.
Oh, no problem.
Sykesy will charm her, won't you, boy?
(BARKS)
(GROWLS SOFTLY)
Perfect...imperfection.
The grit...in a pure voice... which gives the song that extra lift of emotion.
The extra inch on a waistline... ..that proclaims a joy in sensual pleasure...
..and the appetite for it.
Are not these things... more beautiful than the purest beauty itself?
And the planet Earth.
Our very home.
But it's not a sphere.
It is...
Oblong.
Oblong.
A spinning oblong, wobbling and tilting on its axis in its oblong orbit around the sun.
Imperfect fireball.
A ragged, life-giving globe of flame.
All imperfections, granting so many possibilities and bringing so much of what is unique and beautiful to life, to our lives.
And so, being here this week, you are invited... to be a part of that cosmic imperfection.
Hm?
And to glory in it... ..knowingly.
(MOBILE RINGTONE)
Oh.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.
God, how excruciatingly embarrassing.
Right, there we are.
I've done it.
Sorry.
The siren call of new technology.
Oh, tell me about it.
(SHARPLY) Yes.
Thank you.
So, I think... ..that this is probably a good time to invite you all to make your last phone call of the week and then all mobiles will be handed in.
It is one of the few rules that we have here at Malham Hall.
Thank you.
He didn't mention the free love like they did on the website.
I hope we're not here under false pretences.
Oh, you've made a friend there.
Blaze Leadbetter.
Cosmo Jones.
Ooh, Cosmo.
I like.
That's typical of me, the whole phone thing.
Persona non grata and we've not even started.
It could have happened to anyone.
Thank you.
Well, I'd er...better make my call.
Oh, yes, of course.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Hey, Wolf.
Here, boy.
Do you know, was there once a pontoon here?
There was, yeah.
Partially destroyed when a boat blew up two or three years ago.
And they never rebuilt it.
Must have been quite an explosion.
It was a big bang.
You were here when it happened?
Are you a copper?
Thought so.
I can spot one at a hundred yards.
I can spot a hash plant at twenty.
Hey, Wolf.
Come on.
Wolf.
Come on, boy.
I'm not interested in plants but I am interested in what happened on the night of the explosion.
No-one was interested in what I had to say at the time.
Yes, I found a comment in the case notes.
It said you seemed to be high during pretty much all of your waking hours.
Yeah.
It doesn't mean you don't hear things.
I think that was his point.
What did you hear, exactly?
I was down below.
I didn't see anything.
But I heard footsteps on the pontoon.
(FOOTSTEPS)
I thought it was the Lamberts returning at first.
They didn't come down to their boat often but I had seen them earlier that day.
But then I heard the footsteps going back again so I realised that it couldn't have been them.
What about the explosion?
I was on deck for that.
(DISTANT LAUGHTER)
Ooh.
Enjoyable meal?
Excellent, thanks.
'Night.
Good night.
(MOBILE RINGS)
Yes?
'I saw Carolyn answer her phone.'
Who's this?
'Just when she got back on board.'
Oh, wait a moment, can you?
'Then a few moments later just...'
It was obvious they were both dead.
(MOBILE RINGS)
Excuse me.
Jones.
They're not keen on mobile phones.
I'll be hiding mine, handing in the spare, so I'm not sure how easy it's going to be to keep in touch.
Well, if you get anything on Lucy Oliver tell me as soon as you can but don't push it.
Concentrate on fitting in for now.
You never mentioned the inductees have to sleep in a dormitory.
Yeah.
Go easy on the free love.
They're a bit scary, to be honest.
England expects, Jones.
Got an interesting... (SOFT CONVERSATION) (RUSTLE OF FOOTSTEPS)
Yeah, bye.
I was just looking for somewhere to hide mine.
Depriving us of our mobile phones.
It's against our human rights.
That is just for emergencies, obviously.
Absolutely.
Do you think mine could share that nice little sleeping bag with yours?
Yeah.
A friend of mine told me about the course.
It changed her life.
But then she's always been a bit out there.
Yeah, I heard it's pretty awesome.
They're not perfect though.
When she was here a couple of the foundation regulars had a blazing row.
Yeah.
One of them walked out, just disappeared one night.
Very weird.
Right.
So do you know who was involved?
It was Freddie, I think, the woman who runs it and the younger one.
What was her name?
I think it was Lucy.
Nice girl, apparently.
Just upped and left.
Didn't say goodbye.
Is that right?
Apparently.
Did your friend say what the row was about?
I've no idea.
She said it was still a good week though but I think I'll take a bit more convincing before I commit to the Oblong way.
Bit of a sceptic.
Best way.
Listen...
I er...
I've got to make one last call.
Then I'll see you up there.
(DISTANT CONVERSATION)
Oh.
Beautiful here, isn't it?
Ohh.
I like to explore new places, get my bearings, know where I am.
Well, we all need to know where we are.
It's um...
Cosmo, isn't it?
That's right.
Wise words... ..from a wise man, I think.
Maybe a bit wasted on an advertiser copywriter.
Will you walk with us...copywriter?
Of course.
Yeah.
There's a DCI John Barnaby asking to see you, Miss Crane.
Mr Barnaby.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
It's an informal visit.
Oh, dear.
That normally means you'll be asking for information I shouldn't really give out.
You've seen through me straightaway.
(CHUCKLES)
Well, I suppose the worst I can do is say no.
I'll try my luck then.
I understand Ruth Lambert is a client of yours as were her parents when they were alive.
You were executor of their wills.
That's correct.
There's a missing persons case I'm looking into informally, a Lucy Oliver, and I was hoping to get some background about the Oblong Foundation and their set-up at Malham Hall with Ruth.
As far as I'm concerned everything's above board.
The foundation is renting Malham Hall on a short-term tenancy agreement from Ruth.
That's it.
Did you know the Lamberts well?
Can I ask what this has to do with Lucy Oliver's disappearance?
I was going to ask what your feelings were about the boating accident.
You think they're connected?
I'm just trying to get a feel for the general background.
General background - ah, I see.
For what it's worth I was in the 'accident waiting to happen' camp.
I'd been on the Lambert's boat.
They didn't turn the gas off at the bottle.
They didn't even turn it off at the secondary valve.
And with Carolyn smoking...
An accident waiting to happen.
That's me.
There you are.
Thank you.
Your mobile will be here on the last afternoon of the course.
Ruth.
If you could just sign here.
There's a registered letter for you at the post office.
I offered to sign but the postman insisted on getting your signature.
RUTH:
I don't like this.
Go sooner rather than later but take someone with you.
I could go with her.
If the villagers cause trouble I'll give 'em a bit of that.
I think actually it's more diplomacy we're looking for.
What about Cosmo?
Don't you think one of the family rather than an inductee?
He'll be fine.
This is the...village post office.
Yeah.
If there's any trouble just diffuse it.
And you can do that, copywriter.
I feel the calm in him.
Oh, no.
They're the ones who were causing the trouble.
Look who this is.
Spot the weirdos.
Look, it's the tree huggers.
So where's Lucy, eh?
I'm sorry about this.
Where is she?
Under the patio?
What have you done with her?
Freaks.
Don't ignore us.
Ow.
Oi.
Argh.
Are you shy or something?
Why can't you face us?
Oi.
Go on.
Stop.
Answer the question.
We wanna know.
Where's Lucy?
Look at the bozo.
Freak.
That's enough.
'Ey up.
He's going to let the dog loose on us.
You two again.
Throw another one of those and you'll be on a community order picking up litter for the next few years.
Could I have a word, please, sir?
Nice to see you keeping a low profile, Cosmo.
I spoke to someone who confirms Freddie and Lucy fell out.
Massive row.
The next morning she was gone.
They asked me to come with Ruth Lambert in case there was trouble.
That's her.
She's picking up a registered letter.
Call me.
Oh, my God.
What's happened?
Local village idiots, I'm afraid.
More than our fair share here.
So, you won't be pressing charges then, sir?
Well, if there's another incident like this then I'll have to re-evaluate.
Those my tomatoes?
Right, you'll be paying double for that lot.
I didn't realise you worked here as well.
Here during the day, pub evenings and weekends.
That's a long week.
Yes, well, some of us weren't born with a silver spoon in our mouths.
Right, that'll be ã10, please.
Yeah?
I don't think so.
Do you want me to go round and ask your dad for it?
It's up to you.
They're getting so confrontational.
Pretty good shots too.
I'm sorry.
Mm, Mr Barnaby.
Ah.
And who's this?
This young fella is Sykes.
Oh, hello.
He's a bit nervous.
We've got an interview with Millie Bullard in half an hour.
Oh, we know Millie.
Many are interviewed.
Few are chosen.
Well, I think Sykes might need a bit of fortifying for his ordeal ahead.
Bo's going to have to share her snack this morning.
Go on then.
Short rations, Bo.
Claire.
Yeah?
Phone.
Oh, OK.
Hang on one sec.
Well, listen...good luck.
Thank you.
Paddy is obviously run off his feet.
You know, the Lamberts used to have lunch here quite a lot.
I don't think Claire was very pleased when Paddy barred them.
It's still very busy here in the evenings.
Claire's reputation from her old catering business.
What did the Lamberts do to get barred?
He doesn't like the idea of serving anyone, Paddy.
So, when you've got the Lamberts, who thought they owned the place, well... ..it was always going to be a rocky road.
(FRANTIC BARKING)
MILLIE:
Quiet!
Sykesy, could you keep it down just a touch?
Mr Barnaby...and Sykes.
Do come in.
I did love my mum and dad.
I just had to get out of that place when I was old enough.
Such a huge house with just two or three people in it.
It seemed so wasteful.
Now though, with the foundation, it feels so right.
But there are still a lot of memories there for me.
Those kids in the village were... going on about a Lucy Oliver...weren't they?
I heard she had a row with Freddie before she went missing.
That's not true.
They were really good friends.
Well, I always take second-hand comments with a pinch of salt.
Better to trust your instincts, I say.
That's what Dominic always says.
The logic of trusting your instincts.
I think Dominic has really taken to you.
I think maybe I have as well.
A little.
(BARKING)
He's normally very calm.
A bit excited.
What have found out about the Oliver girl, about her curious disappearance?
Did you know there's a footpath that runs through the Malham Hall estate?
I didn't.
Oh, yes.
They've always been relaxed about people walking their dogs there but just recently they've put up notices... asking owners to keep their dogs on a lead.
I'll leave you to draw your own conclusion.
Leave.
(BARKING)
A bit of trouble down in the village, was it?
Ruth said you were magnificent.
I can't argue with that.
Did you want a shower?
Oh, yes, all right.
No, no, no, it's OK.
Just finishing.
Shame.
I happen to know Freddie's going to London tonight.
Staying over.
You're very interested in Freddie.
Well, it's our once-only chance to look at her room.
I want to find out a little bit more about the foundation before I pledge my undying loyalty.
How did it go?
I'm in here.
So...do we have a dog minder?
She is prepared to give Sykes a trial.
Ah.
A trial?
Mm.
And she wants to meet the other pack leader.
That's you.
What happened?
It was fine.
She says the only way she can get a handle on Sykes' personality is if she meets us both.
It went well.
There was no inappropriate behaviour?
No leg mounting?
None.
And Sykes behaved himself?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
I suppose it'll all be worth it.
Dominic will address you.
From the time of the Anglo-Saxon roundhouses, communal sleeping was the norm.
People slept not just with their family... but with their tribe.
This is the Oblong way for our inductees.
But, if people do need their own space... for coitus, then love rooms are available in the adjoining corridor.
And can I ask that all inductees observe the protocol of the 'do not disturb' signs?
So, good night, one and all.
You're in there, mate.
Wh- (Don't look so worried.
It's not a proposition.)
(We just go out, pretend we're going to the love room and then, when the coast is clear, nip over to Freddie's.)
OK.
(Take my hand.)
We've got to look the part.
Here.
Hello there.
Room for a little one?
We're strictly 'do not disturb'.
Oh.
It's not really in the spirit of things.
Sorry, mate.

(HEAVY THUDDING) It's making me feel a bit funny.
I think the coast must be clear by now.

Look through the drawers.
(PHONE RINGS)
What if someone comes and answers it?
(DISTANT DOOR OPENS) DOMINIC:
It just be important.
I'll be right back, butterfly.
(RINGING CONTINUES)
What's happening?
Yes, go on.
What did they say?
Right.
OK, I understand that.
They can't prove there's been a murder if they can't produce a body.
Oh, fine.
Freddie, I don't think that you should leave your door unlocked.
Mm.
OK, talk soon then.
Bye.
It's locked.
No.
(MOBILE BUZZES)
(BUZZING CONTINUES)
Hello.
Hi...matey.
I'm in a bit of a sticky situation here.
Matey?
Yeah.
I've got someone with me and we're in a bit of a pickle.
(LOW CONVERSATION)
Doesn't sound promising.
Yeah.
We're two storeys up and I don't know how we're going to get out.
OK.
Um...
This is what we're going to do.

About time.
Talk about hogging love room number three.
I'm quite sure he'll fit in.
You can pick him up any time up until eight o'clock.
About seven?
Perfect.
Time to introduce Sykes to his new chums.
Say goodbye, Sykes.
You be good.
There's no alternative at this establishment.
Seven o'clock then.
OK.
A magical tree.
The willow.
Now one branch, separated from the mother tree, will regenerate itself if it's planted in soil... close to life-giving water.
You, you are all branches of your own family trees.
And we are, all of us, a part of the tree of life.
In the moment, attached to the past and through us... ..the sap of future growth.
If our spirits are not free, we are but wood on the bough.
Be your own tree.
ALL:
Be your own tree.
Be your own tree.
Be your own tree.
(DISTANT) Be your own tree.
(DISTANT) Be your own tree.
Will you just look at them?
Huh.
Not even going to work at this time of year.
Symbolic, apparently.
Yeah.
Now... thrust it home firmly... so that it may thrive and put down roots... and its body may grow and its limbs reach towards the heavens.
Let the Oblong Foundation... be your fertile ground.
Let us provide the nutrients for your growth... ..and the full realisation of your potential.
Wow.
I can really feel your spiritual energy.
It's so strong.
Can you feel anything from me?
Er...
I think that's a yes.
You two, you have a natural bond, I think.
The process has begun.
Ruth Lambert has asked me to co-operate fully with you... regarding giving you details of her parents' financial situation.
When it comes to the Oblong Foundation she says there really is nothing to explain.
Fair enough.
As executor of the Lamberts' will...
I discovered that there had been a number of cash withdrawals over the years from their accounts amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds.
As the family lawyer, I mentioned the possibility of accusations of inheritance tax avoidance to Ruth.
You thought they were evading tax?
No, it was something that happened, oh, about 18 months before the accident that I mentioned to Ruth and she thought I should mention to you.
Mention away.
Jeremy Lambert was thinking about lending some money and he wanted to know the legally binding nature of an IOU.
I said a promissory note would provide the best protection.
I even offered to draft one for him but he said they were just thinking about it at this stage.
One or two months later he said he'd changed his mind.
This wasn't mentioned in the case reports.
Well, it wasn't relevant.
The explosion was an accident and our position was that, when there was a significant withdrawal of cash, the money had gone on gambling.
That's a lot of flutters.
Indeed.
I told Carolyn they'd missed last orders for food one evening and they were upset.
Told us what very special customers they were and how they deserved special service.
I said if you don't like the service go elsewhere cos I don't want you around here.
And the pub's all the better for it.
I'm financially secure enough not to have to worry about the custom from people like the Lamberts.
Paddy, is there any chance that you can change the gas bottle?
Oh, hello.
Claire's doing a big barbecue at the weekend.
Likes to be prepared, don't you, my love?
I don't want to run out.
You want to mind what you say.
Mr Barnaby's reinvestigating the deaths of the Lamberts.
Anyone handy with that kind of thing will be on his list of suspects.
I'm not so sure about that.
There's a major difference between barbecues, which are out in the open, and boats - enclosed airtight spaces... in which leaking gas collects like water in a pond.
I think the chief inspector's more likely to be interested in those with a knowledge of leisure craft rather than barbecues, like you and me.
The difference being I didn't have anything against the Lamberts - unlike some people.
Well, the two of us hate boats.
Avoid them at all costs, don't we, love?
Yeah, we're not their biggest fans.
Do you know of anyone locally who may have borrowed money from the Lamberts?
Borrowed money?
I think that's a bit unlikely.
They were good at spending on themselves but tight when it came to other people.
They owned half the village but I don't recall them buying a round.
Not bad tippers though.
(MOBILE RINGS) Feudal throwbacks.
Excuse me.
Jones, how's it going?
When I was trapped in Freddie's room
I heard Dominic on the phone saying something like,
'They can't prove she's been murdered if they don't find a body.'
Did you get the impression there was a body?
Difficult to say.
Listen, things are getting a bit...
What's happened?
This Ruth girl is getting very trusting and I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable with it.
Not going native on me, are you, Jones?
She's vulnerable, sir.
She's been telling me about her parents' death and how difficult she found coping with it.
She's put all of their stuff in an outbuilding till she can face sorting it out.
Have you seen it?
No, it's all locked away.
TANNOY:
Our network session is due to start in five minutes.
Battery's going.
Is Freddie back?
I haven't seen her yet.
Listen...
I've got to go.
Who were you calling?
Don't you trust me, Cosmo?
TANNOY:
This is your last call for the social network session starting in five minutes.
So, 8:30 on the 5th.
Table for ten.
Wonderful.
See you then.
Bye.
Oh.
Forgot to take a deposit.
Well, I'm sure they'll turn up.
We're not booked up anyway so it doesn't matter.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes, I'm fine.
Absolutely fine.
You don't think mentioning about boats and how we didn't...
like them...
You don't think that sounded a little defensive?
Paddy, it was an accident.
That DCI doesn't seem to think so.
Everyone knows I didn't get on with the Lamberts.
You and several dozen other people.
So what?
You're right.
TANNOY:
Embrace your fellow students and gain strength from their imperfection.
Keep an eye on him.
TANNOY:
But each spirit will be free so we must move on to a new cluster.
We will honour and respect the real you.
Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby, Causton CID.
I need to speak to Ruth Lambert.
Actually, Freddie deals with all our enquiries and she's not here at the moment.
Isn't it up to Ruth?
Isn't personal responsibility what the Oblong Foundation is all about?
TANNOY:
Gain strength and move on.
If you don't want to speak to the police without Freddie here that's your prerogative.
I would like someone present.
Would you mind?
No problem.
TANNOY:
Our spirit is refreshed as we embrace our imperfection.
Has my solicitor been helpful?
She said you were looking into the deaths of my parents again.
She has and we appreciate your co-operation.
I was never really sure about the coroner's verdict.
I'd never have got through it without the foundation.
Dominic and Freddie were fantastic.
Well, there's a lot to sort out.
Practical stuff as much as anything.
I couldn't do any of that.
I put Mum and Dad's stuff in one of old outbuildings.
Is that right?
Do you think I could... have a look at your parents' things?
Are their personal papers here?
Some.
All the financial stuff went to the solicitor.
She was trying to cut down but there were certain things she couldn't do without a cigarette.
Having a drink and socialising were the toughest.
And the telephone.
She couldn't have a phone conversation without lighting up.
Couldn't do it.
Do you um... do you have your mother's old mobile phone number?
I'll just be a couple of minutes.
Mother's mobile phone number?
Call me.
I can't.
My battery's gone dead.
All right.
Meet on footpath by the river tomorrow morning at seven.
Sir.
I just need a phone number from Ruth and then I'm done.
Thank you for your co-operation.
I'm really beginning to get the vibe now.
That last session was bang on.
Respect the real you, respect the real other.
Hang on.
Totty alert.
Three o'clock.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
I was thinking...
I'm not quite ready for the day to end... and I was wondering if you'd like to spend some time with me.
Nice outfit.
So why all the interest in the parents' stuff?
Do you think they were murdered?
Not sure.
But I can see a way it could have been done now.
If whoever it was knew about Carolyn's smoking habits -
Oh.
Sykes, here.
Sykesy.
Day two with his minder.
He'll be looking like a mud rat.
Sykes!
A smoking habit?
Whoever it was could have gone on to the Lamberts' boat, loosened the gas tube to the cooker and made sure that the gas was turned on at the bottle then waited.
All they had to do was phone Carolyn's mobile as she got on board knowing that she wouldn't be able to talk... without lighting up.
Boom.
It would explain why they never found any kind of remote detonator.
The near-perfect crime.
But the person with the biggest motive would be your new girlfriend.
(GROANS)
She propositioned me last night.
Oh.
Oh, I didn't do anything but...it's doing my head in.
She is unlikely to be the murderer.
She put us on to her mum's compulsive 'lighting up on the phone' habit.
Perhaps Lucy discovered something about the death of the Lamberts and that's why she disappeared.
I don't think there's anything more to find out about Lucy, sir.
What I overheard Dominic saying doesn't mean they killed her.
They're worried other people will blame them.
It doesn't mean there's a body.
Oh, my God.
I think perhaps you should stay... at least until I've had this identified.
Hi.
How are you doing?
A bit hurt, to be honest.
A bit wounded in the pride department.
But I had really good dreams last night though.
Did you have good dreams?
Yeah.
You know, the fact you asked us to wait last night, well, it just makes me all the more sure about you.
I won't take no for an answer tonight though.
(I think you've pulled.)
Hi, Blaze.
Are you in a good place today?
Oh, yeah.
Uber, uber good.
It's basically a forum, an opportunity for people to feed back their experience of the week.
Ah, just in time for roll call.
You'll have to take it yourself.
Why, what's happened?
I'll join you in a minute.
Freddie.
We'll be unmasking an imposter.
We all like to make the most of ourselves.
The well-cut suit that flatters the figure of a gentleman.
And ladies who enjoy the benefits that a good lift-and-separate bra has to offer.
But, for me, I finally decided
I'm more Bruce Willis than Arthur Scargill.
I'm finally being my own me.
Being my own tree.
ALL CHANT:
Be your own tree.
Be your own tree.
Be your own tree.
Be your own tree.
Now, not everyone here is... being as honest about who they are.
We have an imposter in our midst.
Oh, yes.
Yeah, Freddie has been in London trying to persuade a certain tabloid newspaper not to put out... a very negative story about us.
And she has discovered that one of you... ..is not who you say you are.
But before Freddie returns to reveal which one of you is a tabloid journalist,
you have a brief opportunity... to be honest with us.
(MUTTERING)
What?
Blaze... ..are you researching this story for a national newspaper?
I've been trying to discover the truth about what happened to Lucy Oliver.
Do you have a problem with that?
Traitor.
Yeah?
Yeah, well, I'm not the only imposter here.
Because there's a private detective in our midst, investigating her disappearance as well.
Yeah.
And he is right here.
Yeah, because the Olivers told me.
Traitor.
(HUBBUB)
Just...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Lucy?
Freddie's dead.
It's OK, it's OK.
Traitor.
Shame on you.
Please, stay where you are.
Back off.
I'm a police officer.
Please.
Lucy, it's OK.
Come on.
Come with me.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Dominic.
Is she dead?
She is.
I was staying with a friend in London getting my head together.
Freddie kept sending me these emails.
I didn't reply to any.
What were the emails about?
She wanted me to get in touch with my mum and dad.
Talking about some tabloid story that was going to be published suggesting that I was dead and how the foundation had something to do with it.
Why didn't you get in touch with your parents?
I don't know.
It's just...
(DISTANCE CAR ENGINE)
Lucy, you had a row with Freddie the night before you left.
Is that right?
What was it that caused the row?
You know that Freddie and I were having a physical relationship?
Go on.
One evening I let myself into Freddie's room to surprise her... ..and I found her...
..counting money on the bed... ..loads of it, with the safe open behind her.
What's this?
You should have knocked.
You said it was a non-profit-making organisation.
I thought that any profits you made went to charity.
They do.
Some of them.
Obviously we have to consider our own financial security.
This is a bit more than financial security.
That's thousands and thousands of pounds.
Don't be naive, Lucy, darling.
I couldn't believe it.
You mentioned a safe.
It was right there.
Sir.
Do you have any idea who might know the combination?
Oh, sorry.
OK.
Your parents would like to see you.
I'll take her down.
Good to see you, Lucy.
Thanks.
And you.
Possible financial motive, do you think?
Any surprises?
Time of death minutes before the body was discovered.
Quarter of an hour max.
Which would give everyone in the barn an alibi.
What about Lucy?
Oh, she had nothing to do with it, I'm 99% certain.
Do you still want me to analyse the bones you found?
Did you happen to notice whether they were human?
Spare rib of pork.
Picnic barbecue I should think.
Ohh!
Don't you dare tell me you were just doing your job.
Ben...can you leave this to me, please?
You had an undercover police officer here.
What was he doing?
You know we were concerned about Lucy's disappearance.
And you were so right about that, weren't you?
I need to ask if either of you know the combination to the safe in Freddie's bedroom.
The safe?
It was robbery?
We don't know.
Opening the safe could tell us.
I have no idea.
Freddie dealt with all that.
I didn't even know the safe existed until Freddie found it.
Freddie definitely knew the combination because Lucy saw her with the safe open.
I know she worked it out.
She showed me what was inside.
Would you mind if I spoke to Ruth privately?
What was in the safe?
Quite a lot of money and gold sovereigns and documents.
What documents?
I asked Freddie to deal with them.
I couldn't face it and Freddie was good at all that financial stuff.
It would have been useful if you'd mentioned the safe when we spoke before.
None of the contents were included in the estate so I...
I thought it best not to.
Did Freddie tell you how she managed to open it?
I gave her all our birth dates.
She thought they'd be worth trying because they used mine for the burglar alarm.
But she didn't crack it straight away.
She asked me about other numbers they might have used.
It took her a couple of days.
Could you do something for me?
Could you write down the birth dates for yourself and your parents and any other numbers you might have given to Freddie.
Any car registration numbers, phone numbers.
It was a while ago.
This may well help us identify Freddie's murderer.
And if your parents were murdered as well, which I think they were, it'll be their murderer too.
One last thing.
I understand you received a registered letter recently.
Who was it from?
It was from Mr Oliver.
He was asking if I knew anything about Lucy, where she was.
I didn't.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
You were really good, you know that?
You totally took me in.
I don't think Detective Sergeant Jones took advantage of you as much as he might have done.
I know that because he told me how uncomfortable he was with the situation.
Can I go now, please?
You can go.
Mr Oliver would like to take Lucy home now.
She needs a change of clothing.
Just keep us informed if she wants to go anywhere.
Er...thank you.
What did Ruth say, sir?
She confirms Lucy's story.
The safe was full of money and gold coins.
All part of the inheritance tax avoidance.
But I also think it's possible that the identity of our murderer is in there as well.
How's that, sir?
I think the Lamberts lent money to somebody.
Avoiding paying them back could have been the motive for their murders.
If the IOU was in the safe and Freddie found it it could be why she was murdered too.
The question is whether it has now been removed.
Do we know what the loan was for?
No, just that it was kept very secret for some reason.
Lucy.
Trust the real you.
(FRUSTRATED GROAN)
We could try them all backwards.
I don't understand why Ruth didn't know anything about the safe and combination.
You think she's lying?
No, I don't but...
Could there have been a clue in the will, perhaps?
I wonder if Ruth would have a copy.
We could ask her.
All right, give it a try.
Me.
If you're worried I could have a go.
No, no, no.
It's...fine.
I'm sure it's here somewhere.
I'm sorry about Freddie.
We had no idea it was going to happen.
Sad that we met the way we did.
For a while I thought it might have been the...real thing.
Ah.
I suppose once I give you this you'll have got all you need from me and we'll be able to go our separate ways.
Ruth, Ruth.
I'm sorry we met the way we did as well.
Broken.
Can't be mended.
Shame but there we are.
Sir.
Sir, I think we've got something.
Freddie asked to see the will and it looks like there is a clue in it.
Tell me.
My parents weren't at all religious but they included a line in the will which I thought was odd when I read it.
We leave our daughter wealthy in material terms but want to remind her that she'll be safe with the gift she received when she first entered the church.
Baptism.
Do you remember the date?
A question Freddie asked.
My parents always made a point of telling me that I was baptised one month to the day after I was born.
The fifth... of the sixth... '81.
Apparently Lucy's not a suspect despite being covered in the poor woman's blood.
Putting her parents through hell.
Two months, was it?
I think it's because they're not able to come to terms with her sexuality.
Punishing them.
Or because they were right about the Obbies.
A parent can do almost nothing worse than be right in circumstances like that, uh?
Mm.
A template for some kind of confidentiality agreement and a tenancy agreement for Malham Hall but no promissory note.
If someone got into the safe, would they just take the promissory note, not the cash and the gold sovereigns?
It does seem unlikely.
In which case, if there's no promissory note here there's no evidence there ever was one so we are back to square one.
Standard form.
Downloaded, just as you might download a standard template for a promissory note... if you didn't want to involve your solicitor.
Did your parents have a computer?
You think someone murdered my parents to get out of paying a loan back?
I'm wondering whether Freddie found the paperwork in the safe.
Perhaps she didn't mention it to you because she decided she could use it in some way herself.
She'd have told me if she found evidence that someone had murdered my parents.
At the time, 18 months ago, everyone thought your parents death had been an accident but that changed when it became public knowledge that I was re-examining the case.
Then the person with the forgotten debt would no longer just look lucky.
They'd suddenly have a big motive...
for killing your parents.
Freddie would have been the only one who knew about it.
OK, try searching for... promissory or IOU.
Two files.
Try the more recent.
Would an unsigned computer document be valid in court, sir?
The witness's name is there for a reason.
Try his number.
If he confirms the veracity of the document it'll be admissible.
Thank you, Ruth.
We'll be in touch.
Detective Sergeant Jones, Causton CID.
I'd like to speak a Mr Max Fuller, please.
I see.
Can you tell me what the circumstances were?
The date.
Get the date.
Do you know what date it was when this happened?
OK, thank you.
I'll call you back.
He was stabbed to death at his flat.
Sounds like an aggravated burglary.
It was the night of the boating accident.
And the killer was never apprehended.
No.
I think it's time they were.
(BUZZES)
What have Claire's old invoices got to do with anything?
A catering job that Claire did for the Lamberts three-and-a-bit years ago on their boat.
She could have learned enough about the gas system to make an explosion.
Don't be ridiculous.
Claire?
(DISTANT CONVERSATION)
..which is how, 18 months later, she got into the boat so easily to access the gas system.
You weren't entirely truthful when you said you were financially secure.
You had no money to speak of when you met Claire.
She produced the money for the pub and it was borrowed from the Lamberts.
And when you barred the Lamberts from the pub they wanted their money back.
No, no, no.
You're totally wrong.
That was her savings.
You're totally wrong.
She'll tell you.
She's probably out in the garden.
I'll get her.
Claire?
Claire!
She would have told me.
Why wouldn't she tell me?
(DOOR CREAKS)
Sir.
Claire?
(FAINT HISSING)
Stay where you are.
(HISSES)
What are you doing?
Paddy, I really mean it.
Paddy, stay still.
There's enough gas in here to cause quite a bang.
So... you killed the Lamberts?
And Freddie.
And a man called Max Fuller.
You know about Max?
I'm impressed.
His name was on the promissory note.
How many copies of that were there?
It was on the Lamberts' laptop.
Max Fuller was the witness to the contract and, once the Lamberts were dead, the last person left who knew about the loan.
One thing I don't understand is why the Lamberts were so willing to bankroll the pub.
The last tenants made a mess of it and it looked like it would close.
They auditioned you on the boat.
They had a couple of friends down from London.
'The Lamberts had tasted my cooking at a local event...'
Smelling good down there.
'..and wanted me to take over the pub.'
They lent me the 85 grand on the condition that no-one,
not even my own husband, was to know about it.
Because the money came from the secret hoard they were stashing away to avoid inheritance tax.
It was all going so fine... ..until you barred them.
And then they demanded their money back.
Couldn't you have borrowed it from somewhere else to pay them back?
I did.
I found a bank to lend me the money.
I was going to meet them on the boat, exchange a bankers draft for the promissory note - when the bank changed their mind.
Don't move!
Please don't move.
I phoned the Lamberts... ..and I asked them for more time.
But they refused and they said they'd be taking me to court.
So you killed them.
Well, I hadn't um...intended to initially.
I went on to the boat that evening when they were out to see if they'd left the promissory note on board.
It was only after I found it that I... thought about disconnecting the gas pipe.
'Night.
Good night.
(FAINT HISSING)
(MOBILE RINGS)
Yes?
About our agreement.
I wondered if you might
- Oh, wait a mo, can you?
I'll wait, Carolyn.
JERRY:
What's that smell?
And that meant the witness, Max Fuller, had to die.
They used a London business acquaintance of Jerry's because they didn't want any risk of it being mentioned to locals.
But his address was on the document.
I had to do it straightaway before he heard about the accident and mentioned the loan to anyone.
Yes?
I'm really sorry to bother you.
I don't know if you remember me.
My name is Claire Powell.
I'm a friend of the Lamberts.
Yes, of course.
This is a surprise.
Well, my car has been stolen.
How awful.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
Not at all.
Come on up.
It's the third floor.
(BUZZER)
(DISTANT OPERA)
You could probably do with a drink.
Argh!
Who are you?
I don't understand.
I know.
You always wanted to be in charge.
In control.
But you never really were, were you, bubs?
You never really did anything...
except talk.
You always talked well.
I like that.
I had to fix things... so we could go on pretending.
And Freddie?
Um... she said that she wouldn't mention the loan to anyone if I helped her out.
But I had to get her copy of the IOU and make sure there weren't any more.
I told her I had the identity of an imposter... and that I wanted the copy of the IOU in exchange for the name.
She thought it was a journalist but the name I was going to give her... was Sergeant Jones.
I recognised him outside the post office with Ruth.
The only copy.
May I?
(SIGHS)
Thank you.
So, the imposter's name -
I knew everyone would be at roll call but, in the event,
I was just seconds away from being seen.
Lucy was coming up the front stairs as I went down the back.
I ran home through the woods.
Paddy hadn't even woken up.
It was perfect.
So...what now, Claire?
I'd really like to let you out but... ..but if I open the doors again...
..there's not going to be enough gas for this to work.
At least let Paddy out.
No.
No.
What would I do?
Where would I go?
No, no, no.
I'll...
I'll stick with Claire.
Go out with a bang.
Actually, I don't think there's enough gas in the room to cause an explosion.
I don't think you changed the gas bottle, Paddy, did you?
No, that's where you're wrong.
He did because he told me he did.
Please.
(GASPS FOR AIR)
(SOBS)
(SOBS)
So, thank God Paddy was a lazy, good-for-nothing husband.
Everybody has their place in this world.
Come on. (CLICKS TONGUE)
Mr Barnaby, Mrs Barnaby.
Afternoon.
Getting my sister up to speed on what happened today.
George is good at keeping me up to date with confidential stuff.
Yes, thank you, Millie.
I hear you and your sergeant had a pretty close call.
I blame it all on George.
It wouldn't have come to light without his intervention.
I hope Sykes didn't disgrace himself.
He did make amorous advances towards two of my bitches which wasn't the best of starts.
But I think, from Sykes' point of view, it was top banana.
Consider him part of the pack.
Fantastic news.
Thank you.
Well, we're going for a walk.
Come on Tor, come on Fidget.
George.
Good job, by the way.
Thanks.
And I don't think I thanked you for er...putting in a word.
Oh, call it a parting gift.
I've decided I'm going to do some more fishing.
Like Tom.
He suggested a holiday in Ireland.
Guinness and trout.
Sounds good.
Tom is a hard act to follow.
You're getting there.
Come on, George.
itfc subtitles
We're beginning our initial descent into Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Thank you for flying United.
Reckon we'll be landing soon.
Phil, honey, you promised-- not till we got there.
This year, we're going to a dude ranch with the whole family.
Mm-hmm.
The family.
What if Dylan buys his own ticket?
We'll be sleeping in separate cabins.
What if Dylan and I share a horse?
Mm, I hate landing.
We'll get through this.
Wow!
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing?
I want my ears to pop.
Try putting a little Rouge on 'em.
Nobody gets me.
Wow.
Isn't this beautiful, little cowgirl?
You hate her sparkly outfit, don't you?
No, I told you, it's fine.
I just didn't like you wearing a matching one.
So we haven't told the family yet, but we've decided to adopt a baby boy.
From America this time.
You might say we're "buying domestic."
In private...
You might say that in private.
Our adoption attorney told us it would be a good idea to make a photo book to show prospective moms.
Ues, but he thought that Cam's version was a little too "artsy,"
so we've decided to take a few rugged shots at the ranch to, you know, balance it out.
I don't think it need balancing out.
Really?
It's called "Production value."
Horse.
Look, Jay!
So beautiful!
Your ears haven't popped yet, huh?
I'm like the horse whisperer.
But something is making this one skittish.
Whoa.
Look at the mountains.
They're amazing.
I've never been this far from home before now I've never been this far.
Where's a cliff when you need one?
Look, kids!
A real life cowboy!
Oh.
Come see.
Come see.
- Uh-oh.
- What's he doing?
Oh, my.
My name is Hank.
Here at the Lost Creek Ranch, you're gonna ride, you're gonna rope, and you're gonna shoot.
You're gonna see a sky so full of stars, it'll put your city lights to shame.
And when it's all done, you might just encounter a piece of yourselves you never knew was there.
Are there any questions?
Uh, do we book spa treatments through you or...
I like you, kid.
I'm gonna call you "Hollywood."
That wasn't an answer.
And who's this cactus flower?
What?
That's my wife Gloria.
Well, she's "Cactus Flower" now, old-timer.
These, uh, these nicknames-- are they set in stone?
Okey dokey.
You ready, gunslinger?
I heard word of trouble in these parts.
Pull!
That oughta fix it, eh, Jay?
You got a piece of it.
I've been practicing like crazy, all my cowboy skills-- shootin', ropin'.
pancake eating'.
Why?
Because sometimes
I feel like Jay doesn't respect me as a man.
It's just that when you say, "Phil is my son-in-law,"
it sounds like you're saying, "Phyllis, my son-in-law."
- That's ridiculous.
- Okay, who's your son-in-law?
Phyllis.
I'm not asking for a hug.
I just want to get that look of newfound respect, like...
Or...
Or... mm.
Yeah.
Check it out.
Two birds, one leg.
Pull it!
Not bad, eh, Old-timer?
Uh, see, slappy only had three fingers.
What?
He only had three fingers.
Who's next?
Oh, me.
Me.
Oh, this is good.
This is good.
Tres macho.
No smile.
Don't smile.
Good.
You ready?
Wait.
Do I say "pull"?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Mitchell, why don't you go find Manny at the spa?
Wouldn't that be more fun?
Yeah.
I realized that if I was gonna raise a boy,
I needed to butch up my life.
You know, I wanted to be able to teach my son all the things that my Dad taught Claire.
Hey, Hollywood.
I don't love that.
Wanna see something?
Oh, my gosh.
Is that a firecracker?
Shh!
Now I just need to find the perfect thing to blow up.
Is that thing even legal?
Not here.
It's from Germany.
If they had this during the war, right now we'd all be knee-deep in strudel.
Watch it!
What you doing, eh?
You reading'?
Trying to.
I'm not so good at it either.
- I'm not surprised.
- That was a joke.
I'm Jimmy Scrivano.
You want to see me do a cannonball?
I'd rather see you get hit by one, but...
Ha.
Good one, gorgeous.
Jay!
Is this like the lobster?
!
Do I get to pick one for dinner?
Because this one looks very tender.
Look alive, Old-timer.
One of your calves is getting away.
Hey, something's wrong with my horse.
She's veering left.
When this happened to my Uncle, it was a stroke.
Oh, there's nothing wrong with Buttercup.
You just gotta let her know who's boss!
Beautiful form, Cactus Flower!
Beautiful!
You look like a dadgum conquistadora!
She's deaf, but I can hear ya.
Why are you riding that way?
I'm afraid that cow over there might bite me.
Oh, yes, he's gonna come up and bite you because your leg looks so desirable with those-- are those canvas?
Okay, Phil, ease that one back over towards me.
- Got it.
- Ease him back this way.
Hey!
Piece of cake, huh, Jay?
- Huh?
- Ease that one over to Bossy.
Which one's Bossy?
- That's my nickname for your wife.
- Hilarious.
Go, Mom!
Whoo!
Yeah, Mom!
You rock!
Oh, I wish I had a rock.
Hey.
It wouldn't kill you to be nice to Dylan.
It might.
But, honey, I don't know why you always stick up for him.
Haley can do so much better.
Because I know what it's like to fall for a girl whose dad thinks I'm not good enough.
All right, you're right.
I can make more of an effort.
That's the woman I love.
We taking a little break over here?
Laying some pipe?
- No.
Sorry.
I was just talking to Bossy.
- Uh-huh.
- Phil!
- I'm sorry.
Jay, look!
I got this one!
I got this one!
She's veering left again.
When we get back, I'm gonna see if she can track a pencil with her eyes.
Okay, Lily, I'm going to push you one more time.
Now don't kick me, okay?
Aah!
Oh!
Lily!
I said don't kick me.
Okay?
You know it's your own fault that's happening.
Why don't you try standing behind her?
You are an idiot.
Oh, really?
I ain't the one getting kicked.
- Why are you following me?
- Why are you fighting me here, gorgeous?
This works.
I really, really don't appreciate you calling me "gorgeous."
I just want to enjoy time with my family, so if you don't mind-- mm!
Not a problem.
See you around, sunshine.
You kissed a boy!
No, the boy kissed me.
Okay, Lily?
The boy kissed me.
♪ I rode a horse for the first time today ♪

Okay.
Hey, Dylan.
Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.
I was wondering if we could have a little chat.
Oh.
You want me to go home.
No, no.
It's the-- the opposite of that.
I want you to go home?
No, I, um, I want you to know how glad I am that you're here.
Really?
'Cause sometimes I just get this vibe you don't like me.
Oh.
Dylan, no.
I'm sorry.
I-I like you.
I-I like you a lot.
I just...
It's complicated because Haley's my daughter.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
You are totally a hot mom, but I can't do this.
Oh, my God.
Okay, we-- there's--no, no.
I merely meant that I'm sorry if I made you feel unwelcome.
Whew!
That would have been awkward.
So awkward.
You know, but for the record, Mrs. Dunphy...
Yes?
- If Haley wasn't my girlfriend...
- Yeah.
- And Mr. Dunphy was out of the picture...
- Mm-hmm.
I would be honored to share your bed and raise Luke, Alex, and Haley as my own.
Okay.
Good talk.

- Oh, my gosh.
Oh.
It was--it was dark.
I-I couldn't see it.
Thank you.
So did you set off the firecracker yet?
When I do, you won't have to ask.
First, all the electronics will go out, then comes the heat flash.
Afterwards, the living will envy the dead.
And yet I'm the one on the "No-fly" list.
You know what?
Maybe next time I'll just catch it and then hand it to you.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, let's do that.
You--you do everything, and I'll do nothing.
Something on your mind?
This isn't the right place to talk about it.
Okay.
I-I'm s--
I'm not sure if we should have another baby.
What?
Are you serious?
I think that we might be rushing into this.
Rushing into-- we've been working--
Everybody, it's me, Dylan.
I just wanted to thank you all for bringing me on this trip and making me feel like one of the family, uh, especially Bossy.
So I can't think of a better time to ask something of the woman that I love.
Okay.
No, no.
Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy, will you do me the honors of being my lawfully wedded--
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
No proposals.
Not now.
Not gonna happen.
She's a child, so...
- Mom!
- You're still in high school!
- I meant after she graduates.
- Not then.
Not now.
Not ever.
Seriously, what are you two gonna live off of?
The--the--the royalties from the horsey song?
- Put it back in your pocket.
- Would you stop it?
- No, I won't.
I won't.
- No, it's okay.
I guess I'll just turn in.
Just so you know, there's a fan in my cabin
- that sounds like someone crying.
- Oh.
Dylan, wait!
I hate you!
Oh, come on.
Haley, get back here!
Phil, anything?
I think you said it all, Claire.
You want me to rope her?
I can, you know.
For what it's worth, my second wife was in high school.
Sweetie, here.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
- Gone.
- It's gone!
It's over there!
It's not back there.
- We counted to three.
- Yes.
Hey.
Where have you been?
I-I slept on the couch in the lodge.
I know you didn't want to have a big fight last night.
Well, I'm ready now.
Cam, I'm sorry.
Look, what if I can't do the father-son stuff?
The hunting, the--the sports, the Three Stooges?
You know what happens in real life when someone gets hit in the head with a ladder?
They go to the hospital and they get an MRI.
Never see that scene.
I think you're overthinking this.
You know, I love sports, I love the Stooges.
We've got this covered.
No.
No, you-- you got it covered, but I'm just stuck on the sidelines, pretending to understand the rules, and...
You know, my dad was a rough-and-tumble guy, and I just-- I could never relate to him.
And I don't know.
I just don't think I could handle disappointing...
two generations.
I think you're more masculine than you give yourself credit for.
Who puts a birdhouse next to a porch?
Claire, I know that you're worried that Dylan is gonna break Haley's heart, but I see in his eyes that he's gonna stick with her forever.
No matter what, he's always going to be with her.
On your deathbed--
Okay.
All right.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm gonna go find her.
No.
You push too hard, you chase her right into his arms, you'll end up with a boob for a son-in-law.
Believe me, you don't want that.
What's that supposed to mean?
- What?
- Hey, have you guys seen Dylan?
- No.
No.
Why?
- I'm not talking to you.
He said he was going out for a walk last night, and no one's seen him since.
Sweetheart, I'm sure he's fine.
Maybe after last night, he just went home.
Doubt it.
He left his luggage.
We have to do something.
If he doesn't eat five times a day, he gets spacey.
What would that even look like?
We'll find him.
Hank?
We got a situation here!
What seems to be the trouble?
We need to talk.
What?
You stole my first kiss.
What are you talkin' about?
I had it all planned out.
It was supposed to be special, someone with a high GPA and a bright future, not a Mario brother.
Fine.
You know what?
I don't even want your kiss.
Here, you can have it back.
There.
Now we're even.
Well, keep it.
I don't-
- I don't want it anymore.
What am I doing?
Okay, people.
Looks like we have a walker.
Right now he is facing treacherous terrain, sudden drops, mountain lions, hungry bears, oh, and wolverines.
That is, if the hypothermia didn't already get him.
Why did we come here again?
So our best bet is to split up.
You two are gonna take the North hiking trail.
- Can I go with my Dad instead?
- Negative.
I need Buffalo Phil and Old-timer...
To check the Snake River.
Buffalo Phil-- worth the wait.
Me and Cactus Flower will ride on up to Destiny Ridge.
Maybe I should ride up there with her.
Negatory.
That trail is for advanced riders only.
We don't need another dead body.
"Another"?
Let's go!
Move 'em out.
Phil, help me saddle my horse, will ya?
Well, look who's suddenly needed by his father-in-law.
Phyllis.
Phil... is.
Hey, Uncle Mitch.
Whatcha doing?
Oh, hey.
Just--just thinkin'.
You know, I've been meaning to tell you, you're a super fun Uncle.
And I'm saying this as a boy.
Uncle Cameron sent you over here, didn't he?
What?
That's hilarious.
No, I love how you and me can joke like this.
Okay, Luke, look, I don't know how much Cam told you, but I don't think this is a problem that you can help me with.
It's...
Okay, good.
I've got my own problem.
What?
What's that?
Can you keep a secret?
I kept a pretty big one for 22 years, so...
I've got this new firecracker, and I can't decide what to blow up.
Oh, Luke, that's dangerous.
I know.
That's what's fun about it.
I don't get boys.
What is so great about destroying things?
It turns stuff into flying chunks of stuff.
Okay, no.
No, g-give it to me.
Come on.
Fine.
I take it back.
You're not that fun.
All right, hey, look, um, we'll do it together, all right?
You just made the best decision of your life.
Okay.
Come on.
Damn it!
Buttercup!
What the hell's wrong with this horse?
Jay.
I want to talk to you about that son-in-law crack you made at breakfast.
- Oh, I didn't mean anything by that.
- I think you did.
I get that I wasn't your first choice to marry Claire, but it's been 18 years, and there hasn't been a day when I wasn't a loyal husband to your daughter and a great dad to your grandkids.
So if we've still got a problem, now it's your problem.
Phil, wait up.
Let me ask you something, man to man.
Okay.
You notice anything funny about the...
Hank character and, uh...
Gloria?
Yeah, he's hitting on her.
Why?
I knew it.
Where are you going?
Destiny Ridge.
Buttercup, ha!
Buttercup, hiya!
Seriously?
Okay.
Okay, it's clear.
- After this, we're gonna have some angry birds.
-Yeah.
It's gonna be "Bye bye Birdie."
It's a big musical from the '60s.
No.
Forget it.
What you said.
Okay.
Okay, go.
That's it?
I'm sorry, buddy.
- I brought that thing all the way from-- whoa!
- Whoa!
Cam, I did a boy thing!
I blew up the birdhouse!
You should have seen it.
It was so awesome.
That's great!
Yeah.
I think I can do this.
I mean, maybe not everything and maybe not right away, and
- not the three stooges...
- No.
I do.
I want a son.
I'm sorry I panicked.
Oh, that's great.
Now maybe we can go back to taking pictures for the book.
Yes!
Pictures of me blowing up stuff!
Okay, I see we've overcorrected.
I know you think I'm the mean mom who wouldn't let you marry your boyfriend, but someday you're gonna realize,
I-I did what had to be done.
No, you didn't.
I was never gonna marry Dylan.
I told him no.
Oh, you did?
Thank God.
But it was my proposal to turn down.
You know, you keep telling me to act like an adult, but then you don't even give me a chance.
Oh.
You sort of got me there.
But, sweetheart, I don't expect you to understand this.
I certainly didn't when I was your age.
I look at you as my baby, and I always will.
It's--it's just what moms do.
I'm not a baby anymore!
Okay?
And I am never gonna see Dylan again!
Dylan!
Dylan!
What?
!
Where are you?
!
Wyoming!
You're okay!
I had the craziest night.
When you rejected me, I felt lost and scared.
And then I went out on a walk, and I felt a whole different kind of lost and scared.
And then I fell asleep in the stable.
And when I woke up, I met this woman named Jake who's strong like a man.
Then we had this long talk, and he/she hired me.
Uh, what-- what do you mean, she hired you?
I work here now.
S-so you're staying?
Yeah.
What about us?
It could never work.
We're from two different worlds.
You're a high school student, and I'm a ranch hand.
I'm just--I'm so glad you're okay.
I really am.
I am.
Thanks.
But we're not supposed to fraternize with the guests.
Right.
Dylan!
Dylan!
You got a voice like a meadowlark, don't ya?
Dylan!
Yeah, I sure am worried about that kid.
Dylan!
He ain't down there.
Oh, come on now.
You come up here for the cowboy experience.
You're looking at him.
Do I look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband?
Yes.
Really?
Hey!
I think you better move away from that woman.
Only we touch our women when they don't want us to.
Easy.
Easy there, friend-o.
I wasn't hitting on this filly.
This is all part of the package.
If I didn't play the bad guy, he wouldn't get to ride up and be the big hero.
He doesn't need you to make him a hero.
He's a hero every day.
Why don't you do us all a favor?
Get back on your horse, ride down to the lodge and tell 'em--
- Can you keep him still?
I'm trying to make a point.
- I am.
Okay.
Okay, I'm gone.
Ma'am.
Wait.
Wait.
There's something I wanna say to you.
I will only be checking "somewhat satisfied"
on our comment card.
Jeez.
I mean, he was great with the kids.
I looked it up.
The distance between our houses is 2,443 miles.
Yeah, but, you know, on some maps, it's like--pfft!
This big.
God, you're stupid.
All in all, it was a great vacation.
We may have lost a man...
But out there on the range, under that great big sky, we found a part of ourselves we never knew was there, just like the horny cowboy said we would.
No.
Fine.
We're beginning our initial descent into Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Thank you for flying United.
Reckon we'll be landing soon.
Phil, honey, you promised-- not till we got there.
This year, we're going to a dude ranch with the whole family.
Mm-hmm.
The family.
What if Dylan buys his own ticket?
We'll be sleeping in separate cabins.
What if Dylan and I share a horse?
Mm, I hate landing.
We'll get through this.
Wow!
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing?
I want my ears to pop.
Try putting a little Rouge on 'em.
Nobody gets me.
Wow.
Isn't this beautiful, little cowgirl?
You hate her sparkly outfit, don't you?
No, I told you, it's fine.
I just didn't like you wearing a matching one.
So we haven't told the family yet, but we've decided to adopt a baby boy.
From America this time.
You might say we're "buying domestic."
In private...
You might say that in private.
Our adoption attorney told us it would be a good idea to make a photo book to show prospective moms.
Ues, but he thought that Cam's version was a little too "artsy,"
so we've decided to take a few rugged shots at the ranch to, you know, balance it out.
I don't think it need balancing out.
Really?
It's called "Production value."
Horse.
Look, Jay!
So beautiful!
Your ears haven't popped yet, huh?
I'm like the horse whisperer.
But something is making this one skittish.
Whoa.
Look at the mountains.
They're amazing.
I've never been this far from home before now I've never been this far.
Where's a cliff when you need one?
Look, kids!
A real life cowboy!
Oh.
Come see.
Come see.
- Uh-oh.
- What's he doing?
Oh, my.
My name is Hank.
Here at the Lost Creek Ranch, you're gonna ride, you're gonna rope, and you're gonna shoot.
You're gonna see a sky so full of stars, it'll put your city lights to shame.
And when it's all done, you might just encounter a piece of yourselves you never knew was there.
Are there any questions?
Uh, do we book spa treatments through you or...
I like you, kid.
I'm gonna call you "Hollywood."
That wasn't an answer.
And who's this cactus flower?
What?
That's my wife Gloria.
Well, she's "Cactus Flower" now, old-timer.
These, uh, these nicknames-- are they set in stone?
Okey dokey.
You ready, gunslinger?
I heard word of trouble in these parts.
Pull!
That oughta fix it, eh, Jay?
You got a piece of it.
I've been practicing like crazy, all my cowboy skills-- shootin', ropin'.
pancake eating'.
Why?
Because sometimes
I feel like Jay doesn't respect me as a man.
It's just that when you say, "Phil is my son-in-law,"
it sounds like you're saying, "Phyllis, my son-in-law."
- That's ridiculous.
- Okay, who's your son-in-law?
Phyllis.
I'm not asking for a hug.
I just want to get that look of newfound respect, like...
Or...
Or... mm.
Yeah.
Check it out.
Two birds, one leg.
Pull it!
Not bad, eh, Old-timer?
Uh, see, slappy only had three fingers.
What?
He only had three fingers.
Who's next?
Oh, me.
Me.
Oh, this is good.
This is good.
Tres macho.
No smile.
Don't smile.
Good.
You ready?
Wait.
Do I say "pull"?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Mitchell, why don't you go find Manny at the spa?
Wouldn't that be more fun?
Yeah.
I realized that if I was gonna raise a boy,
I needed to butch up my life.
You know, I wanted to be able to teach my son all the things that my Dad taught Claire.
Hey, Hollywood.
I don't love that.
Wanna see something?
Oh, my gosh.
Is that a firecracker?
Shh!
Now I just need to find the perfect thing to blow up.
Is that thing even legal?
Not here.
It's from Germany.
If they had this during the war, right now we'd all be knee-deep in strudel.
Watch it!

You know, I love sports, I love the Stooges.
We've got this covered.
No.
No, you-- you got it covered, but I'm just stuck on the sidelines, pretending to understand the rules, and...
You know, my dad was a rough-and-tumble guy, and I just-- I could never relate to him.
And I don't know.
I just don't think I could handle disappointing...
two generations.
I think you're more masculine than you give yourself credit for.
Who puts a birdhouse next to a porch?
Claire, I know that you're worried that Dylan is gonna break Haley's heart, but I see in his eyes that he's gonna stick with her forever.
No matter what, he's always going to be with her.
On your deathbed--
Okay.
All right.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm gonna go find her.
No.
You push too hard, you chase her right into his arms, you'll end up with a boob for a son-in-law.
Believe me, you don't want that.
What's that supposed to mean?
- What?
- Hey, have you guys seen Dylan?
- No.
No.
Why?
- I'm not talking to you.
He said he was going out for a walk last night, and no one's seen him since.
Sweetheart, I'm sure he's fine.
Maybe after last night, he just went home.
Doubt it.
He left his luggage.
We have to do something.
If he doesn't eat five times a day, he gets spacey.
What would that even look like?
We'll find him.
Hank?
We got a situation here!
What seems to be the trouble?
We need to talk.
What?
You stole my first kiss.
What are you talkin' about?
I had it all planned out.
It was supposed to be special, someone with a high GPA and a bright future, not a Mario brother.
Fine.
You know what?
I don't even want your kiss.
Here, you can have it back.
There.
Now we're even.
Well, keep it.
I don't-
- I don't want it anymore.
What am I doing?
Okay, people.
Looks like we have a walker.
Right now he is facing treacherous terrain, sudden drops, mountain lions, hungry bears, oh, and wolverines.
That is, if the hypothermia didn't already get him.
Why did we come here again?
So our best bet is to split up.
You two are gonna take the North hiking trail.
- Can I go with my Dad instead?
- Negative.
I need Buffalo Phil and Old-timer...
To check the Snake River.
Buffalo Phil-- worth the wait.
Me and Cactus Flower will ride on up to Destiny Ridge.
Maybe I should ride up there with her.
Negatory.
That trail is for advanced riders only.
We don't need another dead body.
"Another"?
Let's go!
Move 'em out.
Phil, help me saddle my horse, will ya?
Well, look who's suddenly needed by his father-in-law.
Phyllis.
Phil... is.
Hey, Uncle Mitch.
Whatcha doing?
Oh, hey.
Just--just thinkin'.
You know, I've been meaning to tell you, you're a super fun Uncle.
And I'm saying this as a boy.
Uncle Cameron sent you over here, didn't he?
What?
That's hilarious.
No, I love how you and me can joke like this.
Okay, Luke, look, I don't know how much Cam told you, but I don't think this is a problem that you can help me with.
It's...
Okay, good.
I've got my own problem.
What?
What's that?
Can you keep a secret?
I kept a pretty big one for 22 years, so...
I've got this new firecracker, and I can't decide what to blow up.
Oh, Luke, that's dangerous.
I know.
That's what's fun about it.
I don't get boys.
What is so great about destroying things?
It turns stuff into flying chunks of stuff.
Okay, no.
No, g-give it to me.
Come on.
Fine.
I take it back.
You're not that fun.
All right, hey, look, um, we'll do it together, all right?
You just made the best decision of your life.
Okay.
Come on.
Damn it!
Buttercup!
What the hell's wrong with this horse?
Jay.
I want to talk to you about that son-in-law crack you made at breakfast.
- Oh, I didn't mean anything by that.
- I think you did.
I get that I wasn't your first choice to marry Claire, but it's been 18 years, and there hasn't been a day when I wasn't a loyal husband to your daughter and a great dad to your grandkids.
So if we've still got a problem, now it's your problem.
Phil, wait up.
Let me ask you something, man to man.
Okay.
You notice anything funny about the...
Hank character and, uh...
Gloria?
Yeah, he's hitting on her.
Why?
I knew it.
Where are you going?
Destiny Ridge.
Buttercup, ha!
Buttercup, hiya!
Seriously?
Okay.
Okay, it's clear.
- After this, we're gonna have some angry birds.
-Yeah.
It's gonna be "Bye bye Birdie."
It's a big musical from the '60s.
No.
Forget it.
What you said.
Okay.
Okay, go.
That's it?
I'm sorry, buddy.
- I brought that thing all the way from-- whoa!
- Whoa!
Cam, I did a boy thing!
I blew up the birdhouse!
You should have seen it.
It was so awesome.
That's great!
Yeah.
I think I can do this.
I mean, maybe not everything and maybe not right away, and
- not the three stooges...
- No.
I do.
I want a son.
I'm sorry I panicked.
Oh, that's great.
Now maybe we can go back to taking pictures for the book.
Yes!
Pictures of me blowing up stuff!
Okay, I see we've overcorrected.
I know you think I'm the mean mom who wouldn't let you marry your boyfriend, but someday you're gonna realize,
I-I did what had to be done.
No, you didn't.
I was never gonna marry Dylan.
I told him no.
Oh, you did?
Thank God.
But it was my proposal to turn down.
You know, you keep telling me to act like an adult, but then you don't even give me a chance.
Oh.
You sort of got me there.
But, sweetheart, I don't expect you to understand this.
I certainly didn't when I was your age.
I look at you as my baby, and I always will.
It's--it's just what moms do.
I'm not a baby anymore!
Okay?
And I am never gonna see Dylan again!
Dylan!
Dylan!
What?
!
Where are you?
!
Wyoming!
You're okay!
I had the craziest night.
When you rejected me, I felt lost and scared.
And then I went out on a walk, and I felt a whole different kind of lost and scared.
And then I fell asleep in the stable.
And when I woke up, I met this woman named Jake who's strong like a man.
Then we had this long talk, and he/she hired me.
Uh, what-- what do you mean, she hired you?
I work here now.
S-so you're staying?
Yeah.
What about us?
It could never work.
We're from two different worlds.
You're a high school student, and I'm a ranch hand.
I'm just--I'm so glad you're okay.
I really am.
I am.
Thanks.
But we're not supposed to fraternize with the guests.
Right.
Dylan!
Dylan!
You got a voice like a meadowlark, don't ya?
Dylan!
Yeah, I sure am worried about that kid.
Dylan!
He ain't down there.
Oh, come on now.
You come up here for the cowboy experience.
You're looking at him.
Do I look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband?
Yes.
Really?
Hey!
I think you better move away from that woman.
Only we touch our women when they don't want us to.
Easy.
Easy there, friend-o.
I wasn't hitting on this filly.
This is all part of the package.
If I didn't play the bad guy, he wouldn't get to ride up and be the big hero.
He doesn't need you to make him a hero.
He's a hero every day.
Why don't you do us all a favor?
Get back on your horse, ride down to the lodge and tell 'em--
- Can you keep him still?
I'm trying to make a point.
- I am.
Okay.
Okay, I'm gone.
Ma'am.
Wait.
Wait.
There's something I wanna say to you.
I will only be checking "somewhat satisfied"
on our comment card.
Jeez.
I mean, he was great with the kids.
I looked it up.
The distance between our houses is 2,443 miles.
Yeah, but, you know, on some maps, it's like--pfft!
This big.
God, you're stupid.
All in all, it was a great vacation.
We may have lost a man...
But out there on the range, under that great big sky, we found a part of ourselves we never knew was there, just like the horny cowboy said we would.
No.
Fine.
We're beginning our initial descent into Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Thank you for ?
ying United.
Reckon we'll be landing' soon.
Phil, honey, you promised.
Not till we got there.
Okay.
This year, we're goin' to a dude ranch with the whole family.
Mm-hmm.
The family.
What if Dylan buys his own ticket?
We'll be sleeping in separate cabins.
What if Dylan and I share a horse?
Mmm.
I hate landing.
We'll get through this.
Wow. it's so pretty here.
What are you doin'?
I want my ears to pop.
Try putting a little rouge on 'em.
Nobody gets me.
Wow!
isn't this beautiful, little cowgirl?
You hate her sparkly outfit, don't you?
No, I told you, it's fine.
I just didn't like you wearing a matching one.
So we haven't told the family yet, but we've decided to adopt a baby boy.
From America this time.
You might say we're buying domestic.
In private.
You might say that in private.
Our adoption attorney told us it would be a good idea ... to make a photo book to show prospective moms.
Yes.
But he thought that Cam's version was a little too "artsy,"
so we've decided to take a few rugged shots at the ranch to, you know, balance it out.
I don't think it needs balancing out.
Really?
It's called production value.
# Hey, hey #
# Hey #
Look.
A horse!
Look, Jay!
So beautiful!
Your ears haven't popped yet, huh?
I'm like the Horse Whisperer!
But something is making this one skittish!
Whoa.
Look at the mountains.
They're amazing.
I've never been this far from home before.
Now I've never been this far.
Now I've never been this far.
Where's a cliff when you need one?
Look, kids!
A real-life cowboy!
Come over.
Come see, come see.
Uh-oh.
What's he doing?
Oh, my.
Ooh!
Yeah!
My name is Hank.
Here at the Lost Creek Ranch, you're gonna ride and you're gonna rope and you're gonna shoot.
You're gonna see a sky so full of stars, it'll put your city lights to shame.
And when it's all done, you might just encounter ... a piece of yourselves you never knew was there.
Are there any questions?
Do we book spa treatments through you or-
I like you, kid.
I'm gonna call you Hollywood.
Th-That wasn't an answer.
And who's this cactus ?
ower?
What?
That's my wife, Gloria.
Well, she's Cactus Flower now, Old-timer.
These nicknames- Are they set in stone?
Okeydokey.
You ready, gunslinger?
Heard word of trouble in these parts.
Pull!
- That oughta fix it, eh, Jay?
- You got a piece of it.
I've been practicing like crazy- all my cowboy skills.
Shootin', ropin', pancake eating'.
Why?
Because sometimes, I feel like Jay doesn't respect me as a man.
It's just that when you say "Phil is my son-in-law,"
it sounds like you're saying, "Phyllis," comma, "my son-in-law."
That's ridiculous.
Okay, who's your son-in-law?
Phil is.
I'm not asking for a hug.
I just want to get that look of new found respect.
Like- Oh!
Or-
Or
- Mmm.
Yeah.
Check it out.
Two birds, one leg.
Pull it!
- Not bad, eh, Old-timer?
- Huh?
See, Slappy only had three fingers.
- What?
- He only had three fingers!
- Who's next?
- Oh, me, me.
Oh, this is good.
This is good.
Trés macho.
No smile.
Don't smile.
Good.
You ready?
Wait, do I say "Pull"?
Sorry, sorry.
Whoa!
Mitchell, why don't you go find Manny at the spa?
Wouldn't that be more fun?
Yeah.
I realized that if I was gonna raise a boy, I needed to butch up my life.
You know, I wanted to be able to teach my son all the things that my dad taught Claire.
Hey, Hollywood.
I don't love that.
You wanna see something?
Oh, my gosh!
Is that a firecracker?
Shh!
Now I just need to find the perfect thing to blow up.
- Is that thing even legal?
- Not here.
It's from Germany.
If they had this during the war, right now we'd all be knee-deep in strudel.
- Watch it!
- What ya doin', eh?
You reading'?
Trying to.
- I'm not so good at it either.
- I'm not surprised.
That was a joke.
I'm Jimmy Scrivano.
You want to see me do a cannonball?
I'd rather see you get hit by one.
Hah!
Good one, gorgeous.
Hyah!
Jay!
Is this like the lobster?
Do I get to pick one for dinner?
Because this one looks very tender!
Look alive, Old-timer!
One of your calves is gettin' away.
Somethin' wrong with my horse.
She's veering left.
When this happened to my uncle, it was a stroke.
Oh, there's nothin' wrong with Buttercup.
You just gotta let her know who's boss.
Beautiful form, Cactus Flower!
Beautiful!
You look like a dadgum conquistadora.
She's deaf, but I can hear ya.
Why are you riding that way?
I was afraid that cow over there might bite me.
Oh, yes, he's gonna come up and bite you because your leg looks so desirable with those-
Are those canvas?
Okay, Phil, ease that one back over towards me.
Got it.
Ease him back this way.
Hup-hup!
Hey!
- Piece of cake, huh,Jay?
- Huh?
- Ease that one over to Bossy.
- Which one's Bossy?
That's my nickname for your wife.
Hilarious.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Go, Mom!
Whoo!
Yo, Mom!
You rock!
Oh, I wish I had a rock.
Hey.
It wouldn't kill you to be nice to Dylan.
It might.
What
- Honey, I don't know why you always stick up for him.
Haley can do so much better.
Because I know what it's like to fall for a girl whose dad thinks I'm not good enough.
All right.
You're right.
I can make more of an effort.
That's the woman I love.
We take a little break over here?
Layin' some pipe?
No, sorry.
I was just talkin' to Bossy.
Uh-huh.
Phil!
I'm sorry.
Jay, look!
I got this one!
I got this one!
She's veering left again.
When we get back, I'm gonna see if she can track a pencil with her eyes.
Okay, Lily, I'm going to push you one more time.
Now don't kick me, okay?
Lily!
I said don't kick me, okay?
You know, it's your own fault that's happening.
- Why don't you try standing behind her?
- You are an idiot.
Oh, really?
I ain't the one getting kicked.
Why are you following me?
Why are you fighting me here, gorgeous?
This works.
I really, really don't appreciate you calling me "gorgeous."
I just want to enjoy time with my family, so if you don't mind-
Mmm-
Not a problem.
See you around, sunshine.
You kissed a boy!
No, the boy kissed me, okay, Lily?
Boy kissed me.
# I rode a horse for the first time today #
# I wasn't surprised when it went "Neigh" #
- Hey, Dylan.
- Hey.
Ms. Dunphy.
I was wondering if we could have a little chat.
Uh
- You want me to go home.
No.
No, it's the- the opposite of that.
- I want you to go home?
- Mmm.
Mm-mmm.
No, I, um
- I want you to know how glad I am that you're here.
Really?
'Cause sometimes I just get this vibe you don't like me.
No.
Dylan, no.
I'm sorry.
L
- I like you.
I
- I like you a lot.
I just- it's complicated, because ...
Haley's my daughter.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
You are totally a hot mom, but I can't do this.
Oh, my God!
Okay.
There's
- No, no.
I merely meant that I'm sorry if I made you feel unwelcome.
- Phew!
That would've been awkward.
- So awkward!
You know, but for the record, Ms. Dunphy-
Yes?
If Haley wasn't my girlfriend, and Mr. Dunphy was out of the picture,
I would be honored to share your bed ... and raise Luke, Alex and Haley as my own.
Okay.
Good talk.
# She'll be runnin' down the mountain #
# She'll be runnin' down the mountain #
# She'll be runnin' down the mountain when she come g;
The song ended two minutes ago!
Well, I tell you what.
She could play Evita.
Really?
You notice the crickets left?
Anyone want more water?
Oh, Dad, I'll take one.
Heads up.
Oh, my gosh.
It was
- It was dark.
I couldn't see it.
Thank you.
So, did you set off the firecracker yet?
When I do, you won't have to ask.
First, all the electronics will go out.
Then comes the heat flash.
Afterwards, the living will envy the dead.
And yet I'm the one on the no-fly list.
Know what?
Maybe next time I'll just catch it and then hand it to you.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, let's do that.
You do everything, and I'll do nothing.
Something on your mind?
This isn't the right place to talk about it.
Okay.
L
- I'm just-
I'm not sure if we should have another baby.
What?
Are you serious?
I think that we might be rushing into this.
Rushing into it?
We've been working on-
Everybody.
It's me, Dylan.
I just wanted to thank you all for bringing me on this trip ... and making me feel like one of the family.
- Especially Bossy.
- Aww.
So, I can't think of a better time ... to ask something of the woman that I love.
Okay.
No, no.
Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy, will you do me the honors of being my lawfully wedded-
No.
No, no, no, no!
No proposals!
Not now.
Not gonna happen.
- She's a child, so-
- Mom!
- You're still in high school!
- I meant after she graduates.
Not then, not now, not ever.
Seriously, what are you two gonna live off of?
The royalties from the horsey song?
Put it back in your pocket.
Would you stop it!
No, I won't.
I won't.
No, it's okay.
I guess I'll just turn in.
Just so you know, there's a fan in my cabin that sounds like someone crying.
Oh, God.
Dylan, wait!
I hate you!
Oh, come on!
Haley, get back here.
Phil?
Anything?
I think you said it all, Claire.
You want me to rope her?
I can, you know.
For what it's worth, my second wife was in high school.
Let's do it again.
One, two, three.
Two, three.
Gone.
it's gone!
It's over there!
it's not back there.
We counted to three!
Yes.
- Hey.
- Where have you been?
I slept on the couch in the lodge.
- I know you didn't want to have a big fight last night.
- Well, I'm ready now.
Cam, I'm sorry.
Look, what if I can't do the father-son stuff?
The hunting, the- the sports, The Three Stooges.
You know what happens in real life when someone gets hit in the head with a ladder?
They go to the hospital and they get an M.R.I. Never see that scene.
I think you're overthinking this.
You know, I love sports.
I love the Stooges.
We've got this covered.
No.
No, you- you've got it covered.
I'm just stuck on the sidelines, pretending to understand the rules and-
You know, my dad was a rough and tumble guy, and I just
- I could never relate to him.
I don't know.
I just don't think I could handle disappointing two generations.
I think you're more masculine than you give yourself credit for.
Oh, God!
Who puts a birdhouse next to a porch?
Claire, I know that you're worried that Dylan is gonna break Haley's heart, but I see in his eyes that he's gonna stick with her forever.
No matter what, he's always going to be with her.
- On your deathbed.
- Okay.
All right.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm gonna go find her.
No.
You push too hard, you chase her right into his arms.
You'll end up with a boob for a son-in-law.
Believe me, you don't want that.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What?
Hey, have you guys seen Dylan?
No.
No, why?
I'm not talking to you.
He said he was going out for a walk last night, and no one's seen him since.
Sweetheart, I'm sure he's fine.
Maybe after last night, he just went home.
Doubt it.
He left his luggage.
We have to do something.
If he doesn't eat five times a day, he gets spacey.
What would that even look like?
We'll find him.
Hank?
We got a situation here!
What seems to be the trouble?
We need to talk.
What?
You stole my first kiss!
What are you talkin' about?
I had it all planned out.
it was supposed to be special.
Someone with a high G.P.A. and a bright future, not a Mario Brother.
Fine!
You know what?
I don't even want your kiss.
Here, you can have it back.
There.
Now we're even.
Keep it!
I don't
- I don't want it anymore.
What am I doing?
Okay, people.
Looks like we have a walker.
Right now he is facing treacherous terrain, sudden drops, mountain lions, hungry bears- oh, and wolverines.
That is, if the hypothermia didn't already get him.
Why did we come here again?
So, our best bet is to split up.
You two are gonna take to the north hiking trail.
Can I go with my dad instead?
Negative.
I need Buffalo Phil and Old-timer to check the Snake River.
Buffalo Phil.
Worth the wait.
Me and Cactus Flower will ride on up to Destiny Ridge.
Maybe I should ride up there with her.

Phyllis.
Phil ... is.
Hey, Uncle Mitch.
What ya doin'?
Oh, hey.
Just
- Just thinkin'.
You know, I've been meaning to tell you, you're a super-fun uncle.
And I'm saying this as a boy.
Uncle Cameron sent you over here, didn't he?
What?
That's hilarious!
No, I love how you and me can joke like this.
Okay.
Luke, look.
I don't know how much Cam told you, but I don't think this is a problem that you can help me with.
Okay, good.
Got my own problem.
Wh
- What's that?
Can you keep a secret?
I kept a pretty big one for 22 years, so-
I've got this new firecracker, and I can't decide what to blow up.
Oh, Luke, that's dangerous.
I know!
That's what's fun about it.
I don't get boys.
What is so great about destroying things?
It turns stuff into flying chunks of stuff.
Okay.
No.
No.
Give it to me.
Fine.
I take it back.
You're not that fun.
All right.
Hey, look, um-
We'll do it together, all right?
You just made the best decision of your life.
Okay.
Damn it, Buttercup!
What the hell's wrong with this horse?
Jay.
Wow.
I want to talk to you about that son-in-law crack you made at breakfast.
Oh, I didn't mean anything by that!

Go!
Cool!

- I'm sorry, buddy.
I brought that thing all the way from-
Whoa!
Whoa!
Cam!
I did a boy thing!
I blew up the birdhouse!
You should've seen it.
It was so awesome!
That's great!
Yeah.
I think I can do this.
I mean, maybe not everything, and maybe not right away, and not The Three Stooges.
No.

So you're staying?
Yeah.
What about us?
It could never work.
We're from two different worlds.
You're a high school student, and I'm a ranch hand.
I'm just- I'm so glad you're okay.
I really am.
I am.
Thanks.
But we're not supposed to fraternize with the guests.
Right.
Dylan!
Dylan!
You got a voice like a meadowlark, don't ya?
Dylan!
I sure am worried about that kid.
Dylan-
He ain't down there.
Oh, come on now.
You come up here for the cowboy experience.
You're lookin' at him.
Do I look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband?
- Yes.
- Really?
Hey!
Think you better move away from that woman.
Only we touch our women when they don't want us to.
Easy.
Easy there, friend-o.
I wasn't hitting' on this filly.
This is all part of the package.
If I didn't play the bad guy, he wouldn't get to ride up and be the big hero.
He doesn't need you to make him a hero.
He's a hero every day!
Why don't you do us all a favor?
Get back on your horse, ride down to the lodge and tell 'em-
Can you keep him still?
I'm trying to make a point.
I am.
Okay, okay, I'm gone.
Ma'am.
Wait.
Wait!
There's something I want to say to you.
I will only be checking "somewhat satisfied" on our comment card.
Oh, geez.
I mean, he was great with the kids.
I looked it up.
The distance between our houses is 2,443 miles.
Yeah, but on some maps it's, like, this big.
God, you're stupid.
All in all, it was a great vacation.
We may have lost a man,
but out there on the range, under that great big sky, we found a part of ourselves we never knew was there.
Just like the horny cowboy said we would.
No.
Oh, fine.

We're beginning our initial descent into Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Thank you for flying United.
Reckon we'll be landing soon.
Phil, honey, you promised-- not till we got there.
This year, we're going to a dude ranch with the whole family.
Mm-hmm.
The family.
What if Dylan buys his own ticket?
We'll be sleeping in separate cabins.
What if Dylan and I share a horse?
Mm, I hate landing.
We'll get through this.
Wow!
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing?
I want my ears to pop.
Try putting a little Rouge on 'em.
Nobody gets me.
Wow.
Isn't this beautiful, little cowgirl?
You hate her sparkly outfit, don't you?
No, I told you, it's fine.
I just didn't like you wearing a matching one.
So we haven't told the family yet, but we've decided to adopt a baby boy.
From America this time.
You might say we're "buying domestic."
In private...
You might say that in private.
Our adoption attorney told us it would be a good idea to make a photo book to show prospective moms.
Ues, but he thought that Cam's version was a little too "artsy,"
so we've decided to take a few rugged shots at the ranch to, you know, balance it out.
I don't think it need balancing out.
Really?
It's called "Production value."
Horse.
Look, Jay!
So beautiful!
Your ears haven't popped yet, huh?
I'm like the horse whisperer.
But something is making this one skittish.
Whoa.
Look at the mountains.
They're amazing.
I've never been this far from home before now I've never been this far.
Where's a cliff when you need one?
Look, kids!
A real life cowboy!
Oh.
Come see.
Come see.
- Uh-oh.
- What's he doing?
Oh, my.
My name is Hank.
Here at the Lost Creek Ranch, you're gonna ride, you're gonna rope, and you're gonna shoot.
You're gonna see a sky so full of stars, it'll put your city lights to shame.
And when it's all done, you might just encounter a piece of yourselves you never knew was there.
Are there any questions?
Uh, do we book spa treatments through you or...
I like you, kid.
I'm gonna call you "Hollywood."
That wasn't an answer.
And who's this cactus flower?
What?
That's my wife Gloria.
Well, she's "Cactus Flower" now, old-timer.
These, uh, these nicknames-- are they set in stone?
Okey dokey.
You ready, gunslinger?
I heard word of trouble in these parts.
Pull!
That oughta fix it, eh, Jay?
You got a piece of it.
I've been practicing like crazy, all my cowboy skills-- shootin', ropin'.
pancake eating'.
Why?
Because sometimes
I feel like Jay doesn't respect me as a man.
It's just that when you say, "Phil is my son-in-law,"
it sounds like you're saying, "Phyllis, my son-in-law."
- That's ridiculous.
- Okay, who's your son-in-law?
Phyllis.
I'm not asking for a hug.
I just want to get that look of newfound respect, like...
Or...
Or... mm.
Yeah.
Check it out.
Two birds, one leg.
Pull it!
Not bad, eh, Old-timer?
Uh, see, slappy only had three fingers.
What?
He only had three fingers.
Who's next?
Oh, me.
Me.
Oh, this is good.
This is good.
Tres macho.
No smile.
Don't smile.
Good.
You ready?
Wait.
Do I say "pull"?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Mitchell, why don't you go find Manny at the spa?
Wouldn't that be more fun?
Yeah.
I realized that if I was gonna raise a boy,
I needed to butch up my life.
You know, I wanted to be able to teach my son all the things that my Dad taught Claire.
Hey, Hollywood.
I don't love that.
Wanna see something?
Oh, my gosh.
Is that a firecracker?
Shh!
Now I just need to find the perfect thing to blow up.
Is that thing even legal?
Not here.
It's from Germany.
If they had this during the war, right now we'd all be knee-deep in strudel.
Watch it!
What you doing, eh?
You reading'?
Trying to.
I'm not so good at it either.
- I'm not surprised.
- That was a joke.
I'm Jimmy Scrivano.
You want to see me do a cannonball?
I'd rather see you get hit by one, but...
Ha.
Good one, gorgeous.
Jay!
Is this like the lobster?
!
Do I get to pick one for dinner?
Because this one looks very tender.
Look alive, Old-timer.
One of your calves is getting away.
Hey, something's wrong with my horse.
She's veering left.
When this happened to my Uncle, it was a stroke.
Oh, there's nothing wrong with Buttercup.
You just gotta let her know who's boss!
Beautiful form, Cactus Flower!
Beautiful!
You look like a dadgum conquistadora!
She's deaf, but I can hear ya.
Why are you riding that way?
I'm afraid that cow over there might bite me.
Oh, yes, he's gonna come up and bite you because your leg looks so desirable with those-- are those canvas?
Okay, Phil, ease that one back over towards me.
- Got it.
- Ease him back this way.
Hey!
Piece of cake, huh, Jay?
- Huh?
- Ease that one over to Bossy.
Which one's Bossy?
- That's my nickname for your wife.
- Hilarious.
Go, Mom!
Whoo!
Yeah, Mom!
You rock!
Oh, I wish I had a rock.
Hey.
It wouldn't kill you to be nice to Dylan.
It might.
But, honey, I don't know why you always stick up for him.
Haley can do so much better.
Because I know what it's like to fall for a girl whose dad thinks I'm not good enough.
All right, you're right.
I can make more of an effort.
That's the woman I love.
We taking a little break over here?
Laying some pipe?
- No.
Sorry.
I was just talking to Bossy.
- Uh-huh.
- Phil!
- I'm sorry.
Jay, look!
I got this one!
I got this one!
She's veering left again.
When we get back, I'm gonna see if she can track a pencil with her eyes.
Okay, Lily, I'm going to push you one more time.
Now don't kick me, okay?
Aah!
Oh!
Lily!
I said don't kick me.
Okay?
You know it's your own fault that's happening.
Why don't you try standing behind her?
You are an idiot.
Oh, really?
I ain't the one getting kicked.
- Why are you following me?
- Why are you fighting me here, gorgeous?
This works.
I really, really don't appreciate you calling me "gorgeous."
I just want to enjoy time with my family, so if you don't mind-- mm!
Not a problem.
See you around, sunshine.
You kissed a boy!
No, the boy kissed me.
Okay, Lily?
The boy kissed me.
♪ I rode a horse for the first time today ♪
♪ wasn't surprised when it went... neigh ♪
Okay.
Hey, Dylan.
Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.
I was wondering if we could have a little chat.
Oh.
You want me to go home.
No, no.
It's the-- the opposite of that.
I want you to go home?
No, I, um, I want you to know how glad I am that you're here.
Really?
'Cause sometimes I just get this vibe you don't like me.
Oh.
Dylan, no.
I'm sorry.
I-I like you.
I-I like you a lot.
I just...
It's complicated because Haley's my daughter.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
You are totally a hot mom, but I can't do this.
Oh, my God.
Okay, we-- there's--no, no.
I merely meant that I'm sorry if I made you feel unwelcome.
Whew!
That would have been awkward.
So awkward.
You know, but for the record, Mrs. Dunphy...
Yes?
- If Haley wasn't my girlfriend...
- Yeah.
- And Mr. Dunphy was out of the picture...
- Mm-hmm.
I would be honored to share your bed and raise Luke, Alex, and Haley as my own.
Okay.
Good talk.
♪ She'll be running down the mountain ♪
♪ she'll be running down the Mountain when she come.s ♪ the song ended two minutes ago.
Well, I'll tell you what.
She could play Evita.
Really?
You notice the crickets left?
Anyone want more water?
Oh, Dad, I'll take one.
Heads up.
- Oh!
- Oh, my gosh.
Oh.
It was--it was dark.
I-I couldn't see it.
Thank you.
So did you set off the firecracker yet?
When I do, you won't have to ask.
First, all the electronics will go out, then comes the heat flash.
Afterwards, the living will envy the dead.
And yet I'm the one on the "No-fly" list.
You know what?
Maybe next time I'll just catch it and then hand it to you.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, let's do that.
You--you do everything, and I'll do nothing.
Something on your mind?
This isn't the right place to talk about it.
Okay.
I-I'm s--
I'm not sure if we should have another baby.
What?
Are you serious?
I think that we might be rushing into this.
Rushing into-- we've been working--
Everybody, it's me, Dylan.
I just wanted to thank you all for bringing me on this trip and making me feel like one of the family, uh, especially Bossy.
So I can't think of a better time to ask something of the woman that I love.
Okay.
No, no.
Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy, will you do me the honors of being my lawfully wedded--
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
No proposals.
Not now.
Not gonna happen.
She's a child, so...
- Mom!
- You're still in high school!
- I meant after she graduates.
- Not then.
Not now.
Not ever.
Seriously, what are you two gonna live off of?
The--the--the royalties from the horsey song?
- Put it back in your pocket.
- Would you stop it?
- No, I won't.
I won't.
- No, it's okay.
I guess I'll just turn in.
Just so you know, there's a fan in my cabin
- that sounds like someone crying.
- Oh.
Dylan, wait!
I hate you!
Oh, come on.
Haley, get back here!
Phil, anything?
I think you said it all, Claire.
You want me to rope her?
I can, you know.
For what it's worth, my second wife was in high school.
Sweetie, here.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
- Gone.
- It's gone!
It's over there!
It's not back there.
- We counted to three.
- Yes.
Hey.
Where have you been?
I-I slept on the couch in the lodge.
I know you didn't want to have a big fight last night.
Well, I'm ready now.
Cam, I'm sorry.
Look, what if I can't do the father-son stuff?
The hunting, the--the sports, the Three Stooges?
You know what happens in real life when someone gets hit in the head with a ladder?
They go to the hospital and they get an MRI.
Never see that scene.
I think you're overthinking this.
You know, I love sports, I love the Stooges.
We've got this covered.
No.
No, you-- you got it covered, but I'm just stuck on the sidelines, pretending to understand the rules, and...
You know, my dad was a rough-and-tumble guy, and I just-- I could never relate to him.
And I don't know.
I just don't think I could handle disappointing...
two generations.
I think you're more masculine than you give yourself credit for.
Who puts a birdhouse next to a porch?
Claire, I know that you're worried that Dylan is gonna break Haley's heart, but I see in his eyes that he's gonna stick with her forever.
No matter what, he's always going to be with her.
On your deathbed--
Okay.
All right.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm gonna go find her.
No.
You push too hard, you chase her right into his arms, you'll end up with a boob for a son-in-law.
Believe me, you don't want that.
What's that supposed to mean?
- What?
- Hey, have you guys seen Dylan?
- No.
No.
Why?
- I'm not talking to you.
He said he was going out for a walk last night, and no one's seen him since.
Sweetheart, I'm sure he's fine.
Maybe after last night, he just went home.
Doubt it.
He left his luggage.
We have to do something.
If he doesn't eat five times a day, he gets spacey.
What would that even look like?
We'll find him.
Hank?
We got a situation here!
What seems to be the trouble?
We need to talk.
What?
You stole my first kiss.
What are you talkin' about?
I had it all planned out.
It was supposed to be special, someone with a high GPA and a bright future, not a Mario brother.
Fine.
You know what?
I don't even want your kiss.
Here, you can have it back.
There.
Now we're even.
Well, keep it.
I don't-
- I don't want it anymore.
What am I doing?
Okay, people.
Looks like we have a walker.
Right now he is facing treacherous terrain, sudden drops, mountain lions, hungry bears, oh, and wolverines.
That is, if the hypothermia didn't already get him.
Why did we come here again?
So our best bet is to split up.
You two are gonna take the North hiking trail.
- Can I go with my Dad instead?
- Negative.
I need Buffalo Phil and Old-timer...
To check the Snake River.
Buffalo Phil-- worth the wait.
Me and Cactus Flower will ride on up to Destiny Ridge.
Maybe I should ride up there with her.
Negatory.
That trail is for advanced riders only.
We don't need another dead body.
"Another"?
Let's go!
Move 'em out.
Phil, help me saddle my horse, will ya?
Well, look who's suddenly needed by his father-in-law.
Phyllis.
Phil... is.
Hey, Uncle Mitch.
Whatcha doing?
Oh, hey.
Just--just thinkin'.
You know, I've been meaning to tell you, you're a super fun Uncle.
And I'm saying this as a boy.
Uncle Cameron sent you over here, didn't he?
What?
That's hilarious.
No, I love how you and me can joke like this.
Okay, Luke, look, I don't know how much Cam told you, but I don't think this is a problem that you can help me with.
It's...
Okay, good.
I've got my own problem.
What?
What's that?
Can you keep a secret?
I kept a pretty big one for 22 years, so...
I've got this new firecracker, and I can't decide what to blow up.
Oh, Luke, that's dangerous.
I know.
That's what's fun about it.
I don't get boys.
What is so great about destroying things?
It turns stuff into flying chunks of stuff.
Okay, no.
No, g-give it to me.
Come on.
Fine.
I take it back.
You're not that fun.
All right, hey, look, um, we'll do it together, all right?
You just made the best decision of your life.
Okay.
Come on.
Damn it!
Buttercup!
What the hell's wrong with this horse?
Jay.
I want to talk to you about that son-in-law crack you made at breakfast.
- Oh, I didn't mean anything by that.
- I think you did.
I get that I wasn't your first choice to marry Claire, but it's been 18 years, and there hasn't been a day when I wasn't a loyal husband to your daughter and a great dad to your grandkids.
So if we've still got a problem, now it's your problem.
Phil, wait up.
Let me ask you something, man to man.
Okay.
You notice anything funny about the...
Hank character and, uh...
Gloria?
Yeah, he's hitting on her.
Why?
I knew it.
Where are you going?
Destiny Ridge.
Buttercup, ha!
Buttercup, hiya!
Seriously?
Okay.
Okay, it's clear.
- After this, we're gonna have some angry birds.
-Yeah.
It's gonna be "Bye bye Birdie."
It's a big musical from the '60s.
No.
Forget it.
What you said.
Okay.
Okay, go.
That's it?
I'm sorry, buddy.
- I brought that thing all the way from-- whoa!
- Whoa!
Cam, I did a boy thing!
I blew up the birdhouse!
You should have seen it.
It was so awesome.
That's great!
Yeah.
I think I can do this.
I mean, maybe not everything and maybe not right away, and
- not the three stooges...
- No.
I do.
I want a son.
I'm sorry I panicked.
Oh, that's great.
Now maybe we can go back to taking pictures for the book.
Yes!
Pictures of me blowing up stuff!
Okay, I see we've overcorrected.
I know you think I'm the mean mom who wouldn't let you marry your boyfriend, but someday you're gonna realize,
I-I did what had to be done.
No, you didn't.
I was never gonna marry Dylan.
I told him no.
Oh, you did?
Thank God.
But it was my proposal to turn down.
You know, you keep telling me to act like an adult, but then you don't even give me a chance.
Oh.
You sort of got me there.
But, sweetheart, I don't expect you to understand this.
I certainly didn't when I was your age.
I look at you as my baby, and I always will.
It's--it's just what moms do.
I'm not a baby anymore!
Okay?
And I am never gonna see Dylan again!
Dylan!
Dylan!
What?
!
Where are you?
!
Wyoming!
You're okay!
I had the craziest night.
When you rejected me, I felt lost and scared.
And then I went out on a walk, and I felt a whole different kind of lost and scared.
And then I fell asleep in the stable.
And when I woke up, I met this woman named Jake who's strong like a man.
Then we had this long talk, and he/she hired me.
Uh, what-- what do you mean, she hired you?
I work here now.
S-so you're staying?
Yeah.
What about us?
It could never work.
We're from two different worlds.
You're a high school student, and I'm a ranch hand.
I'm just--I'm so glad you're okay.
I really am.
I am.
Thanks.
But we're not supposed to fraternize with the guests.

You got a voice like a meadowlark, don't ya?

Oh, come on now.
You come up here for the cowboy experience.
You're looking at him.
Do I look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband?
Yes.

Hey!
I think you better move away from that woman.

Easy.

- Ease that one over to Bossy.
Which one's Bossy?
- That's my nickname for your wife.
- Hilarious.
Go, Mom!
Whoo!
Yeah, Mom!
You rock!
Oh, I wish I had a rock.
Hey.
It wouldn't kill you to be nice to Dylan.
It might.
But, honey, I don't know why you always stick up for him.
Haley can do so much better.
Because I know what it's like to fall for a girl whose dad thinks I'm not good enough.
All right, you're right.
I can make more of an effort.
That's the woman I love.
We taking a little break over here?
Laying some pipe?
- No.
Sorry.
I was just talking to Bossy.
- Uh-huh.
- Phil!
- I'm sorry.
Jay, look!
I got this one!
I got this one!
She's veering left again.
When we get back, I'm gonna see if she can track a pencil with her eyes.
Okay, Lily, I'm going to push you one more time.
Now don't kick me, okay?
Aah!
Oh!
Lily!
I said don't kick me.
Okay?
You know it's your own fault that's happening.
Why don't you try standing behind her?
You are an idiot.
Oh, really?
I ain't the one getting kicked.
- Why are you following me?
- Why are you fighting me here, gorgeous?
This works.
I really, really don't appreciate you calling me "gorgeous."
I just want to enjoy time with my family, so if you don't mind-- mm!
Not a problem.
See you around, sunshine.
You kissed a boy!
No, the boy kissed me.
Okay, Lily?
The boy kissed me.
♪ I rode a horse for the first time today ♪

Okay.
Hey, Dylan.
Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.
I was wondering if we could have a little chat.
Oh.
You want me to go home.
No, no.
It's the-- the opposite of that.
I want you to go home?
No, I, um, I want you to know how glad I am that you're here.
Really?
'Cause sometimes I just get this vibe you don't like me.
Oh.
Dylan, no.
I'm sorry.
I-I like you.
I-I like you a lot.
I just...
It's complicated because Haley's my daughter.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
You are totally a hot mom, but I can't do this.
Oh, my God.
Okay, we-- there's--no, no.
I merely meant that I'm sorry if I made you feel unwelcome.
Whew!
That would have been awkward.
So awkward.
You know, but for the record, Mrs. Dunphy...
Yes?
- If Haley wasn't my girlfriend...
- Yeah.
- And Mr. Dunphy was out of the picture...
- Mm-hmm.
I would be honored to share your bed and raise Luke, Alex, and Haley as my own.
Okay.
Good talk.

Heads up.

- Oh, my gosh.
Oh.
It was--it was dark.
I-I couldn't see it.
Thank you.
So did you set off the firecracker yet?
When I do, you won't have to ask.
First, all the electronics will go out, then comes the heat flash.
Afterwards, the living will envy the dead.
And yet I'm the one on the "No-fly" list.
You know what?
Maybe next time I'll just catch it and then hand it to you.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, let's do that.
You--you do everything, and I'll do nothing.
Something on your mind?
This isn't the right place to talk about it.
Okay.
I-I'm s--
I'm not sure if we should have another baby.
What?
Are you serious?
I think that we might be rushing into this.
Rushing into-- we've been working--
Everybody, it's me, Dylan.
I just wanted to thank you all for bringing me on this trip and making me feel like one of the family, uh, especially Bossy.
So I can't think of a better time to ask something of the woman that I love.
Okay.
No, no.
Haley Gwendolyn Dunphy, will you do me the honors of being my lawfully wedded--
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
No proposals.
Not now.
Not gonna happen.
She's a child, so...
- Mom!
- You're still in high school!
- I meant after she graduates.
- Not then.
Not now.
Not ever.
Seriously, what are you two gonna live off of?
The--the--the royalties from the horsey song?
- Put it back in your pocket.
- Would you stop it?
- No, I won't.
I won't.
- No, it's okay.
I guess I'll just turn in.
Just so you know, there's a fan in my cabin
- that sounds like someone crying.
- Oh.
Dylan, wait!
I hate you!
Oh, come on.
Haley, get back here!
Phil, anything?
I think you said it all, Claire.
You want me to rope her?
I can, you know.
For what it's worth, my second wife was in high school.
Sweetie, here.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
- Gone.
- It's gone!
It's over there!
It's not back there.
- We counted to three.
- Yes.
Hey.
Where have you been?
I-I slept on the couch in the lodge.
I know you didn't want to have a big fight last night.
Well, I'm ready now.
Cam, I'm sorry.
Look, what if I can't do the father-son stuff?
The hunting, the--the sports, the Three Stooges?
You know what happens in real life when someone gets hit in the head with a ladder?
They go to the hospital and they get an MRI.
Never see that scene.
I think you're overthinking this.
You know, I love sports, I love the Stooges.
We've got this covered.
No.
No, you-- you got it covered, but I'm just stuck on the sidelines, pretending to understand the rules, and...
You know, my dad was a rough-and-tumble guy, and I just-- I could never relate to him.
And I don't know.
I just don't think I could handle disappointing...
two generations.
I think you're more masculine than you give yourself credit for.
Who puts a birdhouse next to a porch?
Claire, I know that you're worried that Dylan is gonna break Haley's heart, but I see in his eyes that he's gonna stick with her forever.
No matter what, he's always going to be with her.
On your deathbed--
Okay.
All right.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm gonna go find her.
No.
You push too hard, you chase her right into his arms, you'll end up with a boob for a son-in-law.
Believe me, you don't want that.
What's that supposed to mean?
- What?
- Hey, have you guys seen Dylan?
- No.
No.
Why?
- I'm not talking to you.
He said he was going out for a walk last night, and no one's seen him since.
Sweetheart, I'm sure he's fine.
Maybe after last night, he just went home.
Doubt it.
He left his luggage.
We have to do something.
If he doesn't eat five times a day, he gets spacey.
What would that even look like?
We'll find him.
Hank?
We got a situation here!
What seems to be the trouble?
We need to talk.
What?
You stole my first kiss.
What are you talkin' about?
I had it all planned out.
It was supposed to be special, someone with a high GPA and a bright future, not a Mario brother.
Fine.
You know what?
I don't even want your kiss.
Here, you can have it back.
There.
Now we're even.
Well, keep it.
I don't-
- I don't want it anymore.
What am I doing?
Okay, people.
Looks like we have a walker.
Right now he is facing treacherous terrain, sudden drops, mountain lions, hungry bears, oh, and wolverines.
That is, if the hypothermia didn't already get him.
Why did we come here again?
So our best bet is to split up.
You two are gonna take the North hiking trail.
- Can I go with my Dad instead?
- Negative.
I need Buffalo Phil and Old-timer...
To check the Snake River.
Buffalo Phil-- worth the wait.
Me and Cactus Flower will ride on up to Destiny Ridge.
Maybe I should ride up there with her.
Negatory.
That trail is for advanced riders only.
We don't need another dead body.
"Another"?
Let's go!
Move 'em out.
Phil, help me saddle my horse, will ya?
Well, look who's suddenly needed by his father-in-law.
Phyllis.
Phil... is.
Hey, Uncle Mitch.
Whatcha doing?
Oh, hey.
Just--just thinkin'.
You know, I've been meaning to tell you, you're a super fun Uncle.
And I'm saying this as a boy.
Uncle Cameron sent you over here, didn't he?
What?
That's hilarious.
No, I love how you and me can joke like this.
Okay, Luke, look, I don't know how much Cam told you, but I don't think this is a problem that you can help me with.
It's...
Okay, good.
I've got my own problem.
What?
What's that?
Can you keep a secret?
I kept a pretty big one for 22 years, so...
I've got this new firecracker, and I can't decide what to blow up.
Oh, Luke, that's dangerous.
I know.
That's what's fun about it.
I don't get boys.
What is so great about destroying things?
It turns stuff into flying chunks of stuff.
Okay, no.
No, g-give it to me.
Come on.
Fine.
I take it back.
You're not that fun.
All right, hey, look, um, we'll do it together, all right?
You just made the best decision of your life.
Okay.
Come on.
Damn it!
Buttercup!
What the hell's wrong with this horse?
Jay.
I want to talk to you about that son-in-law crack you made at breakfast.
- Oh, I didn't mean anything by that.
- I think you did.
I get that I wasn't your first choice to marry Claire, but it's been 18 years, and there hasn't been a day when I wasn't a loyal husband to your daughter and a great dad to your grandkids.
So if we've still got a problem, now it's your problem.
Phil, wait up.
Let me ask you something, man to man.
Okay.
You notice anything funny about the...
Hank character and, uh...
Gloria?
Yeah, he's hitting on her.
Why?
I knew it.
Where are you going?
Destiny Ridge.
Buttercup, ha!
Buttercup, hiya!
Seriously?
Okay.
Okay, it's clear.
- After this, we're gonna have some angry birds.
-Yeah.
It's gonna be "Bye bye Birdie."
It's a big musical from the '60s.
No.
Forget it.
What you said.
Okay.
Okay, go.
That's it?
I'm sorry, buddy.
- I brought that thing all the way from-- whoa!
- Whoa!
Cam, I did a boy thing!
I blew up the birdhouse!
You should have seen it.
It was so awesome.
That's great!
Yeah.
I think I can do this.
I mean, maybe not everything and maybe not right away, and
- not the three stooges...
- No.
I do.
I want a son.
I'm sorry I panicked.
Oh, that's great.
Now maybe we can go back to taking pictures for the book.
Yes!
Pictures of me blowing up stuff!
Okay, I see we've overcorrected.
I know you think I'm the mean mom who wouldn't let you marry your boyfriend, but someday you're gonna realize,
I-I did what had to be done.
No, you didn't.
I was never gonna marry Dylan.
I told him no.
Oh, you did?
Thank God.
But it was my proposal to turn down.
You know, you keep telling me to act like an adult, but then you don't even give me a chance.
Oh.
You sort of got me there.
But, sweetheart, I don't expect you to understand this.
I certainly didn't when I was your age.
I look at you as my baby, and I always will.
It's--it's just what moms do.
I'm not a baby anymore!
Okay?
And I am never gonna see Dylan again!
Dylan!
Dylan!
What?
!
Where are you?
!
Wyoming!
You're okay!
I had the craziest night.
When you rejected me, I felt lost and scared.
And then I went out on a walk, and I felt a whole different kind of lost and scared.
And then I fell asleep in the stable.
And when I woke up, I met this woman named Jake who's strong like a man.
Then we had this long talk, and he/she hired me.
Uh, what-- what do you mean, she hired you?
I work here now.
S-so you're staying?
Yeah.
What about us?
It could never work.
We're from two different worlds.
You're a high school student, and I'm a ranch hand.
I'm just--I'm so glad you're okay.
I really am.
I am.
Thanks.
But we're not supposed to fraternize with the guests.
Right.
Dylan!
Dylan!
You got a voice like a meadowlark, don't ya?
Dylan!
Yeah, I sure am worried about that kid.
Dylan!
He ain't down there.
Oh, come on now.
You come up here for the cowboy experience.
You're looking at him.
Do I look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband?
Yes.
Really?
Hey!
I think you better move away from that woman.
Only we touch our women when they don't want us to.
Easy.
Easy there, friend-o.
I wasn't hitting on this filly.
This is all part of the package.
If I didn't play the bad guy, he wouldn't get to ride up and be the big hero.
He doesn't need you to make him a hero.
He's a hero every day.
Why don't you do us all a favor?
Get back on your horse, ride down to the lodge and tell 'em--
- Can you keep him still?
I'm trying to make a point.
- I am.
Okay.
Okay, I'm gone.
Ma'am.
Wait.
Wait.
There's something I wanna say to you.
I will only be checking "somewhat satisfied"
on our comment card.
Jeez.
I mean, he was great with the kids.
I looked it up.
The distance between our houses is 2,443 miles.
Yeah, but, you know, on some maps, it's like--pfft!
This big.
God, you're stupid.
All in all, it was a great vacation.
We may have lost a man...
But out there on the range, under that great big sky, we found a part of ourselves we never knew was there, just like the horny cowboy said we would.
No.
Fine.
We're beginning our initial descent into Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Thank you for flying United.
Reckon we'll be landing soon.
Phil, honey, you promised-- not till we got there.
This year, we're going to a dude ranch with the whole family.
Mm-hmm.
The family.
What if Dylan buys his own ticket?
We'll be sleeping in separate cabins.
What if Dylan and I share a horse?
Mm, I hate landing.
We'll get through this.
Wow!
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing?
I want my ears to pop.
Try putting a little Rouge on 'em.
Nobody gets me.
Wow.
Isn't this beautiful, little cowgirl?
You hate her sparkly outfit, don't you?
No, I told you, it's fine.
I just didn't like you wearing a matching one.
So we haven't told the family yet, but we've decided to adopt a baby boy.
From America this time.
You might say we're "buying domestic."
In private...
You might say that in private.
Our adoption attorney told us it would be a good idea to make a photo book to show prospective moms.
Ues, but he thought that Cam's version was a little too "artsy,"
so we've decided to take a few rugged shots at the ranch to, you know, balance it out.
I don't think it need balancing out.
Really?
It's called "Production value."
Horse.
Look, Jay!
So beautiful!
Your ears haven't popped yet, huh?
I'm like the horse whisperer.
But something is making this one skittish.
Whoa.
Look at the mountains.
They're amazing.
I've never been this far from home before now I've never been this far.
Where's a cliff when you need one?
Look, kids!
A real life cowboy!
Oh.
Come see.
Come see.
- Uh-oh.
- What's he doing?
Oh, my.
My name is Hank.
Here at the Lost Creek Ranch, you're gonna ride, you're gonna rope, and you're gonna shoot.
You're gonna see a sky so full of stars, it'll put your city lights to shame.
And when it's all done, you might just encounter a piece of yourselves you never knew was there.
Are there any questions?
Uh, do we book spa treatments through you or...
I like you, kid.
I'm gonna call you "Hollywood."
That wasn't an answer.
And who's this cactus flower?
What?
That's my wife Gloria.
Well, she's "Cactus Flower" now, old-timer.
These, uh, these nicknames-- are they set in stone?
Okey dokey.
You ready, gunslinger?
I heard word of trouble in these parts.
Pull!
That oughta fix it, eh, Jay?
You got a piece of it.
I've been practicing like crazy, all my cowboy skills-- shootin', ropin'.
pancake eating'.
Why?
Because sometimes
I feel like Jay doesn't respect me as a man.
It's just that when you say, "Phil is my son-in-law,"
it sounds like you're saying, "Phyllis, my son-in-law."
- That's ridiculous.
- Okay, who's your son-in-law?
Phyllis.
I'm not asking for a hug.
I just want to get that look of newfound respect, like...
Or...
Or... mm.
Yeah.
Check it out.
Two birds, one leg.
Pull it!
Not bad, eh, Old-timer?
Uh, see, slappy only had three fingers.
What?
He only had three fingers.
Who's next?
Oh, me.
Me.
Oh, this is good.
This is good.
Tres macho.
No smile.
Don't smile.
Good.
You ready?
Wait.
Do I say "pull"?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Mitchell, why don't you go find Manny at the spa?
Wouldn't that be more fun?
Yeah.
I realized that if I was gonna raise a boy,
I needed to butch up my life.
You know, I wanted to be able to teach my son all the things that my Dad taught Claire.
Hey, Hollywood.
I don't love that.
Wanna see something?
Oh, my gosh.
Is that a firecracker?
Shh!
Now I just need to find the perfect thing to blow up.
Is that thing even legal?
Not here.
It's from Germany.
If they had this during the war, right now we'd all be knee-deep in strudel.
Watch it!
What you doing, eh?
You reading'?
Trying to.
I'm not so good at it either.
- I'm not surprised.
- That was a joke.
I'm Jimmy Scrivano.
You want to see me do a cannonball?
I'd rather see you get hit by one, but...
Ha.
Good one, gorgeous.
Jay!
Is this like the lobster?
!
Do I get to pick one for dinner?
Because this one looks very tender.
Look alive, Old-timer.
One of your calves is getting away.
Hey, something's wrong with my horse.
She's veering left.
When this happened to my Uncle, it was a stroke.
Oh, there's nothing wrong with Buttercup.
You just gotta let her know who's boss!
Beautiful form, Cactus Flower!
Beautiful!
You look like a dadgum conquistadora!
She's deaf, but I can hear ya.
Why are you riding that way?
I'm afraid that cow over there might bite me.
Oh, yes, he's gonna come up and bite you because your leg looks so desirable with those-- are those canvas?
Okay, Phil, ease that one back over towards me.
- Got it.
- Ease him back this way.
Hey!
Piece of cake, huh, Jay?
- Huh?
- Ease that one over to Bossy.
Which one's Bossy?
- That's my nickname for your wife.
- Hilarious.
Go, Mom!
Whoo!
Yeah, Mom!
You rock!
Oh, I wish I had a rock.

Maybe after last night, he just went home.
Doubt it.
He left his luggage.
We have to do something.
If he doesn't eat five times a day, he gets spacey.
What would that even look like?
We'll find him.
Hank?
We got a situation here!
What seems to be the trouble?
We need to talk.
What?
You stole my first kiss.
What are you talkin' about?
I had it all planned out.
It was supposed to be special, someone with a high GPA and a bright future, not a Mario brother.
Fine.
You know what?
I don't even want your kiss.
Here, you can have it back.
There.
Now we're even.
Well, keep it.
I don't-
- I don't want it anymore.
What am I doing?
Okay, people.
Looks like we have a walker.
Right now he is facing treacherous terrain, sudden drops, mountain lions, hungry bears, oh, and wolverines.
That is, if the hypothermia didn't already get him.
Why did we come here again?
So our best bet is to split up.
You two are gonna take the North hiking trail.
- Can I go with my Dad instead?
- Negative.
I need Buffalo Phil and Old-timer...
To check the Snake River.
Buffalo Phil-- worth the wait.
Me and Cactus Flower will ride on up to Destiny Ridge.
Maybe I should ride up there with her.
Negatory.
That trail is for advanced riders only.
We don't need another dead body.
"Another"?
Let's go!
Move 'em out.
Phil, help me saddle my horse, will ya?
Well, look who's suddenly needed by his father-in-law.
Phyllis.
Phil... is.
Hey, Uncle Mitch.
Whatcha doing?
Oh, hey.
Just--just thinkin'.
You know, I've been meaning to tell you, you're a super fun Uncle.
And I'm saying this as a boy.
Uncle Cameron sent you over here, didn't he?
What?
That's hilarious.
No, I love how you and me can joke like this.
Okay, Luke, look, I don't know how much Cam told you, but I don't think this is a problem that you can help me with.
It's...
Okay, good.
I've got my own problem.
What?
What's that?
Can you keep a secret?
I kept a pretty big one for 22 years, so...
I've got this new firecracker, and I can't decide what to blow up.
Oh, Luke, that's dangerous.
I know.
That's what's fun about it.
I don't get boys.
What is so great about destroying things?
It turns stuff into flying chunks of stuff.
Okay, no.
No, g-give it to me.
Come on.
Fine.
I take it back.
You're not that fun.
All right, hey, look, um, we'll do it together, all right?
You just made the best decision of your life.
Okay.
Come on.
Damn it!
Buttercup!
What the hell's wrong with this horse?
Jay.
I want to talk to you about that son-in-law crack you made at breakfast.
- Oh, I didn't mean anything by that.
- I think you did.
I get that I wasn't your first choice to marry Claire, but it's been 18 years, and there hasn't been a day when I wasn't a loyal husband to your daughter and a great dad to your grandkids.
So if we've still got a problem, now it's your problem.
Phil, wait up.
Let me ask you something, man to man.
Okay.
You notice anything funny about the...
Hank character and, uh...
Gloria?
Yeah, he's hitting on her.
Why?
I knew it.
Where are you going?
Destiny Ridge.
Buttercup, ha!
Buttercup, hiya!
Seriously?
Okay.
Okay, it's clear.
- After this, we're gonna have some angry birds.
-Yeah.
It's gonna be "Bye bye Birdie."
It's a big musical from the '60s.
No.
Forget it.
What you said.
Okay.
Okay, go.
That's it?
I'm sorry, buddy.
- I brought that thing all the way from-- whoa!
- Whoa!
Cam, I did a boy thing!
I blew up the birdhouse!
You should have seen it.
It was so awesome.
That's great!
Yeah.
I think I can do this.
I mean, maybe not everything and maybe not right away, and
- not the three stooges...
- No.
I do.
I want a son.
I'm sorry I panicked.
Oh, that's great.
Now maybe we can go back to taking pictures for the book.
Yes!
Pictures of me blowing up stuff!
Okay, I see we've overcorrected.
I know you think I'm the mean mom who wouldn't let you marry your boyfriend, but someday you're gonna realize,
I-I did what had to be done.
No, you didn't.
I was never gonna marry Dylan.
I told him no.
Oh, you did?
Thank God.
But it was my proposal to turn down.
You know, you keep telling me to act like an adult, but then you don't even give me a chance.
Oh.
You sort of got me there.
But, sweetheart, I don't expect you to understand this.
I certainly didn't when I was your age.
I look at you as my baby, and I always will.
It's--it's just what moms do.
I'm not a baby anymore!
Okay?
And I am never gonna see Dylan again!
Dylan!
Dylan!
What?
!
Where are you?
!
Wyoming!
You're okay!
I had the craziest night.
When you rejected me, I felt lost and scared.
And then I went out on a walk, and I felt a whole different kind of lost and scared.
And then I fell asleep in the stable.
And when I woke up, I met this woman named Jake who's strong like a man.
Then we had this long talk, and he/she hired me.
Uh, what-- what do you mean, she hired you?
I work here now.
S-so you're staying?
Yeah.
What about us?
It could never work.
We're from two different worlds.
You're a high school student, and I'm a ranch hand.
I'm just--I'm so glad you're okay.
I really am.
I am.
Thanks.
But we're not supposed to fraternize with the guests.
Right.
Dylan!
Dylan!
You got a voice like a meadowlark, don't ya?
Dylan!
Yeah, I sure am worried about that kid.
Dylan!
He ain't down there.
Oh, come on now.
You come up here for the cowboy experience.
You're looking at him.
Do I look like the kind of woman that would cheat on her husband?
Yes.
Really?
Hey!
I think you better move away from that woman.
Only we touch our women when they don't want us to.
Easy.
Easy there, friend-o.
I wasn't hitting on this filly.
This is all part of the package.
If I didn't play the bad guy, he wouldn't get to ride up and be the big hero.
He doesn't need you to make him a hero.
He's a hero every day.
Why don't you do us all a favor?
Get back on your horse, ride down to the lodge and tell 'em--
- Can you keep him still?
I'm trying to make a point.
- I am.
Okay.
Okay, I'm gone.
Ma'am.
Wait.
Wait.
There's something I wanna say to you.
I will only be checking "somewhat satisfied"
on our comment card.
Jeez.
I mean, he was great with the kids.
I looked it up.
The distance between our houses is 2,443 miles.
Yeah, but, you know, on some maps, it's like--pfft!
This big.
God, you're stupid.
All in all, it was a great vacation.
We may have lost a man...
But out there on the range, under that great big sky, we found a part of ourselves we never knew was there, just like the horny cowboy said we would.
No.
Fine.
Previously on Vampire Diaries:
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
The key to the curse.
Klaus is a vampire born from a werewolf bloodline.
The curse kept his werewolf from manifesting.
He'll be vulnerable during the transformation, when Bonnie comes in.
If she can deliver him to the brink of death, I'll finish the job.
I had a family.
Klaus hunted them down one by one.
He scattered them where their bodies could not be found.
I didn't bury them at sea.
Their bodies are safe.
If you kill me, you'll never find them.
No!
Who's gonna save your life while you're making decisions?
- I don't want to be saved.
- There is a way.
What are you...?
Damon, no.
I fed her my blood.
She'll come back a vampire.
How could you?
She'll never forgive you.
- Tyler Lockwood bit me.
- A werewolf bite can kill a vampire.
That'll get easier.
But you know that.
What do you want?
I wanna apologize.
- Damon...
- Please.
Elena, feeding you my blood, I was wrong.
Yes, you were.
And I know I don't deserve your forgiveness but I need it.
And I need some time maybe a lot of time.
Sure.
Of course.
Take all the time you need.
Get off of me.
You're not doing this.
Just did.
You know what happened to Rose, Stefan.
I don't care.
You're not dying today.
What's the plan, Superman?
- I'm gonna find a way out of this.
- Oh, right.
A miracle cure.
Good luck with that one.
I got Bonnie looking for something, anything.
Always the hero, Stefan.
Just tell me goodbye, get it over with.
Lie still.
Conserve your strength.
You've been busy.
That was amazing.
How long has it been?
Almost two days.
Full moon came and went.
You remained a wolf.
I can change at will then.
That's good to know.
I remember every single kill.
Yes, I've been cleaning up your mess.
Just like old times, brother.
Well, you've had your fun.
I believe we have a bargain.
That's right.
Now, what was it again?
Oh, yeah, wait.
I remember.
That's it.
You wish to be reunited with our family.
You gave me your word, Niklaus.
What kind of brother would break his bond?
Even though you did try to kill me.
I could have.
But I didn't.
Now no one can, not even you.
Relax, Elijah.
All is forgiven.
Where are they?
You need to lighten up.
I'll bring you to them soon enough.
You've reached somebody who's currently not operating.
I need your help.
You have me confused with somebody else.
I'm not allowed to help just idly sit by while my girlfriend gets sacrificed on an altar of blood.
Damon's dying.
- What?
- Tyler Lockwood bit him.
We don't have much time.
What do you need?
You brought me to see a girl movie.
We had to get out of the house, Jer.
This is our three-hour distraction from reality.
Is that what we're doing?
Pretending our lives aren't screwed?
We need to do this, okay?
Breathe, eat, sleep, wake up and do it all over again until one day, it's just not as hard anymore.
Hey.
There you guys are.
- Who's hungry?
- Are we really doing this?
Yes, we are really doing this.
Yeah, we're going to take a page from Scarlett.
We made it through the war.
I know you guys went through hell, and my mom knows I am a vampire so basically, it's like Atlanta has burned.
And yet, in spite of everything, we persevere.
All right.
What are we eating?
Something good.
I'm not sure this is gonna work.
You've done a séance before, right?
Contacted Emily Bennett.
Maybe one of the witches know how to help Damon.
Let's just hope they want to.
Bonnie?
Bonnie?
Emily.
Why have you come here, Stefan?
I need your help.
I need to know if there's a spell that can heal a werewolf bite.
No.
Nature ensures a balance to everything.
Is that true?
Or are you just saying no because it's Damon?
Perhaps it is his time to die.
No.
That's not balance that's punishment.
I will not give you what you want.
So you're saying that there's an answer to give?
Please.
If you know something, just tell me.
Help me save my brother.
Bonnie.
They don't want us here.
They think I'm abusing their power.
They know something.
There's an answer.
- They just don't wanna tell me.
- Yeah.
I heard them say a name.
What was it?
Klaus.
Carol, hi.
How you feeling?
Better, thank goodness.
It was a terrible fall.
Shouldn't you be resting?
I've been resting.
Now I'm ready to work.
Update me on where we are with the vampire situation.
Well, there's been some developments, but I'm handling it.
Are you?
I left you in charge of this town's safety and I'm not seeing any results.
I said, I'm handling it.
Then see that you do, sheriff because if you can't, I'll find someone who will.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Look who couldn't resist an epic romance.
Will you come take a walk with me?
You're breaking the rules, you know.
Movie night's supposed to be a distraction.
Tomorrow we can return to our regularly-scheduled drama.
I know, I wish this could wait, but it can't.
Listen, um the other night when Damon was helping Tyler, something happened.
Tyler was starting to transform and Damon was bitten.
What?
Is it...?
Is he gonna...?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
He came to the house this morning and tried to apologize.
I practically slammed the door in his face.
He told me not to tell you, but I figured if you wanted to talk to him...
I wouldn't wait.
- Stefan...
- It's not over.
There might be a cure.
- But I have to find Klaus to get it.
- No, he's gonna kill you.
No, he had the chance to kill me, but he didn't.
Whatever Damon's done, whatever's led him here I'm the one that made him become a vampire in the first place.
So if there's a chance for a cure, I owe it to him to find it.
Go talk to him.
Just tell him that there's still hope.
Mr. Salvatore, spying on a lady is a sign of very poor manners.
My apologies, Miss Katherine.
But since you are here my corset strings seem to be knotted.
I wonder if you can undo them.
Of course.
Will you miss me while off defending the South?
- I shall.
- Then I hope you will hurry back.
I fear I will be lonely with you away.
I would think Stefan should be company enough.
Is it so wrong for me to want you both?
Damon.
- Elena?
- Don't you see?
She was toying with you.
All you had to do was say no, walk away.
You had a choice.
Promise me that you will return quickly.
I promise.
- Hello, Katherine.
- Two days, I've been waiting.
I'm supposed to be free of Klaus' compulsion by now.
- He's supposed to be dead.
- We ran into complications.
- Complications?
- Doesn't really matter.
I just need to find him.
Do you have any idea where he might be?
Klaus, you're back.
Look who decided to come for a visit.
You just keep popping up, don't you?
I need your help.
For my brother.
Whatever it is, is gonna have to wait.
You see, I have an obligation to my brother that requires my immediate attention.
You understand how important family is or you wouldn't be here.
My brother gave me his word that he would reunite me with my own.
And so I shall.
Shh.
Now, what am I gonna do with you?
Do you feel that?
It's scraping against your heart.
The slightest little movement and you're dead.
He's just trying to help his brother.
The witches said you had a cure.
Make me a deal.
Just give me the cure and I'll do whatever you want.
Trouble is I don't know if you'd be any good to me the way you are now.
You're just shy of useless.
- Well, that looks bad.
- It feels worse.
My subconscious is haunting me, Ric.
Please tell me you have something for that.
Heh.
Double shot.
That's good.
Oh, good.
So my brother sent you for suicide watch?
He's just trying to help.
He's doing what he always does trying to right the wrongs of the past.
Ugh.
You should want me dead.
I'm the reason Jenna got killed.
- I don't blame you for Jenna.
- Oh, sure you do.
Let's not forget I turned your wife into a vampire.
- You must really hate me for that one.
- Okay, give me your glass.
Neither one of us is drunk enough for this conversation.
Kill me.
Please.
Screw you.
No.
Elena?
Elena's not here, Damon.
Don't make a sound.
I need blood.
I need blood.
Where's Damon?
Now's not a good time, sheriff.
Trust me.
- Sheriff, over here.
- I wouldn't go in there.
- I just wanna talk to him.
- I wouldn't go in there.
Liz.
All this waiting around for news is ruining Scarlett for me.
- Alaric, hey.
- Tell me you're with Elena.
She went to see Damon, I thought that's where you were.
He escaped.
He's looking for her.
The cops are after him.
He's in bad shape.
If you find her get her somewhere safe, okay?
I'm on my way.
If Damon is off the rails, there is nothing you can do to stop him.
- Let us take care of it.
- You keep doing this.
You left me behind before and Jenna still died.
Now, I'm going to find my sister.
You go ahead and try to stop me.
I heard about this one vampire, crazy bloke always on and off the wagon for decades.
When he was off, he was magnificent.
1917, he went into Monterey and wiped out an entire migrant village.
A true ripper.
Sound familiar?
I haven't been that way in a very long time.
Well, that's the vampire I can make a deal with.
That is the kind of talent that I can use when I leave this town.
Katerina, come here.
No.
No.
No.
No, no.
You want your cure?
There it is.
Your blood is the cure.
Gotta love Mother Nature.
Now let's talk, you and I.
Katherine?
Damon.
Where's Elena?
I need to see Elena now.
Hey, let's get you out of here first, all right?
Hey.
Where's Damon?
What have you done to him?
Why do you even care?
You know what they are, what they do.
I understand why you hate them, but you're wrong.
They're murderers, Elena.
End of story.
Damon Salvatore was spotted outside entering the Grill.
Wait.
You gotta let me come with you.
He's sick.
He's...
He's not himself.
Keep her here.
Hey, it's me.
I'm with Damon at the Grill.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
I've got a gunshot victim at the Grill.
Get paramedics.
You're gonna be fine.
- Jeremy.
- It's gonna be okay.
What did you do?
I was aiming for Damon.
- He still has his ring.
- She's human.
The ring won't work.
- Caroline...
- I got it.
Come on, Jeremy.
Just drink.
Jeremy, drink.
- What are you doing?
- Helping him.
- Jeremy, drink.
- Please.
Please.
Bonnie, what's going on?
Oh, my God.
I know what I need to do.
I need you to grab him.
- Take him with us.
- No, no, no, you can't move him.
- This is a crime scene.
- Mom, let them go.
Okay.
All right.
Come here, buddy.
I got you.
I got you.
There it is.
You wanna save your brother?
How about a decade-Iong bender?
You know I have big plans for you when we leave this town.
I'm not like that anymore.
Well, that's too bad.
You would have made a hell of a wingman.
Wait.
Now, that's more like it.
I want you to join me for a drink.
Finish it.
All of it.
You do everything I say and I save your brother.
That's the deal.
Again.
Is this even possible?
There's a spell for it if they'll give me the power to use it.
- No.
- What?
What is it?
They're angry at me for coming back here.
They don't wanna help.
- Well, they have to.
- They said there will be consequences.
Well, he's just a kid.
Tell them to shut up.
Emily.
Emily.
I know you're there.
Please help me.
I love him.
No.
- Oh, my God.
- Bonnie?
Oh, my God, Jeremy.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.
What happened?
Doesn't matter.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Thank you.
- Much for the Yankees to take.
We'll have to make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition.
Elena.
Damon.
Come on.
We have to get you out of here.
We have to hide you.
- Where are we going?
- Everywhere.
Wait for me.
I wanna come with you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Relax.
- We need to get you out of here.
- You're faster than I thought.
- Why must you always run?
Because I know you will chase.
Then let me chase you forever.
Will you feed me your blood?
I will not feed you, Damon.
If you want it, take it.
It is your choice to make.
I choose you, Katherine.
Look at me.
Hey.
It's Elena.
It's Elena.
- Promise me you will not tell my brother.
- I promise.
It will be our little secret.
No.
Damon.
No.
I have to, if we are to be together forever.
Damon, stop.
You're hurting me.
Damon, you don't have to do this.
Please stop.
You're hurting me.
Elena.
Damon.
Damon.
That was Bonnie.
Jeremy's alive.
I thought I killed him.
You did.
I don't understand.
I explained it to you once.
But I had to make you forget because I was so scared of what you might do.
But now I don't wanna lie.
I'm not gonna be afraid of you anymore.
And I don't want you to be afraid of me anymore.
I'm still your little girl.
It's me.
It's me.
Mom?
Hey.
What are you doing?
Trying to figure out what's wrong with me.
I feel different, weird.
You were dead.
It would be weird if you felt normal.
Bonnie, I...
I don't know how to thank you.
You can thank me tomorrow.
And the day after that.
And the day after that.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Good night, Jeremy.
- Good night.
Hey, bud.
I was gonna take off.
You need anything?
Uh...
No, no.
I think I'm good.
You know, uh on second thought, I might crash here.
That cool?
Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.
All right.
Alaric, um...
Thank you for everything.
Oh, you can thank me tomorrow.
And the day after that.
- And the day after that.
- Dude, I knew you were listening.
- And the day after that.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Elena.
It's okay, Damon.
I'm right here.
Elena, get out of here.
I could hurt you.
No.
You won't.
I'm here until the very end.
I'm not leaving you.
Get out of here.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.
It's not okay.
All those years, I've blamed Stefan.
No one forced me to love her.
It was my own choice.
Shh.
- I made the wrong choice.
- Hey.
You tell Stefan I'm sorry.
Okay?
I will.
You're very cooperative.
It's almost as if you're enjoying it.
No more.
Not until you give me the cure.
Not until we make a deal.
It's your choice, Stefan.
You can either remain here living your life in Mystic Falls or you can embrace what you truly are.
Leave town with me and save your brother's life.
That's the spirit.
Sweetheart take this over to Damon and come right back.
- You want me to leave?
- No.
Yes.
And if I were you I'd hurry.
She'll never take it to him.
She'll never take it to him.
This is even more pitiful than I thought.
There's still hope.
I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here.
I deserve this.
I deserve to die.
No.
- You don't.
- I do, Elena.
It's okay.
Because if I'd have chosen differently, I wouldn't have met you.
I'm so sorry.
I've done so many things to hurt you.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
I know you love Stefan.
And it will always be Stefan.
But I love you.
You should know that.
I do.
You should have met me in 1864.
You would have liked me.
I like you now.
Just the way you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well, it's me you should be thanking.
I mean, I'm the one who brought the cure.
- I thought you were dead.
- I was.
You got free.
Yep.
Finally.
And you still came here?
I owed you one.
Where's Stefan?
- Are you sure you care?
- Where is he?
He's paying for this.
He gave himself over to Klaus.
- I wouldn't expect him anytime soon.
- What do you mean "gave himself over"?
He just sacrificed everything to save his brother, including you.
It's a good thing you have Damon to keep you company.
Goodbye, Elena.
Oh...
It's okay to love them both.
I did.
I suppose, brother you've been reunited with our family.
Put him with the others.
We're leaving town tonight.
So did Katerina make it in time?
- You won't be seeing her again.
- Because she's on vervain?
I've been around a long time, Stefan.
I rarely get played for a fool.
Besides, she won't get far.
You'll help me see to that.
What is it you really want from me?
All will be explained in time.
Once we leave this tragic little town.
Then are we done here?
- Can we go?
- Not quite.
You see, I have a gift for you.
Come here, sweetheart.
Don't be afraid.
See, I wanna make sure you honor our deal that you'll be of use to me.
I could have compelled her to behave, but a real ripper enjoys the hunt.
Now we can go.
Alaric?
Alaric.
Jer.
Anna?
Vicki?
You must be Elena.
How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
Klaus is a vampire born from a werewolf bloodline.
The curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting.
He'll be vulnerable during the transformation.
That's when Bonnie comes in.
If she can deliver him to the brink of death,
I'll finish the job myself.
I had a family.
Klaus hunted them down one by one.
He scattered them across the seas, where their bodies could not be found.
I didn't bury them at sea.
Their bodies are safe.
If you kill me, you'll never find them.
No!
Who's going to save your life while you're out making decisions?
I don't want to be saved.
There is another way.
What are you...
Damon, no.
I fed her my blood.
She'll come back a vampire.
How could you take that choice away from her?
She'll never forgive you.
Tyler Lockwood bit me.
A werewolf bite can kill a vampire.
That'll get easier.
But you knew that.
What do you want?
I want to apologize.
Damon.
Please.
Elena, feeding you my blood, I was wrong.
Yes, you were.
And I know I don't deserve your forgiveness, but...
I need it.
And I need some time, maybe a lot of time.
True.
Of course.
Take all the time you need.
Get off of me.
You're not doing this.
Just did.
You know what happened to Rose, Stefan.
I don't care.
You're not dying today.
What's the plan, Superman?
I'm gonna find a way out of this.
Oh, right.
A miracle cure.
Good luck with that one.
I got Bonnie looking for something, anything.
Always the hero, Stefan.
Just tell me good-bye, get it over with.
Lie still.
Conserve your strength.
You've been busy.
That was amazing.
How long has it been?
Almost 2 days.
Full moon came and went.
You remained a wolf.
I can change at will, then.
It's good to know.
I remember every single kill.
Yes, I've been cleaning up your little mess along the way.
Just like old times, brother.
You've had your fun.
I believe we have a bargain.
That's right.
Now, what was it again?
Oh, yeah.
Wait.
I remember.
That's it.
You wish to be reunited with our family.
You gave me your word, Niklaus.
What kind of brother would break his bond?
Even though you did try to kill me.
I could have.
But I didn't.
And now no one can, not even you.
Relax, Elijah.
All is forgiven.
Where are they?
You need to lighten up.
I'll bring you to them soon enough.
Sorry, you've reached somebody who's currently not operating.
I need your help.
Well, you must have me confused with somebody else.
You see, I'm not allowed to help, just idly sit by while my girlfriend gets sacrificed on an altar of blood.
Damon's dying.
- What?
- Tyler Lockwood bit him.
We don't have much time.
What do you need?
You brought me to see a girl movie.
We had to get out of the house, Jer.
This is our 3-hour distraction from reality.
Is that what we're doing?
Pretending like our lives aren't screwed?
We need to do this, ok?
Breathe, eat, sleep, wake up, and do it all over again until one day, it's just not as hard anymore.
Hey!
There you guys are.
Who's hungry?
Are we really doing this?
Yes, we are really doing this.
We are going to take a page from Scarlett.
We made it through the war.
I know you guys went through hell, and my mom knows I am a vampire, so basically it's like Atlanta has burned.
And yet, in spite of everything, we persevere.
All right.
What are we eating?
Something good.
I'm not sure this is going to work.
You've done a séance before, right?
Contacted Emily Bennett.
Maybe one of the witches might know how to help Damon.
Let's just hope they want to.
Phesmatos manex un domo hax, fero adiuvex.
Phesmatos manex.
Phesmatos manex un domo hax, fero adiuvex.
Bonnie.
Bonnie.
Emily.
Why have you come here, Stefan?
I need your help.
I need to know if there's a spell that can heal a werewolf bite.
No.
Nature ensures a balance to everything.
Is that true... or are you just saying no because it's Damon?
Perhaps it is his time to die.
No.
That's not balance.
That's punishment.
I will not give you what you want.
So you're saying that there's an answer to give?
Please, if you know something, just tell me.
Help me save my brother.
Aah!
Ohh.
Bonnie.
They don't want us here.
They think I'm abusing their power.
They know something.
There's an answer.
They just don't want to tell me.
Yeah.
I heard them say a name.
What was it?
Klaus.
Carol.
Hi.
How you feeling?
Better, thank goodness.
That was a terrible fall.
Shouldn't you be home resting?
I've been resting, and now I'm ready to get back to work.
I need you to update me on where we are with the vampire situation.
Well, there have been some developments, but I'm handling it.
Are you?
Because I left you in charge of this town's safety, and lately I'm not seeing any results.
I said I'm handling it.
Then see that you do, Sheriff, because if you can't, I'll find someone who will.
Hey.
Hey.
Look who couldn't resist an epic romance.
Will you come take a walk with me?
You're breaking the rules, you know.
Movie night's supposed to be a distraction.
Tomorrow we can return to our regularly scheduled drama.
I know.
I wish this could wait, but it can't.
Listen, um, the other night when Damon was helping Tyler, something happened.
Tyler was starting to transform, and Damon was bitten.
What?
Is it... is he gonna...
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
And he came to the house this morning and... and tried to apologize.
I practically slammed the door in his face.
He told me not to tell you, but I figured if you wanted to talk to him, I...
I wouldn't wait.
Stefan... it's not over.
There might be a cure, but I have to find Klaus to get it.
No.
He's gonna kill you.
No, he had the chance to kill me, but he didn't.
Whatever Damon's done, whatever has led him here,
I'm the one that made him become a vampire in the first place, so if there's a chance for a cure,
I owe it to him to find it.
Go talk to him.
Just tell him that there's still hope.
Mr. Salvatore, spying on a lady is a sign of very poor manners.
My apologies, miss Katherine.
But since you are here, my corset strings seem to be knotted.
I wonder if you can undo them.
Of course.
Will you miss me while off defending the South?
I shall.
Then I hope you will hurry back.
I fear I will be lonely with you away.
I would think Stefan should be company enough.
Is it so wrong for me to want you both?
Damon.
Elena?
Don't you see?
She was toying with you.
All you had to do was say no, walk away.
You had a choice.
Promise me that you will return quickly.
I promise.
Hello, Katherine.
Two days, I've been waiting.
I'm supposed to be free of Klaus' compulsion by now.
He's supposed to be dead.
We ran into complications.
Complications?
Doesn't really matter.
I just need to find him.
Do you have any idea where he might be?
Shh.
Klaus, you're back.
Look who decided to come for a visit.
You just keep popping up, don't you?
I need your help...
For my brother.
Well, whatever it is, he's gonna have to wait a tick.
You see, I have an obligation to my brother that requires my immediate attention.
You understand how important family is, or you wouldn't be here.
My brother gave me his word that he would reunite me with my own.
And so I shall.
Raah!
Shh.
Now, what am I gonna do with you?
Do you feel that?
It's scraping against your heart.
The slightest little movement, and you're dead.
He's just trying to help his brother.
The witches said you had a cure.
Make me a deal.
Just give me the cure, and I'll do whatever you want.
Trouble is I don't know if you'd be any good to me the way you are now.
You are just shy of useless.
Well, that looks bad.
It feels worse.
My subconscious is haunting me, Rick.
Please tell me you have something for that.
Heh.
Double shot.
That's good.
Oh, good.
So my brother sent you for suicide watch?
He's just trying to help.
He's doing what he always does, trying to right the wrongs of the past.
Aah!
You should want me dead.
I'm the reason Jenna got killed.
I don't blame you for Jenna.
Oh, sure you do.
Let's not forget I turned your wife into a vampire.
You must really hate me for that one.
Ok, give me your glass.
Neither one of us is drunk enough for this conversation.
Kill me.
Please.
Screw you.
Aah.
No.
Elena?
Elena's not here, Damon.
Don't make a sound.
I need blood.
I need blood.
Where's Damon?
You know, now's not a good time, Sheriff.
Trust me.
Sheriff, over here.
I wouldn't go in there.
I just wanna talk to him.
I wouldn't go in there.
Liz.
All this waiting around for news is ruining Scarlett for me.
Alaric.
Hey.
Tell me you're with Elena.
She went to go see Damon.
I thought that's where you were.
No, he just escaped.
I think he's looking for her, and the cops are after him.
Listen, he's in bad shape, Jeremy, so if you find her, get her somewhere safe, ok?
I'm on my way.
If Damon is off the rails, there is nothing you can do to stop him.
Let us take care of it.
You keep doing this.
You left me behind before, and guess what.
Jenna still died.
Now I'm going to find my sister.
You go ahead and you try to stop me.
I heard about this one vampire, crazy bloke, always on and off the wagon for decades.
When he was off, he was magnificent.
1917, he went into Monterey and wiped out an entire migrant village...
A true ripper.
Sound familiar?
I haven't been that way in a very long time.
Well, that's the vampire I can make a deal with.
That is the kind of talent that I can use when I leave this town.
Katerina, come here.
Aah!
Aah!
No.
No...
No.
No.
No.
You want your cure?
There it is.
Your blood is the cure.
Gotta love mother nature.
Now...
Let's talk, you and I.
Katherine?
Damon.
Where's Elena?
I need to see Elena now.
Ok.
Let's get you out of here first, all right?
Where's Damon?
What did you do to him?
Why do you even care?
You know what they are, what they do.
Look, I understand why you hate them, but you're wrong.
They're murderers, Elena.
End of story.
Damon Salvatore was just spotted outside entering The Grill.
Wait.
You've gotta let me come with you.
He's sick.
He's... he's not himself.
Keep her here.
Hey, it's me.
I'm with Damon at The Grill.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I've got a gunshot victim at The Grill.
Get the paramedics here.
You're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be ok.
- Jeremy!
- Mom.
Mom, what did you do?
I was aiming for Damon.
He still has his ring.
She's human.
The ring won't work on him.
- Caroline...
- I got it.
Come on, Jeremy.
Just drink.
Go on, Jeremy.
Drink.
What are you doing?
I'm helping him.
Jeremy, drink.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Bonnie, what's going on?
Oh, my God.
I know what I need to do.
I need you to grab him.
T-take him with us.
No, no, no, no.
You can't move him.
This is a crime scene.
Mom, you let them go.
All right, come here, buddy.
I got you.
I got you.
There it is.
You want to save your brother?
How 'bout a decade-long bender?
And I have big plans for you when we leave this town.
I'm not like that anymore.
Well, that's too bad.
You would have made a hell of a wingman.
Wait.
Now that's more like it.
I want you to join me for a drink.
Finish it.
All of it.
You do everything I say, and I save your brother.
That's the deal.
Again.
Is this even possible?
There's a spell for it if they'll give me the power to use it.
Vitas phasmatis ex silento.
Revertas phasmatis ut victus.
Vitas phasmatis ex silento.
Revertas phasmatis ut victus.
No.
What?
What is it?
They're angry at me for coming back here.
They don't wanna help.
Well, they have to.
They said there'll be consequences.
Well, he's just a kid.
Tell 'em to shut up.
Vitas phasmatis ex silento.

Emily.
Emily!
I know you're there.
Please help me.
I love him.
No!
Oh, my God.
Bonnie.
Oh, my God, Jeremy.
Oh, my God.
What happened?
Doesn't matter.
You're ok.
You're ok.
Thank you.
Haven't left much for the Yankees to take, have we?
We'll have to make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition.
Elena.
Damon.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
We have to get you out of here.
We have to hide you where are we going?
Everywhere!
Wait for me.
I want to come with you.
Hey.
Hey.
Relax.
We need to get you out of here.
You're faster than I thought.
Why must you always run from me?
Because I know that you will chase.
Then let me chase you forever.
Feed me your blood.
I will not feed you, Damon.
If you want it, take it.
It is your choice to make.
I choose you, Katherine.
Look at me.
Hey.
It's Elena.
It's Elena.
Promise me you will not tell my brother.
I promise.
It will be our little secret.
No.
Damon.
No.
I have to...
If we are to be together forever.
Unh!
Damon, stop.
You're hurting me.
Damon, you don't have to do this.
Please stop.
You're hurting me!
Elena.
Damon.
Damon.
That was Bonnie.
Jeremy's alive.
I thought I killed him.
You did.
I don't understand.
I explained it to you once.
I...
I had to make you forget because I was so scared of what you might do.
But now...
I don't wanna lie.
I'm not gonna be afraid of you anymore.
I don't want you to be afraid of me anymore.
I'm still your little girl.
It's me.
It's me, mom.
Hey.
How you doing?
Trying to figure out what's wrong with me.
Feel different, weird.
Yeah, you were dead.
It'd be weird if you felt normal.
Bonnie, I, uh...
I don't know how to thank you.
You can thank me tomorrow.
And the day after that.
And the day after that.
Good night, Jeremy.
Good night.
Hey, bud.
I've gotta take off.
Need anything?
Uh, no, no.
I think I'm good.
You know, uh, on second thought,
I might just crash here.
Is that cool?
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
Whatever.
All right.
Alaric, um...
Thank you for everything.
Ah, you can thank me tomorrow...
And the day after that, the day after that.
Dude, come on!
I knew you were listening.
And the day after that.
Elena.
It's ok, Damon.
I'm right here.
Elena, get out of here.
I could hurt you.
No.
You won't.
I'm here until the very end.
I'm not leaving you.
Get out of here.
Aah!
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hang on.
Shh.
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's not ok.
It's not ok.
All those years, I've blamed Stefan.
No one forced me to love her.
It was my own choice.
Shh.
I made the wrong choice.
You tell Stefan I'm sorry.
Ok?
I will.
You're very cooperative.
It's almost as if you're enjoying it.
No more.
Not until you give me the cure.
Not until we make a deal.
It's your choice, Stefan.
You can either remain here living your life in Mystic Falls, or you can embrace what you truly are, leave town with me, and save your brother's life.
That's the spirit.
Sweetheart...
Take this over to Damon and come right back.
You want me to leave?
- No!
- Yes.
And if I were you...
I'd hurry.
She'll never take it to him.
She'll never take it to him.
This is even more pitiful than I thought.
There's still hope.
I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here.
I deserve this.
I deserve to die.
No.
You don't.
I do, Elena.
It's ok.
'Cause if I'd have chosen differently,
I wouldn't have met you.
I'm so sorry.
Done so many things to hurt you.
It's ok.
I forgive you.
I know you love Stefan.
And it will always be Stefan.
But I love you.
You should know that.
I do.
You should have met me in 1864.
You would have liked me.
I like you now.
Just the way you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well, it's me you should be thanking.
I mean, I'm the one who brought the cure.
I thought you were dead.
I was.
You got free.
Yep.
Finally.
And you still came here?
I owed you one.
Where's Stefan?
Are you sure you care?
Where is he?
He's paying for this.
He gave himself over to Klaus.
I wouldn't expect him anytime soon.
What do you mean, "he gave himself over"?
He just sacrificed everything to save his brother, including you.
It's a good thing you have Damon to keep you company.
Good-bye, Elena.
Oh.
It's ok to love them both.
I did.
I suppose, brother, you've been reunited with our family.
Put him with the others.
We're leaving town tonight.
So...
Did katerina make it in time?
You won't be seeing her again, you know.
Because she's on vervain?
I've been around a long time, Stefan.
I rarely get played for a fool.
Besides, she won't get far.
You'll help me see to that.
What is it you really want from me?
All will be explained in time.
Once we leave this tragic little town.
Then are we done here?
Can we go?
Not quite.
You see, I have a gift for you.
Come here, sweetheart.
Don't be afraid.
See, I wanna make sure you honor our deal...
That you'll be of use to me.
I could have compelled her to behave, but a real ripper enjoys the hunt.
Now we can go.
Alaric?
Alaric.
Jer.
Anna?
Vicky?
NARRATOR:
Previously on Vampire Diaries:
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelgänger.
The key to the curse.
Klaus is a vampire born from a werewolf bloodline.
The curse kept his werewolf from manifesting.
He'll be vulnerable during the transformation, when Bonnie comes in.
If she can deliver him to the brink of death, I'll finish the job.
I had a family.
Klaus hunted them down one by one.
He scattered them where their bodies could not be found.
I didn't bury them at sea.
Their bodies are safe.
If you kill me, you'll never find them.
No!
Who's gonna save your life while you're making decisions?
- I don't want to be saved.
- There is a way.
What are you?
Damon, no.
DAMON:
I fed her my blood.
She'll come back a vampire.
How could you?
She'll never forgive you.
- Tyler Lockwood bit me.
ELENA:
A werewolf bite can kill a vampire.
DAMON:
That'll get easier.
But you know that.
What do you want?
I wanna apologize.
- Damon...
DAMON:
Please.
Elena, feeding you my blood, I was wrong.
Yes, you were.
And I know I don't deserve your forgiveness but I need it.
And I need some time maybe a lot of time.
Sure.
Of course.
Take all the time you need.
[GRUNTS]
Get off of me.
You're not doing this.

You know what happened to Rose, Stefan.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]
You've reached somebody who's currently not operating.
I need your help.

- I don't blame you for Jenna.
- Oh, sure you do.
Let's not forget I turned your wife into a vampire.
- You must really hate me for that one.
- Okay, give me your glass.
Neither one of us is drunk enough for this conversation.
[ALARIC GRUNTING]
Kill me.
Please.
Screw you.
[DAMON GRUNTS]
No.
Elena?
Elena's not here, Damon.
Don't make a sound.
I need blood.
Please.
Blood.
[DAMON COUGHING]
FORBES:
Where's Damon?
Now's not a good time, sheriff.
Trust me.
MAN:
Sheriff, over here.
- I wouldn't go in there.
- I just wanna talk to him.
ALARIC:
I wouldn't go in there.
Liz.
[WHISPERING] All this waiting around for news is ruining Scarlett for me.
[CELL PHONE BUZZES]
- Alaric, hey.
- Tell me you're with Elena.
She went to see Damon, I thought that's where you were.
He escaped.
He's looking for her.
The cops are after him.
He's in bad shape.
If you find her get her somewhere safe, okay?
I'm on my way.
If Damon is off the rails, there is nothing you can do to stop him.
- Let us take care of it.
- You keep doing this.
You left me behind before and Jenna still died.
Now, I'm going to find my sister.
You go ahead and try to stop me.
I heard about this one vampire, crazy bloke always on and off the wagon for decades.
When he was off, he was magnificent.
1917, he went into Monterey and wiped out an entire migrant village.
A true ripper.
Sound familiar?
I haven't been that way in a very long time.
Well, that's the vampire I can make a deal with.
That is the kind of talent that I can use when I leave this town.
Katerina, come here.
No.
No.
No, no.
You want your cure?
There it is.
Your blood is the cure.
Gotta love Mother Nature.
Now let's talk, you and I.
[DAMON GRUNTING]
[DAMON COUGHING]
Katherine?
JEREMY:
Damon.
Where's Elena?
I need to see Elena now.
Hey, let's get you out of here first, all right?
Hey.
Where's Damon?
What have you done to him?
Why do you even care?
You know what they are, what they do.
I understand why you hate them, but you're wrong.
They're murderers, Elena.
End of story.
Damon Salvatore was spotted outside entering the Grill.
Wait.
You gotta let me come with you.
He's sick.
He's...
He's not himself.
FORBES:
Keep her here.
[CELL PHONE DIALING]
JEREMY:
Hey, it's me.
I'm with Damon at the Grill.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
I've got a gunshot victim at the Grill.
Get paramedics.
You're gonna be fine.
- Jeremy.
- It's gonna be okay.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What did you do?
I was aiming for Damon.
- He still has his ring.
- She's human.
The ring won't work.
- Caroline...
CAROLINE:
I got it.
Come on, Jeremy.
Just drink.
Jeremy, drink.
- What are you doing?
- Helping him.
- Jeremy, drink.
- Please.
Please.
Bonnie, what's going on?
Oh, my God.
I know what I need to do.
I need you to grab him.
- Take him with us.
- No, no, no, you can't move him.
- This is a crime scene.
- Mom, let them go.
[POLICE SIRENS BLARING]
Okay.
All right.
Come here, buddy.
I got you.
I got you.
[GRUNTS]
There it is.
You wanna save your brother?
How about a decade-long bender?
You know I have big plans for you when we leave this town.
I'm not like that anymore.
Well, that's too bad.
You would have made a hell of a wingman.
Wait.
Now, that's more like it.
I want you to join me for a drink.
Finish it.
All of it.
You do everything I say and I save your brother.
That's the deal.
Again.
Is this even possible?
There's a spell for it if they'll give me the power to use it.
[CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
- No.
- What?
What is it?
They're angry at me for coming back here.
[VOICES WHISPERING]
They don't wanna help.

Well, he's just a kid.

I wanna come with you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Relax.
- We need to get you out of here.
[GRUNTS]
- You're faster than I thought.
- Why must you always run?
Because I know you will chase.
Then let me chase you forever.
Will you feed me your blood?
I will not feed you, Damon.
If you want it, take it.
It is your choice to make.
I choose you, Katherine.
Look at me.
Hey.
It's Elena.
It's Elena.
- Promise me you will not tell my brother.
- I promise.
It will be our little secret.
No.
Damon.
No.
I have to, if we are to be together forever.
[ELENA GROANS]
Damon, stop.
You're hurting me.
Damon, you don't have to do this.
Please stop.
You're hurting me.
Elena.
ELENA:
Damon.
Damon.
CAROLINE:
That was Bonnie.
Jeremy's alive.
[SIGHS]
I thought I killed him.
You did.
I don't understand.
I explained it to you once.
But I had to make you forget because I was so scared of what you might do.
But now I don't wanna lie.
I'm not gonna be afraid of you anymore.
And I don't want you to be afraid of me anymore.
[SNIFFLES]
I'm still your little girl.
It's me.
It's me.
Mom?
Hey.
What are you doing?
Trying to figure out what's wrong with me.
I feel different, weird.
You were dead.
It would be weird if you felt normal.
Bonnie, I...
I don't know how to thank you.
You can thank me tomorrow.
And the day after that.
And the day after that.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Good night, Jeremy.
- Good night.
ALARIC:
Hey, bud.
I was gonna take off.
You need anything?
Uh...
No, no.
I think I'm good.
You know, uh on second thought, I might crash here.
That cool?
Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.
All right.
Alaric, um...
Thank you for everything.
Oh, you can thank me tomorrow.
And the day after that.
- And the day after that.
- Dude, I knew you were listening.
- And the day after that.
- Ha-ha-ha.
DAMON:
Elena.
It's okay, Damon.
I'm right here.
Elena, get out of here.
I could hurt you.
No.
You won't.
I'm here until the very end.
I'm not leaving you.
Get out of here.
[GROANING]
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.
It's not okay.
All those years, I've blamed Stefan.
No one forced me to love her.
It was my own choice.
Shh.
- I made the wrong choice.
ELENA:
Hey.
You tell Stefan I'm sorry.
Okay?
I will.
[GROWLING]
You're very cooperative.
It's almost as if you're enjoying it.
No more.
Not until you give me the cure.
Not until we make a deal.
It's your choice, Stefan.
You can either remain here living your life in Mystic Falls or you can embrace what you truly are.
Leave town with me and save your brother's life.
That's the spirit.
Sweetheart take this over to Damon and come right back.
- You want me to leave?
- No.
Yes.
And if I were you I'd hurry.
She'll never take it to him.
This is even more pitiful than I thought.
There's still hope.
I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here.
I deserve this.
I deserve to die.
No.
- You don't.
- I do, Elena.
It's okay.
Because if I'd have chosen differently, I wouldn't have met you.
I'm so sorry.
I've done so many things to hurt you.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
I know you love Stefan.
And it will always be Stefan.
But I love you.
You should know that.
I do.
You should have met me in 1864.
You would have liked me.
I like you now.
Just the way you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
KATHERINE:
Well, it's me you should be thanking.
I mean, I'm the one who brought the cure.
- I thought you were dead.
- I was.
You got free.
Yep.
Finally.
And you still came here?
I owed you one.
Where's Stefan?
- Are you sure you care?
- Where is he?
He's paying for this.
He gave himself over to Klaus.
- I wouldn't expect him anytime soon.
- What do you mean "gave himself over"?
He just sacrificed everything to save his brother, including you.
It's a good thing you have Damon to keep you company.
Goodbye, Elena.
Oh...
It's okay to love them both.
I did.
I suppose, brother you've been reunited with our family.
Put him with the others.
We're leaving town tonight.
[CELL PHONE BUZZES]
KLAUS:
So did Katerina make it in time?
- You won't be seeing her again.
- Because she's on vervain?
I've been around a long time, Stefan.
I rarely get played for a fool.
Besides, she won't get far.
You'll help me see to that.
What is it you really want from me?
All will be explained in time.
Once we leave this tragic little town.
Then are we done here?
- Can we go?
- Not quite.
You see, I have a gift for you.
Come here, sweetheart.
Don't be afraid.
See, I wanna make sure you honor our deal that you'll be of use to me.
I could have compelled her to behave, but a real ripper enjoys the hunt.
[WOMAN SCREAMING]
[WOMAN GROANING]
Now we can go.
Alaric?
Alaric.
Jer.
Anna?

NARRATOR:
Previously on Vampire Diaries:
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
The key to the curse.
Klaus is a vampire born from a werewolf bloodline.
The curse kept his werewolf from manifesting.
He'll be vulnerable during the transformation, when Bonnie comes in.
If she can deliver him to the brink of death, I'll finish the job.
I had a family.
Klaus hunted them down one by one.
He scattered them where their bodies could not be found.
I didn't bury them at sea.
Their bodies are safe.
If you kill me, you'll never find them.
No!
Who's gonna save your life while you're making decisions?
- I don't want to be saved.
- There is a way.
What are you...?
Damon, no.
DAMON:
I fed her my blood.
She'll come back a vampire.
How could you?
She'll never forgive you.
- Tyler Lockwood bit me.
ELENA:
A werewolf bite can kill a vampire.
DAMON:
That'll get easier.
But you know that.
What do you want?
I wanna apologize.
- Damon...
DAMON:
Please.
Elena, feeding you my blood, I was wrong.
Yes, you were.
And I know I don't deserve your forgiveness but I need it.
And I need some time maybe a lot of time.
Sure.
Of course.
Take all the time you need.
[GRUNTS]
Get off of me.
You're not doing this.
Just did.
You know what happened to Rose, Stefan.
I don't care.
[GRUNTS]
You're not dying today.
What's the plan, Superman?
- I'm gonna find a way out of this.
- Oh, right.
A miracle cure.
Good luck with that one.
I got Bonnie looking for something, anything.
Always the hero, Stefan.
Just tell me goodbye, get it over with.
[COUGHING]
Lie still.
Conserve your strength.
[GROANS]
ELIJAH:
You've been busy.
That was amazing.
How long has it been?
Almost two days.
Full moon came and went.
You remained a wolf.
I can change at will then.
That's good to know.
I remember every single kill.
Yes, I've been cleaning up your mess.
Just like old times, brother.
Well, you've had your fun.
I believe we have a bargain.
KLAUS:
That's right.
Now, what was it again?
Oh, yeah, wait.
I remember.
That's it.
You wish to be reunited with our family.
You gave me your word, Niklaus.
What kind of brother would break his bond?
Even though you did try to kill me.
I could have.
But I didn't.
Now no one can, not even you.
Relax, Elijah.
All is forgiven.
Where are they?
You need to lighten up.
I'll bring you to them soon enough.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
You've reached somebody who's currently not operating.
I need your help.
You have me confused with somebody else.
I'm not allowed to help just idly sit by while my girlfriend gets sacrificed on an altar of blood.
Damors dying.
- What?
STEFAN:
Tyler Lockwood bit him.
We don't have much time.
What do you need?
You brought me to see a girl movie.
We had to get out of the house, Jer.
This is our three-hour distraction from reality.
Is that what we're doing?
Pretending our lives aren't screwed?
We need to do this, okay?
Breathe, eat, sleep, wake up and do it all over again until one day, it's just not as hard anymore.
Hey.
There you guys are.
- Who's hungry?
- Are we really doing this?
Yes, we are really doing this.
Yeah, we're going to take a page from Scarlett.
We made it through the war.
I know you guys went through hell, and my mom knows I am a vampire so basically, it's like Atlanta has burned.
And yet, in spite of everything, we persevere.
[SIGHS]
All right.
What are we eating?
Something good.
[SIGHS]
I'm not sure this is gonna work.
You've done a séance before, right?
Contacted Emily Bennett.
Maybe one of the witches know how to help Damon.
Let's just hope they want to.
[CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[VOICES WHISPERING]
Bonnie?
Bonnie?
Emily.
Why have you come here, Stefan?
I need your help.
I need to know if there's a spell that can heal a werewolf bite.
No.
Nature ensures a balance to everything.
Is that true?
Or are you just saying no because it's Damon?
Perhaps it is his time to die.
No.
That's not balance that's punishment.
I will not give you what you want.
So you're saying that there's an answer to give?
Please.
If you know something, just tell me.
Help me save my brother.
[SCREAMS]
Bonnie.
They don't want us here.
They think I'm abusing their power.
They know something.
There's an answer.
- They just don't wanna tell me.
- Yeah.
I heard them say a name.
What was it?
Klaus.
Carol, hi.
How you feeling?
Better, thank goodness.
It was a terrible fall.
Shouldrt you be resting?
I've been resting.
Now I'm ready to work.
Update me on where we are with the vampire situation.
Well, there's been some developments, but I'm handling it.
Are you?
I left you in charge of this towrs safety and I'm not seeing any results.
I said, I'm handling it.
Then see that you do, sheriff because if you can't, I'll find someone who will.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Look who couldn't resist an epic romance.
Will you come take a walk with me?
ELENA:
You're breaking the rules, you know.
Movie night's supposed to be a distraction.
Tomorrow we can return to our regularly-scheduled drama.
I know, I wish this could wait, but it can't.
Listen, um the other night when Damon was helping Tyler, something happened.
Tyler was starting to transform and Damon was bitten.
What?
Is it...?
Is he gonna...?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
He came to the house this morning and tried to apologize.
I practically slammed the door in his face.
He told me not to tell you, but I figured if you wanted to talk to him...
I wouldn't wait.
- Stefan...
- It's not over.
There might be a cure.
- But I have to find Klaus to get it.
- No, he's gonna kill you.
No, he had the chance to kill me, but he didn't.
Whatever Damors done, whatever's led him here I'm the one that made him become a vampire in the first place.
So if there's a chance for a cure, I owe it to him to find it.
Go talk to him.
Just tell him that there's still hope.
[DAMON GRUNTS]
Mr. Salvatore, spying on a lady is a sign of very poor manners.
My apologies, Miss Katherine.
But since you are here my corset strings seem to be knotted.
I wonder if you can undo them.
Of course.
Will you miss me while off defending the South?
- I shall.
- Then I hope you will hurry back.
I fear I will be lonely with you away.
I would think Stefan should be company enough.
Is it so wrong for me to want you both?
ELENA:
Damon.
- Elena?
- Don't you see?
She was toying with you.
All you had to do was say no, walk away.
You had a choice.
Promise me that you will return quickly.
I promise.
- Hello, Katherine.
- Two days, I've been waiting.
I'm supposed to be free of Klaus' compulsion by now.
- He's supposed to be dead.
- We ran into complications.
- Complications?
- Doesrt really matter.
I just need to find him.
Do you have any idea where he might be?
Klaus, you're back.
Look who decided to come for a visit.
You just keep popping up, don't you?
I need your help.
For my brother.
Whatever it is, is gonna have to wait.
You see, I have an obligation to my brother that requires my immediate attention.
You understand how important family is or you wouldn't be here.
My brother gave me his word that he would reunite me with my own.
KLAUS:
And so I shall.
[SCREAMS]
Shh.
Now, what am I gonna do with you?
[STEFAN GROANING]
Do you feel that?
It's scraping against your heart.
The slightest little movement and you're dead.
[GRUNTING]
He's just trying to help his brother.
STEFAN:
The witches said you had a cure.
Make me a deal.
Just give me the cure and I'll do whatever you want.
[STEFAN GRUNTING]
KLAUS:
Trouble is I don't know if you'd be any good to me the way you are now.
You're just shy of useless.
- Well, that looks bad.
- It feels worse.
My subconscious is haunting me, Ric.
Please tell me you have something for that.
Heh.
Double shot.
That's good.
Oh, good.
[GRUNTS]
So my brother sent you for suicide watch?
He's just trying to help.
He's doing what he always does trying to right the wrongs of the past.
Ugh.
[COUGHING]
You should want me dead.
I'm the reason Jenna got killed.
- I don't blame you for Jenna.
- Oh, sure you do.
Let's not forget I turned your wife into a vampire.
- You must really hate me for that one.
- Okay, give me your glass.

Ha-ha-ha.
- Good night, Jeremy.
- Good night.
ALARIC:
Hey, bud.
I was gonna take off.
You need anything?
Uh...
No, no.
I think I'm good.
You know, uh on second thought, I might crash here.
That cool?
Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.
All right.
Alaric, um...
Thank you for everything.
Oh, you can thank me tomorrow.
And the day after that.
- And the day after that.
- Dude, I knew you were listening.
- And the day after that.
- Ha-ha-ha.
DAMON:
Elena.
It's okay, Damon.
I'm right here.
Elena, get out of here.
I could hurt you.
No.
You won't.
I'm here until the very end.
I'm not leaving you.
Get out of here.
[GROANING]
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.
It's not okay.
All those years, I've blamed Stefan.
No one forced me to love her.
It was my own choice.
Shh.
- I made the wrong choice.
ELENA:
Hey.
You tell Stefan I'm sorry.
Okay?
I will.
[GROWLING]
You're very cooperative.
It's almost as if you're enjoying it.
No more.
Not until you give me the cure.
Not until we make a deal.
It's your choice, Stefan.
You can either remain here living your life in Mystic Falls or you can embrace what you truly are.
Leave town with me and save your brother's life.
That's the spirit.
Sweetheart take this over to Damon and come right back.
- You want me to leave?
- No.
Yes.
And if I were you I'd hurry.
She'll never take it to him.
She'll never take it to him.
This is even more pitiful than I thought.
There's still hope.
I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here.
I deserve this.
I deserve to die.
No.
- You don't.
- I do, Elena.
It's okay.
Because if I'd have chosen differently, I wouldn't have met you.
I'm so sorry.
I've done so many things to hurt you.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
I know you love Stefan.
And it will always be Stefan.
But I love you.
You should know that.
I do.
You should have met me in 1864.
You would have liked me.
I like you now.
Just the way you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
KATHERINE:
Well, it's me you should be thanking.
I mean, I'm the one who brought the cure.
- I thought you were dead.
- I was.
You got free.
Yep.
Finally.
And you still came here?
I owed you one.
Where's Stefan?
- Are you sure you care?
- Where is he?
He's paying for this.
He gave himself over to Klaus.
- I wouldn't expect him anytime soon.
- What do you mean "gave himself over"?
He just sacrificed everything to save his brother, including you.
It's a good thing you have Damon to keep you company.
Goodbye, Elena.
Oh...
It's okay to love them both.
I did.
I suppose, brother you've been reunited with our family.
Put him with the others.
We're leaving town tonight.
[CELL PHONE BUZZES]
KLAUS:
So did Katerina make it in time?
- You won't be seeing her again.
- Because she's on vervain?
I've been around a long time, Stefan.
I rarely get played for a fool.
Besides, she won't get far.
You'll help me see to that.
What is it you really want from me?
All will be explained in time.
Once we leave this tragic little town.
Then are we done here?
- Can we go?
- Not quite.
You see, I have a gift for you.
Come here, sweetheart.
Don't be afraid.
See, I wanna make sure you honor our deal that you'll be of use to me.
I could have compelled her to behave, but a real ripper enjoys the hunt.
[WOMAN SCREAMING]
[WOMAN GROANING]
Now we can go.
Alaric?
Alaric.
Jer.
Anna?
Vicki?

Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...
You must be Elena.
How do we look exactly alike?
You're a Petrova doppelganger.
You're the key to breaking the curse.
Klaus is a vampire born from a werewolf bloodline.
The curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting.
He'll be vulnerable during the transformation.
That's when Bonnie comes in.
If she can deliver him to the brink of death,
I'll finish the job myself.
I had a family.
Klaus hunted them down one by one.
He scattered them across the seas, where their bodies could not be found.
I didn't bury them at sea.
Their bodies are safe.
If you kill me, you'll never find them.
No!
Who's going to save your life while you're out making decisions?
I don't want to be saved.
There is another way.
What are you...
Damon, no.
I fed her my blood.
She'll come back a vampire.
How could you take that choice away from her?
She'll never forgive you.
Tyler Lockwood bit me.
A werewolf bite can kill a vampire.
That'll get easier.
But you knew that.
What do you want?
I want to apologize.
Damon.
Please.
Elena, feeding you my blood, I was wrong.
Yes, you were.
And I know I don't deserve your forgiveness, but...
I need it.
And I need some time, maybe a lot of time.
True.
Of course.
Take all the time you need.
== resync by jacobian @ hdbits.org for 720p Web-DL ==
Get off of me.
You're not doing this.
Just did.
You know what happened to Rose, Stefan.
I don't care.
You're not dying today.
What's the plan, Superman?
I'm gonna find a way out of this.
Oh, right.
A miracle cure.
Good luck with that one.
I got Bonnie looking for something, anything.
Always the hero, Stefan.
Just tell me good-bye, get it over with.
Lie still.
Conserve your strength.
You've been busy.
That was amazing.
How long has it been?
Almost 2 days.
Full moon came and went.
You remained a wolf.
I can change at will, then.
It's good to know.
I remember every single kill.
Yes, I've been cleaning up your little mess along the way.
Just like old times, brother.
You've had your fun.
I believe we have a bargain.
That's right.
Now, what was it again?
Oh, yeah.
Wait.
I remember.
That's it.
You wish to be reunited with our family.
You gave me your word, Niklaus.
What kind of brother would break his bond?
Even though you did try to kill me.
I could have.
But I didn't.
And now no one can, not even you.
Relax, Elijah.
All is forgiven.
Where are they?
You need to lighten up.
I'll bring you to them soon enough.
Sorry, you've reached somebody who's currently not operating.
I need your help.
Well, you must have me confused with somebody else.
You see, I'm not allowed to help, just idly sit by while my girlfriend gets sacrificed on an altar of blood.
Damon's dying.
- What?
- Tyler Lockwood bit him.
We don't have much time.
What do you need?
You brought me to see a girl movie.
We had to get out of the house, Jer.
This is our 3-hour distraction from reality.
Is that what we're doing?
Pretending like our lives aren't screwed?
We need to do this, ok?
Breathe, eat, sleep, wake up, and do it all over again until one day, it's just not as hard anymore.
Hey!
There you guys are.
Who's hungry?
Are we really doing this?
Yes, we are really doing this.
We are going to take a page from Scarlett.
We made it through the war.
I know you guys went through hell, and my mom knows I am a vampire, so basically it's like Atlanta has burned.
And yet, in spite of everything, we persevere.
All right.
What are we eating?
Something good.
I'm not sure this is going to work.
You've done a séance before, right?
Contacted Emily Bennett.
Maybe one of the witches might know how to help Damon.
Let's just hope they want to.
Phesmatos manex un domo hax, fero adiuvex.
Phesmatos manex.
Phesmatos manex un domo hax, fero adiuvex.
Bonnie.
Bonnie.
Emily.
Why have you come here, Stefan?
I need your help.
I need to know if there's a spell that can heal a werewolf bite.
No.
Nature ensures a balance to everything.
Is that true... or are you just saying no because it's Damon?
Perhaps it is his time to die.
No.
That's not balance.
That's punishment.
I will not give you what you want.
So you're saying that there's an answer to give?
Please, if you know something, just tell me.
Help me save my brother.
Aah!
Ohh.
Bonnie.
They don't want us here.
They think I'm abusing their power.
They know something.
There's an answer.
They just don't want to tell me.
Yeah.
I heard them say a name.
What was it?
Klaus.
Carol.
Hi.
How you feeling?
Better, thank goodness.
That was a terrible fall.
Shouldn't you be home resting?
I've been resting, and now I'm ready to get back to work.
I need you to update me on where we are with the vampire situation.
Well, there have been some developments, but I'm handling it.
Are you?
Because I left you in charge of this town's safety, and lately I'm not seeing any results.
I said I'm handling it.
Then see that you do, Sheriff, because if you can't, I'll find someone who will.
Hey.
Hey.
Look who couldn't resist an epic romance.
Will you come take a walk with me?
You're breaking the rules, you know.
Movie night's supposed to be a distraction.
Tomorrow we can return to our regularly scheduled drama.
I know.
I wish this could wait, but it can't.
Listen, um, the other night when Damon was helping Tyler, something happened.
Tyler was starting to transform, and Damon was bitten.
What?
Is it... is he gonna...
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
And he came to the house this morning and... and tried to apologize.
I practically slammed the door in his face.
He told me not to tell you, but I figured if you wanted to talk to him, I...
I wouldn't wait.
Stefan... it's not over.
There might be a cure, but I have to find Klaus to get it.
No.
He's gonna kill you.
No, he had the chance to kill me, but he didn't.
Whatever Damon's done, whatever has led him here,
I'm the one that made him become a vampire in the first place, so if there's a chance for a cure,
I owe it to him to find it.
Go talk to him.
Just tell him that there's still hope.
Mr. Salvatore, spying on a lady is a sign of very poor manners.
My apologies, miss Katherine.
But since you are here, my corset strings seem to be knotted.
I wonder if you can undo them.
Of course.
Will you miss me while off defending the South?
I shall.
Then I hope you will hurry back.
I fear I will be lonely with you away.
I would think Stefan should be company enough.
Is it so wrong for me to want you both?
Damon.
Elena?
Don't you see?
She was toying with you.
All you had to do was say no, walk away.
You had a choice.
Promise me that you will return quickly.
I promise.
Hello, Katherine.
Two days, I've been waiting.
I'm supposed to be free of Klaus' compulsion by now.
He's supposed to be dead.
We ran into complications.
Complications?
Doesn't really matter.
I just need to find him.
Do you have any idea where he might be?
Shh.
Klaus, you're back.
Look who decided to come for a visit.
You just keep popping up, don't you?
I need your help...
For my brother.
Well, whatever it is, he's gonna have to wait a tick.
You see, I have an obligation to my brother that requires my immediate attention.
You understand how important family is, or you wouldn't be here.
My brother gave me his word that he would reunite me with my own.
And so I shall.
Raah!
Shh.
Now, what am I gonna do with you?
Do you feel that?
It's scraping against your heart.
The slightest little movement, and you're dead.
He's just trying to help his brother.
The witches said you had a cure.
Make me a deal.
Just give me the cure, and I'll do whatever you want.
Trouble is I don't know if you'd be any good to me the way you are now.
You are just shy of useless.
Well, that looks bad.
It feels worse.
My subconscious is haunting me, Rick.
Please tell me you have something for that.
Heh.
Double shot.
That's good.
Oh, good.
So my brother sent you for suicide watch?
He's just trying to help.
He's doing what he always does, trying to right the wrongs of the past.
Aah!
You should want me dead.
I'm the reason Jenna got killed.
I don't blame you for Jenna.
Oh, sure you do.
Let's not forget I turned your wife into a vampire.
You must really hate me for that one.
Ok, give me your glass.
Neither one of us is drunk enough for this conversation.
Kill me.
Please.
Screw you.
Aah.
No.
Elena?
Elena's not here, Damon.
Don't make a sound.
I need blood.
I need blood.
Where's Damon?
You know, now's not a good time, Sheriff.
Trust me.
Sheriff, over here.
I wouldn't go in there.
I just wanna talk to him.
I wouldn't go in there.
Liz.
All this waiting around for news is ruining Scarlett for me.
Alaric.
Hey.
Tell me you're with Elena.
She went to go see Damon.
I thought that's where you were.
No, he just escaped.
I think he's looking for her, and the cops are after him.
Listen, he's in bad shape, Jeremy, so if you find her, get her somewhere safe, ok?
I'm on my way.
If Damon is off the rails, there is nothing you can do to stop him.
Let us take care of it.
You keep doing this.
You left me behind before, and guess what.
Jenna still died.
Now I'm going to find my sister.
You go ahead and you try to stop me.
I heard about this one vampire, crazy bloke, always on and off the wagon for decades.
When he was off, he was magnificent.
1917, he went into Monterey and wiped out an entire migrant village...
A true ripper.
Sound familiar?
I haven't been that way in a very long time.
Well, that's the vampire I can make a deal with.
That is the kind of talent that I can use when I leave this town.
Katerina, come here.
Aah!
Aah!
No.
No...
No.
No.
No.
You want your cure?
There it is.
Your blood is the cure.
Gotta love mother nature.
Now...
Let's talk, you and I.
Katherine?
Damon.
Where's Elena?
I need to see Elena now.
Ok.
Let's get you out of here first, all right?
Where's Damon?
What did you do to him?
Why do you even care?
You know what they are, what they do.
Look, I understand why you hate them, but you're wrong.
They're murderers, Elena.
End of story.
Damon Salvatore was just spotted outside entering The Grill.
Wait.
You've gotta let me come with you.
He's sick.
He's... he's not himself.
Keep her here.
Hey, it's me.
I'm with Damon at The Grill.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I've got a gunshot victim at The Grill.
Get the paramedics here.
You're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be ok.
- Jeremy!
- Mom.
Mom, what did you do?
I was aiming for Damon.
He still has his ring.
She's human.
The ring won't work on him.
- Caroline...
- I got it.
Come on, Jeremy.
Just drink.
Go on, Jeremy.
Drink.
What are you doing?
I'm helping him.
Jeremy, drink.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Bonnie, what's going on?
Oh, my God.
I know what I need to do.
I need you to grab him.
T-take him with us.
No, no, no, no.
You can't move him.
This is a crime scene.
Mom, you let them go.
All right, come here, buddy.
I got you.
I got you.
There it is.
You want to save your brother?
How 'bout a decade-long bender?
And I have big plans for you when we leave this town.
I'm not like that anymore.
Well, that's too bad.
You would have made a hell of a wingman.
Wait.
Now that's more like it.
I want you to join me for a drink.
Finish it.
All of it.
You do everything I say, and I save your brother.
That's the deal.
Again.
Is this even possible?
There's a spell for it if they'll give me the power to use it.
Vitas phasmatis ex silento.
Revertas phasmatis ut victus.
Vitas phasmatis ex silento.
Revertas phasmatis ut victus.
No.
What?
What is it?
They're angry at me for coming back here.
They don't wanna help.
Well, they have to.
They said there'll be consequences.
Well, he's just a kid.
Tell 'em to shut up.

Emily.
Emily!
I know you're there.
Please help me.
I love him.
No!
Oh, my God.
Bonnie.
Oh, my God, Jeremy.
Oh, my God.
What happened?
Doesn't matter.
You're ok.
You're ok.
Thank you.
Haven't left much for the Yankees to take, have we?
We'll have to make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition.
Elena.
Damon.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
We have to get you out of here.
We have to hide you where are we going?
Everywhere!
Wait for me.
I want to come with you.
Hey.
Hey.
Relax.
We need to get you out of here.
You're faster than I thought.
Why must you always run from me?
Because I know that you will chase.
Then let me chase you forever.
Feed me your blood.
I will not feed you, Damon.
If you want it, take it.
It is your choice to make.
I choose you, Katherine.
Look at me.
Hey.
It's Elena.
It's Elena.
Promise me you will not tell my brother.
I promise.
It will be our little secret.
No.
Damon.
No.
I have to...
If we are to be together forever.
Unh!
Damon, stop.
You're hurting me.
Damon, you don't have to do this.
Please stop.
You're hurting me!
Elena.
Damon.
Damon.
That was Bonnie.
Jeremy's alive.
I thought I killed him.
You did.
I don't understand.
I explained it to you once.
I...
I had to make you forget because I was so scared of what you might do.
But now...
I don't wanna lie.
I'm not gonna be afraid of you anymore.
I don't want you to be afraid of me anymore.
I'm still your little girl.
It's me.
It's me, mom.
Hey.
How you doing?
Trying to figure out what's wrong with me.
Feel different, weird.
Yeah, you were dead.
It'd be weird if you felt normal.
Bonnie, I, uh...
I don't know how to thank you.
You can thank me tomorrow.
And the day after that.
And the day after that.
Good night, Jeremy.
Good night.
Hey, bud.
I've gotta take off.
Need anything?
Uh, no, no.
I think I'm good.
You know, uh, on second thought,
I might just crash here.
Is that cool?
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
Whatever.
All right.
Alaric, um...
Thank you for everything.
Ah, you can thank me tomorrow...
And the day after that, the day after that.
Dude, come on!
I knew you were listening.
And the day after that.
Elena.
It's ok, Damon.
I'm right here.
Elena, get out of here.
I could hurt you.
No.
You won't.
I'm here until the very end.
I'm not leaving you.
Get out of here.
Aah!
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hang on.
Shh.
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's not ok.
It's not ok.
All those years, I've blamed Stefan.
No one forced me to love her.
It was my own choice.
Shh.
I made the wrong choice.
You tell Stefan I'm sorry.
Ok?
I will.
You're very cooperative.
It's almost as if you're enjoying it.
No more.
Not until you give me the cure.
Not until we make a deal.
It's your choice, Stefan.
You can either remain here living your life in Mystic Falls, or you can embrace what you truly are, leave town with me, and save your brother's life.
That's the spirit.
Sweetheart...
Take this over to Damon and come right back.
You want me to leave?
- No!
- Yes.
And if I were you...
I'd hurry.
She'll never take it to him.
She'll never take it to him.
This is even more pitiful than I thought.
There's still hope.
I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here.
I deserve this.
I deserve to die.
No.
You don't.
I do, Elena.
It's ok.
'Cause if I'd have chosen differently,
I wouldn't have met you.
I'm so sorry.
Done so many things to hurt you.
It's ok.
I forgive you.
I know you love Stefan.
And it will always be Stefan.
But I love you.
You should know that.
I do.
You should have met me in 1864.

Are you sure you care?
Where is he?
He's paying for this.
He gave himself over to Klaus.
I wouldn't expect him anytime soon.
What do you mean, "he gave himself over"?
He just sacrificed everything to save his brother, including you.
It's a good thing you have Damon to keep you company.
Good-bye, Elena.
Oh.
It's ok to love them both.
I did.
I suppose, brother, you've been reunited with our family.
Put him with the others.
We're leaving town tonight.
So...
Did katerina make it in time?
You won't be seeing her again, you know.

Are we really doing this?
Yes, we are really doing this.
We are going to take a page from Scarlett.
We made it through the war.
I know you guys went through hell, and my mom knows I am a vampire, so basically it's like Atlanta has burned.
And yet, in spite of everything, we persevere.
All right.
What are we eating?
Something good.
I'm not sure this is going to work.
You've done a séance before, right?
Contacted Emily Bennett.
Maybe one of the witches might know how to help Damon.
Let's just hope they want to.
Phesmatos manex un domo hax, fero adiuvex.
Phesmatos manex.
Phesmatos manex un domo hax, fero adiuvex.
Bonnie.
Bonnie.
Emily.
Why have you come here, Stefan?
I need your help.
I need to know if there's a spell that can heal a werewolf bite.
No.
Nature ensures a balance to everything.
Is that true... or are you just saying no because it's Damon?
Perhaps it is his time to die.
No.
That's not balance.
That's punishment.
I will not give you what you want.
So you're saying that there's an answer to give?
Please, if you know something, just tell me.
Help me save my brother.
Aah!
Ohh.
Bonnie.
They don't want us here.
They think I'm abusing their power.
They know something.
There's an answer.
They just don't want to tell me.
Yeah.
I heard them say a name.
What was it?
Klaus.
Carol.
Hi.
How you feeling?
Better, thank goodness.
That was a terrible fall.
Shouldn't you be home resting?
I've been resting, and now I'm ready to get back to work.
I need you to update me on where we are with the vampire situation.
Well, there have been some developments, but I'm handling it.
Are you?
Because I left you in charge of this town's safety, and lately I'm not seeing any results.
I said I'm handling it.
Then see that you do, Sheriff, because if you can't, I'll find someone who will.
Hey.
Hey.
Look who couldn't resist an epic romance.
Will you come take a walk with me?
You're breaking the rules, you know.
Movie night's supposed to be a distraction.
Tomorrow we can return to our regularly scheduled drama.
I know.
I wish this could wait, but it can't.
Listen, um, the other night when Damon was helping Tyler, something happened.
Tyler was starting to transform, and Damon was bitten.
What?
Is it... is he gonna...
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
And he came to the house this morning and... and tried to apologize.
I practically slammed the door in his face.
He told me not to tell you, but I figured if you wanted to talk to him, I...
I wouldn't wait.
Stefan... it's not over.
There might be a cure, but I have to find Klaus to get it.
No.
He's gonna kill you.
No, he had the chance to kill me, but he didn't.
Whatever Damon's done, whatever has led him here,
I'm the one that made him become a vampire in the first place, so if there's a chance for a cure,
I owe it to him to find it.
Go talk to him.
Just tell him that there's still hope.
Mr. Salvatore, spying on a lady is a sign of very poor manners.
My apologies, miss Katherine.
But since you are here, my corset strings seem to be knotted.
I wonder if you can undo them.
Of course.
Will you miss me while off defending the South?
I shall.
Then I hope you will hurry back.
I fear I will be lonely with you away.
I would think Stefan should be company enough.
Is it so wrong for me to want you both?
Damon.
Elena?
Don't you see?
She was toying with you.
All you had to do was say no, walk away.
You had a choice.
Promise me that you will return quickly.
I promise.
Hello, Katherine.
Two days, I've been waiting.
I'm supposed to be free of Klaus' compulsion by now.
He's supposed to be dead.
We ran into complications.
Complications?
Doesn't really matter.
I just need to find him.
Do you have any idea where he might be?
Shh.
Klaus, you're back.
Look who decided to come for a visit.
You just keep popping up, don't you?
I need your help...
For my brother.
Well, whatever it is, he's gonna have to wait a tick.
You see, I have an obligation to my brother that requires my immediate attention.
You understand how important family is, or you wouldn't be here.
My brother gave me his word that he would reunite me with my own.
And so I shall.
Raah!
Shh.
Now, what am I gonna do with you?
Do you feel that?
It's scraping against your heart.
The slightest little movement, and you're dead.
He's just trying to help his brother.
The witches said you had a cure.
Make me a deal.
Just give me the cure, and I'll do whatever you want.
Trouble is I don't know if you'd be any good to me the way you are now.
You are just shy of useless.
Well, that looks bad.
It feels worse.
My subconscious is haunting me, Rick.
Please tell me you have something for that.
Heh.
Double shot.
That's good.
Oh, good.
So my brother sent you for suicide watch?
He's just trying to help.
He's doing what he always does, trying to right the wrongs of the past.
Aah!
You should want me dead.
I'm the reason Jenna got killed.
I don't blame you for Jenna.
Oh, sure you do.
Let's not forget I turned your wife into a vampire.
You must really hate me for that one.
Ok, give me your glass.
Neither one of us is drunk enough for this conversation.
Kill me.
Please.
Screw you.
Aah.
No.
Elena?
Elena's not here, Damon.
Don't make a sound.
I need blood.
I need blood.
Where's Damon?
You know, now's not a good time, Sheriff.
Trust me.
Sheriff, over here.
I wouldn't go in there.
I just wanna talk to him.
I wouldn't go in there.
Liz.
All this waiting around for news is ruining Scarlett for me.
Alaric.
Hey.
Tell me you're with Elena.
She went to go see Damon.
I thought that's where you were.
No, he just escaped.
I think he's looking for her, and the cops are after him.
Listen, he's in bad shape, Jeremy, so if you find her, get her somewhere safe, ok?
I'm on my way.
If Damon is off the rails, there is nothing you can do to stop him.
Let us take care of it.
You keep doing this.
You left me behind before, and guess what.
Jenna still died.
Now I'm going to find my sister.
You go ahead and you try to stop me.
I heard about this one vampire, crazy bloke, always on and off the wagon for decades.
When he was off, he was magnificent.
1917, he went into Monterey and wiped out an entire migrant village...
A true ripper.
Sound familiar?
I haven't been that way in a very long time.
Well, that's the vampire I can make a deal with.
That is the kind of talent that I can use when I leave this town.
Katerina, come here.
Aah!
Aah!
No.
No...
No.
No.
No.
You want your cure?
There it is.
Your blood is the cure.
Gotta love mother nature.
Now...
Let's talk, you and I.
Katherine?
Damon.
Where's Elena?
I need to see Elena now.
Ok.
Let's get you out of here first, all right?
Where's Damon?
What did you do to him?
Why do you even care?
You know what they are, what they do.
Look, I understand why you hate them, but you're wrong.
They're murderers, Elena.
End of story.
Damon Salvatore was just spotted outside entering The Grill.
Wait.
You've gotta let me come with you.
He's sick.
He's... he's not himself.
Keep her here.
Hey, it's me.
I'm with Damon at The Grill.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I've got a gunshot victim at The Grill.
Get the paramedics here.
You're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be ok.
- Jeremy!
- Mom.
Mom, what did you do?
I was aiming for Damon.
He still has his ring.
She's human.
The ring won't work on him.
- Caroline...
- I got it.
Come on, Jeremy.
Just drink.
Go on, Jeremy.
Drink.
What are you doing?
I'm helping him.
Jeremy, drink.
Please.
Please.
Please.
Bonnie, what's going on?
Oh, my God.
I know what I need to do.
I need you to grab him.
T-take him with us.
No, no, no, no.
You can't move him.
This is a crime scene.
Mom, you let them go.
All right, come here, buddy.
I got you.
I got you.
There it is.
You want to save your brother?
How 'bout a decade-long bender?
And I have big plans for you when we leave this town.
I'm not like that anymore.
Well, that's too bad.
You would have made a hell of a wingman.
Wait.
Now that's more like it.
I want you to join me for a drink.
Finish it.
All of it.
You do everything I say, and I save your brother.
That's the deal.
Again.
Is this even possible?
There's a spell for it if they'll give me the power to use it.
Vitas phasmatis ex silento.
Revertas phasmatis ut victus.
Vitas phasmatis ex silento.
Revertas phasmatis ut victus.
No.
What?
What is it?
They're angry at me for coming back here.
They don't wanna help.
Well, they have to.
They said there'll be consequences.
Well, he's just a kid.
Tell 'em to shut up.
Vitas phasmatis ex silento.
Revertas phasmatis ut victus.
Vitas phasmatis ex silento.
Revertas phasmatis ut victus.
Revertas phasmatis ut victus.
Vitas phasmatis ex silento.
Revertas...
Emily.
Emily!
I know you're there.
Please help me.
I love him.
No!
Oh, my God.
Bonnie.
Oh, my God, Jeremy.
Oh, my God.
What happened?
Doesn't matter.
You're ok.
You're ok.
Thank you.
Haven't left much for the Yankees to take, have we?
We'll have to make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition.
Elena.
Damon.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
We have to get you out of here.
We have to hide you where are we going?
Everywhere!
Wait for me.
I want to come with you.
Hey.
Hey.
Relax.
We need to get you out of here.
You're faster than I thought.
Why must you always run from me?
Because I know that you will chase.
Then let me chase you forever.
Feed me your blood.
I will not feed you, Damon.
If you want it, take it.
It is your choice to make.
I choose you, Katherine.
Look at me.
Hey.
It's Elena.
It's Elena.
Promise me you will not tell my brother.
I promise.
It will be our little secret.
No.
Damon.
No.
I have to...
If we are to be together forever.
Unh!
Damon, stop.
You're hurting me.
Damon, you don't have to do this.
Please stop.
You're hurting me!
Elena.
Damon.
Damon.
That was Bonnie.
Jeremy's alive.
I thought I killed him.
You did.
I don't understand.
I explained it to you once.
I...
I had to make you forget because I was so scared of what you might do.
But now...
I don't wanna lie.
I'm not gonna be afraid of you anymore.
I don't want you to be afraid of me anymore.
I'm still your little girl.
It's me.
It's me, mom.
Hey.
How you doing?
Trying to figure out what's wrong with me.
Feel different, weird.
Yeah, you were dead.
It'd be weird if you felt normal.
Bonnie, I, uh...
I don't know how to thank you.
You can thank me tomorrow.
And the day after that.
And the day after that.
Good night, Jeremy.
Good night.
Hey, bud.
I've gotta take off.
Need anything?
Uh, no, no.
I think I'm good.
You know, uh, on second thought,
I might just crash here.
Is that cool?
Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
Whatever.
All right.
Alaric, um...
Thank you for everything.
Ah, you can thank me tomorrow...
And the day after that, the day after that.
Dude, come on!
I knew you were listening.
And the day after that.
Elena.
It's ok, Damon.
I'm right here.
Elena, get out of here.
I could hurt you.
No.
You won't.
I'm here until the very end.
I'm not leaving you.
Get out of here.
Aah!
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hang on.
Shh.
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's not ok.
It's not ok.
All those years, I've blamed Stefan.
No one forced me to love her.
It was my own choice.
Shh.
I made the wrong choice.
You tell Stefan I'm sorry.
Ok?
I will.
You're very cooperative.
It's almost as if you're enjoying it.
No more.
Not until you give me the cure.
Not until we make a deal.
It's your choice, Stefan.
You can either remain here living your life in Mystic Falls, or you can embrace what you truly are, leave town with me, and save your brother's life.
That's the spirit.
Sweetheart...
Take this over to Damon and come right back.
You want me to leave?
- No!
- Yes.
And if I were you...
I'd hurry.
She'll never take it to him.
She'll never take it to him.
This is even more pitiful than I thought.
There's still hope.
I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here.
I deserve this.
I deserve to die.
No.
You don't.
I do, Elena.
It's ok.
'Cause if I'd have chosen differently,
I wouldn't have met you.
I'm so sorry.
Done so many things to hurt you.
It's ok.
I forgive you.
I know you love Stefan.
And it will always be Stefan.
But I love you.
You should know that.
I do.
You should have met me in 1864.
You would have liked me.
I like you now.
Just the way you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well, it's me you should be thanking.
I mean, I'm the one who brought the cure.
I thought you were dead.
I was.
You got free.
Yep.
Finally.
And you still came here?
I owed you one.
Where's Stefan?
Are you sure you care?
Where is he?
He's paying for this.
He gave himself over to Klaus.
I wouldn't expect him anytime soon.
What do you mean, "he gave himself over"?
He just sacrificed everything to save his brother, including you.
It's a good thing you have Damon to keep you company.
Good-bye, Elena.
Oh.
It's ok to love them both.
I did.
I suppose, brother, you've been reunited with our family.
Put him with the others.
We're leaving town tonight.
So...
Did katerina make it in time?
You won't be seeing her again, you know.
Because she's on vervain?
I've been around a long time, Stefan.
I rarely get played for a fool.
Besides, she won't get far.
You'll help me see to that.
What is it you really want from me?
All will be explained in time.
Once we leave this tragic little town.
Then are we done here?
Can we go?
Not quite.
You see, I have a gift for you.
Come here, sweetheart.
Don't be afraid.
See, I wanna make sure you honor our deal...
That you'll be of use to me.
I could have compelled her to behave, but a real ripper enjoys the hunt.
Now we can go.
Alaric?
Alaric.
Jer.
Anna?
Vicky?
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée.
I'm her fiancée.
He is my fiancée.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon."
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
"They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
- ...
I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are."
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
"Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
Carrot was here
ARTHUR (2011)
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
What do you suppose this does?
Oh!
Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
Tell them it's at a museum.
We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
What's it?
- Are we going to prison?
Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
Arthur.
Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
- Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored. "
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
- Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
naomi:
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
naomi:
Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
naomi:
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
- Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
naomi:
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
naomi:
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancé.
I'm her fiancé.
He is my fiancé.
naomi:
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
- Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
naomi:
Oh.
Oh, what was that?
naomi:
Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
naomi:
Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter. "
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter. "
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
I will see to it.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage. "
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
I don't trust them.
Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
naomi:
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
naomi:
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
naomi:
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
naomi:
Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
naomi:
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
naomi:
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
naomi:
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
naomi:
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
naomi:
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt. "
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Vivienne?
Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
naomi:
Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
naomi:
Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert. "
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
naomi:
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
naomi:
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach. " It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
naomi:
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy. "
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog. "
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon.
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
They were two close friends sitting alone together. "
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun. "
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean I have down days like anyone, but...
It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key. "
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
Listen to this: "Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes. "
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional. "
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
Vivienne.
Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money. "
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
- What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met. "
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache. "
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
- Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
naomi:
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
naomi:
Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie. " Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love. "
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
- That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur. "
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing. "
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem. "
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
naomi:
Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
- Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
- Ha.
... but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
- Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick. "
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are.
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom... "
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy. "
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
naomi:
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
- I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
Meth?
- No.
Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars. "
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't. "
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée.
I'm her fiancée.
He is my fiancée.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon."
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
"They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
- ...
I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are."
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
"Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
Carrot was here
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée.
I'm her fiancée.
He is my fiancée.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter. "
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt. "
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy. "
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog. "
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon."
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
"They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
- ...
I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5,10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money. "
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem. "
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
Ha.
... but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are."
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
"Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
Carrot was here
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
- Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
- Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
- Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancé.
I'm her fiancé.
He is my fiancé.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
- Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon.
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
- What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
- Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
- That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
- Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
- Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
- Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are.
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
- I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
Carrot was here
[PLAYS HARMONICA]
[MIMICS BATMAN] Cheers.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
[SIRENS WAILING]
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
OFFICER [OVER SPEAKER]:
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
ARTHUR:
What do you suppose this does?
[BOTH YELLING]
ARTHUR:
Oh!
BITTERMAN:
Ow!
BITTERMAN:
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
ARTHUR:
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
BITTERMAN:
Tell them it's at a museum.
ARTHUR:
We destroyed a beloved landmark.
BITTERMAN:
It's around here somewhere.
ARTHUR:
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS]
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
ARTHUR:
What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
OFFICER:
Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
BITTERMAN:
Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
CHANCELLOR:
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
[SUSAN SIGHS AND CELL PHONE BEEPS]
VIVIENNE:
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
[CHANCELLOR CHUCKLES]
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
[CELL PHONES RINGING]
[MURMURING]
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
[CHEERING AND SHOUTING]
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
[CHEERING]
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
[OPERA MUSIC PLAYING]
[GRUNTS]
[ARTHUR TIFFANY CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY]
ARTHUR:
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
[GASPS]
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
HOBSON:
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
HOBSON:
Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
ARTHUR:
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
HOBSON:
Arthur.
ARTHUR:
Oh, don't worry about all that.
TIFFANY:
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
[TIFFANY GRUNTS]
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
ARTHUR:
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
[ARTHUR SIGHS]
ARTHUR:
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
ARTHUR:
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
[ARTHUR CLICKING TONGUE]
RECEPTIONIST:
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
- Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
[SUSAN CHUCKLES]
VIVIENNE [OVER SPEAKER]:
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
[SIGHS]
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
ARTHUR:
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
[ARTHUR SIGHS]
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
AUCTIONEER:
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
[IN DEEP VOICE] Thirty thousand dollars, please.
AUCTIONEER:
Thirty thousand.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Thirty-five thousand.
[ALTERNATING VOICES] How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
HOBSON:
Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
ARTHUR:
Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
[IN DEEP VOICE] I'll take it.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
- Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
ARTHUR:
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
NAOMI:
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
NAOMI:
Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
NAOMI:
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
[NAOMI SCOFFS]
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
- Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
OFFICER:
Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
OFFICER:
West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
OFFICER:
We've got a runner.
ARTHUR:
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
NAOMI:
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
NAOMI:
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
ARTHUR:
No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancé.
I'm her fiancé.
He is my fiancé.
NAOMI:
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
- Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
NAOMI:
Oh.
Oh, what was that?
NAOMI:
Pe...
ARTHUR:
Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
[BOTH] PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
ARTHUR:
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
NAOMI:
Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
ARTHUR:
Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
ARTHUR:
Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
ARTHUR:
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
HOBSON:
Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUDING]
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
ARTHUR:
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
EVANDER:
I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
ARTHUR:
Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
[ARTHUR YELLS]
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
[DOOR CLOSES]
[LOCK CLICKS]
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
[AIR HISSES]
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
BURT:
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
[WHIRRING]
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
[ARTHUR YELLS]
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
[GULPS]
SUSAN:
Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
WAITER:
Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
WAITER:
I will see to it.
- Thank you.
WAITER:
For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
ARTHUR:
I don't trust them.
SUSAN:
Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
SUSAN:
All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
[MIMICS HORSE WHINNYING]
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
[GARGLES]
SUSAN:
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
[WOMAN GRUNTS]
[PATRONS GASP]
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
[CLANKING]
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
ARTHUR:
I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
[CLEARS THROAT]
ARTHUR:
I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
[LAUGHING]
[WHISPERS] Sit down.
Great.
[WHISPERS] Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
ARTHUR:
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
[APPLAUDING]
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
[SPITS]
NAOMI:
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
[CHUCKLES]
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
NAOMI:
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
NAOMI:
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
NAOMI:
Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
NAOMI:
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
ARTHUR:
Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
[LAUGHS]
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
[SOFT CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
[NAOMI LAUGHS]
NAOMI:
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
NAOMI:
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
[MIMICS PHONE RINGING]
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
[CHUCKLES]
NAOMI:
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
[CHUCKLES]
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
[GLASS CLINKS]
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
ARTHUR:
What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
NAOMI:
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
ARTHUR:
Mm.
[HUMS]
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
[CHUCKLES]
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
[MUMBLES]
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
[TRAIN PASSING NEARBY]
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
[NAOMI LAUGHS]
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
SUSAN:
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
[SUSAN CHUCKLES]
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
ARTHUR:
Vivienne?
VIVIENNE:
Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
BURT:
Hello.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS]
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
BURT:
Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
ARTHUR:
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
ARTHUR:
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
[SCREAMS]
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Which is why I've invited her here.
HOBSON:
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
[YELLS]
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS]
ARTHUR:
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
[CELL PHONE BEEPING]
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
ARTHUR:
Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
ARTHUR:
Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
NAOMI:
Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
NAOMI:
Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
[CARTOONS PLAYING ON TV]
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
[LAUGHS]
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
[SUSAN GRUNTS]
Susan, my buttons.
[LAUGHS]
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
[SUSAN MIMICS CAT]
Shh.
Shut up.
[MEOWS]
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
[LAUGHS]
ARTHUR:
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
[MEOWS]
ARTHUR:
No!
Unh.
Ow!
[NAOMI CHUCKLES]
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
NAOMI:
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
[NAOMI CHUCKLES]
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
ARTHUR:
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
[LAUGHS]
[GRUNTS]
SUSAN:
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
ARTHUR:
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
[YELLS]
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
[SUSAN GRUNTS]
[DOOR OPENS]
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
[WHISPERS] I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
NAOMI:
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach." ARTHUR:
It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
ARTHUR:
Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
[NAOMI CHUCKLES]
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
ARTHUR:
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
NAOMI:
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
[MIMICS TOAD] "Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
[IMITATES FROG] "When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
[IN NORMAL VOICE] And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
HOBSON: "And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon.
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
They were two close friends sitting alone together."
[ARTHUR SIGHS]
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
[SIGHS]
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
[MIMICS HOBSON] "Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
["TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR" PLAYING ON STEREO"]
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
[PHONES RINGING]
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean I have down days like anyone, but...
MAN:
It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
MAN:
Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
[SIGHS]
MAN IN COSTUME:
Hey!
MANAGER:
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
[REGISTER BEEPS]
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
[MANAGER CHUCKLES]
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
MANAGER:
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
[NAOMI ARTHUR CHUCKLE]
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
ARTHUR:
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
[NAOMI CHUCKLES]
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
[LAUGHING]
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
[GIRLS SCREAM]
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
ARTHUR:
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
[ARTHUR YELLS]
I've got one.
I'm okay.
MANAGER:
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
HOBSON:
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
Listen to this: "Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
[CHURCH BELL RINGING]
ARTHUR:
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
JAMES:
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
JAMES:
I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
[MURMURING]
JAMES:
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
ALL:
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
ALL:
Hi, Lillian.
HOBSON:
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
[WHISPERS] This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
ARTHUR:
Vivienne.
VIVIENNE [OVER PHONE]:
Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
[RINGS]
[DOOR OPENS]
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
- What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.

And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.

And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.

Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
CHOREOGRAPHER:
Good.
Now, under the arm.

Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.

I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
NAOMI:
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
ARTHUR [SINGING]:
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
[WOMEN LAUGH]
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
ALL:
Ooh.
- No metal.
ARTHUR:
Very nice.
[SINGING] Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
[ALL LAUGH]
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
[SINGING] Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
[ALL LAUGHING]
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
HOBSON:
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
[CHUCKLES]
- I'm so sorry.
NAOMI:
Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
[CELL PHONE VIBRATING]
Hey.
Hello.
What?
HOBSON:
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
[DOOR OPENS]
[HOBSON LAUGHING]
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
ARTHUR:
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
[SIGHS]
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
HOBSON:
Mm.
[ARTHUR CLEARS THROAT]
[DEVICE BEEPS]
HOBSON [IN DARTH VADER VOICE]:
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie." HOBSON:
Wash your winkie.
[LAUGHS]
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
HOBSON:
If you have to pay, it's not love.
ARTHUR:
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
ARTHUR:
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
[WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA]
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
- That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
- Only louder.
ARTHUR:
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
ARTHUR:
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
NAOMI:
Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
ARTHUR:
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
[CRASHING]
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
[CLANGING]
[BELL RINGS]
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
[CRASHING]
ARTHUR:
Oh, God, no!
- Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
- Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
NARRATOR [ON TV]:
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
HOBSON:
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
- Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
[HOBSON SCOFFS]
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
HOBSON:
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
[GRUNTS]
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
BITTERMAN:
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
[ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING]
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
[WHISPERS] The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
ARTHUR:
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
[WHISPERS] I'm a bit drunk.
[WHISPERS] Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
[SIGHS]
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]
Psst.
[WHISPERING] Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
BOY:
"You now know where the tea bags are.
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
Forever and ever, H."
[DOOR OPENS]
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
[MENDELSSOHN'S "WEDDING MARCH" PLAYING ON ORGAN]
[CRACKING]
MINISTER:
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
[CHUCKLES]
I object!
[ALL GASP]
ARTHUR:
To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
[ALL GASP]
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
[MURMURING]
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
[ARTHUR CLEARS THROAT]
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS AND GUESTS CHATTER]
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
[GUESTS GASP]
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
ARTHUR:
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
[WHISTLES]
VIVIENNE:
Arthur.
[VIVIENNE SIGHS]
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
ARTHUR:
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
ARTHUR:
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
ARTHUR:
No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
ARTHUR:
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
[ALL LAUGH]
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
[ALL LAUGH]
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
[ALL APPLAUD]
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
MAN:
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
NAOMI:
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
- I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
ARTHUR:
No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
GIRL:
Meth?
- No.
BOY:
Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
[SIGHS]
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
CHILDREN:
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
[NAOMI CHUCKLES]
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
[TIRES SCREECH]
ARTHUR:
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
[SIRENS WAILING]
carrot was here
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
- Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
- Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
- Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancé.
I'm her fiancé.
He is my fiancé.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
- Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon.
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
- ...
I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
- What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
- Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
- That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
- Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
- Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
- Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are.
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
- I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
carrot was here
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée.
I'm her fiancée.
He is my fiancée.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter. "
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt. "
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy. "
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog. "
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon."
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
"They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
- ...
I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5,10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money. "
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem. "
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
Ha.
... but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are."
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
"Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
Carrot was here
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée.
I'm her fiancée.
He is my fiancée.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter. "
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt. "
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy. "
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog. "
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon."
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
"They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
- ...
I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5,10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money. "
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem. "
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
Ha.
... but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are."
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
"Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
Carrot was here
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée.
I'm her fiancée.
He is my fiancée.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon."
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
"They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
- ...
I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are."
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
"Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
Carrot was here
{PLAYS HARMONICA}
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you want to go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
{SIRENS WAILING}
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Bat mobile.
We're their friends.
OFFICER {OVER SPEAKER}:
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
ARTHUR:
What do you suppose this does?
{BOTH YELLING}
ARTHUR:
Oh!
BITTERMAN:
Ow!
BITTERMAN:
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
ARTHUR:
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
BITTERMAN:
Tell them it's at a museum.
ARTHUR:
We destroyed a beloved landmark.
BITTERMAN:
It's around here somewhere.
ARTHUR:
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
{ARTHUR GRUNTS}
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
ARTHUR:
What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
OFFICER:
Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
BITTERMAN:
Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
CHANCELLOR:
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
{SUSAN SIGHS AND CELL PHONE BEEPS}
VIVIENNE:
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
{CHANCELLOR CHUCKLES}
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
{CELL PHONES RINGING}
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
{CHEERING AND SHOUTING}
{ARTHUR CHUCKLES}
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
{OPERA MUSIC PLAYING}
{ARTHUR TIFFANY CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY}
ARTHUR:
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
HOBSON:
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she goanna stay here?
HOBSON:
Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
ARTHUR:
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
HOBSON:
Arthur.
ARTHUR:
Oh, don't worry about all that.
TIFFANY:
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
{TIFFANY GRUNTS}
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
ARTHUR:
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
{ARTHUR SIGHS}
ARTHUR:
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harbouring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
ARTHUR:
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
{ARTHUR CLICKING TONGUE}
RECEPTIONIST:
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
- Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we goanna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
{SUSAN CHUCKLES}
VIVIENNE {OVER SPEAKER}:
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're goanna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
ARTHUR:
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm goanna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Bat mobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not goanna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't want to marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're goanna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
{ARTHUR SIGHS}
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the check book?
I want to squander some wealth.
AUCTIONEER:
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
{IN DEEP VOICE} Thirty thousand dollars, please.
AUCTIONEER:
Thirty thousand.
{IN NORMAL VOICE} Thirty-five thousand.
{ALTERNATING VOICES} How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
HOBSON:
Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
ARTHUR:
Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
{IN DEEP VOICE} I'll take it.
{IN NORMAL VOICE} And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
- Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was goanna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
ARTHUR:
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
NAOMI:
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
NAOMI:
Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
{INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE}
NAOMI:
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
{NAOMI SCOFFS}
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
- Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
OFFICER:
Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
OFFICER:
West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
OFFICER:
We've got a runner.
ARTHUR:
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was goanna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I got to take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
NAOMI:
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
NAOMI:
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
ARTHUR:
No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée.
I'm her fiancé©.
He is my fiancé©.
NAOMI:
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
- Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
NAOMI:
Oh.
Oh, what was that?
NAOMI:
Pe...
ARTHUR:
Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
ARTHUR:
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
{ARTHUR CHUCKLES}
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
NAOMI:
Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-treasured stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
ARTHUR:
Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
ARTHUR:
Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
ARTHUR:
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
HOBSON:
Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
{CHEERING AND APPLAUDING}
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm goanna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
ARTHUR:
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
EVANDER:
I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
ARTHUR:
Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
{ARTHUR YELLS}
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
{DOOR CLOSES}
{LOCK CLICKS}
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
{AIR HISSES}
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favourites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is goanna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
BURT:
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
{ARTHUR YELLS}
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
SUSAN:
Pascal, I'm goanna have the veal.
WAITER:
Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
WAITER:
I will see to it.
- Thank you.
WAITER:
For you, sir?
- Just a cauldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
ARTHUR:
I don't trust them.
SUSAN:
Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
SUSAN:
All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
{MIMICS HORSE WHINNYING}
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
SUSAN:
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
{WOMAN GRUNTS}
{PATRONS GASP}
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
ARTHUR:
I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
{CLEARS THROAT}
ARTHUR:
I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
ARTHUR:
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madame's et monsieur's, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're goanna be looked after and you're goanna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snob son.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
NAOMI:
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, live it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
NAOMI:
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
NAOMI:
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
NAOMI:
Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
NAOMI:
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
{ARTHUR CHUCKLES}
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
ARTHUR:
Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilt's, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilt's to see the world from God's perspective.
{SOFT CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING}
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
{NAOMI LAUGHS}
NAOMI:
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you want to go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
NAOMI:
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
{MIMICS PHONE RINGING}
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm goanna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've got to go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
NAOMI:
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
{GLASS CLINKS}
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
ARTHUR:
What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au natural.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
NAOMI:
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
ARTHUR:
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was goanna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had travelled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
{TRAIN PASSING NEARBY}
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
{NAOMI LAUGHS}
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
SUSAN:
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
{SUSAN CHUCKLES}
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
ARTHUR:
Vivienne?
VIVIENNE:
Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
BURT:
Hello.
{ARTHUR GRUNTS}
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
BURT:
Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
ARTHUR:
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
{HORSE NEIGHS}
ARTHUR:
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you want to cancel the wedding.
We're not goanna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those goanna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not goanna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
{DOORBELL RINGS}
Which is why I've invited her here.
HOBSON:
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all goanna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not goanna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're goanna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
{ARTHUR GRUNTS}
ARTHUR:
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
{CELL PHONE BEEPING}
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
{BOTH CHUCKLE}
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm goanna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
{DOORBELL RINGS}
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
ARTHUR:
Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were goanna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
ARTHUR:
Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
NAOMI:
Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've got to primp.
NAOMI:
Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé©?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
{CARTOONS PLAYING ON TV}
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you want to stay?
This is a really good one.
PepÃ© tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicity©.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
{SUSAN GRUNTS}
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
{SUSAN MIMICS CAT}
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
ARTHUR:
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
ARTHUR:
No!
Unh.
Ow!
{NAOMI CHUCKLES}
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
NAOMI:
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
{NAOMI CHUCKLES}
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
ARTHUR:
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
SUSAN:
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
ARTHUR:
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm goanna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not goanna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've got to go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
{SUSAN GRUNTS}
{DOOR OPENS}
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbours.
- Neighbours?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
Ididit forher .
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
NAOMI:
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach." ARTHUR:
It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
ARTHUR:
Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
{NAOMI CHUCKLES}
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
ARTHUR:
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
NAOMI:
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
{MIMICS TOAD} "Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
{IMITATES FROG} "When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
{IN NORMAL VOICE} And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
HOBSON: "And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon.
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
They were two close friends sitting alone together."
{ARTHUR SIGHS}
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
{MIMICS HOBSON} "Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
{"TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR" PLAYING ON STEREO"}
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
{PHONES RINGING}
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean I have down days like anyone, but...
MAN:
It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
MAN:
Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
MAN IN COSTUME:
Hey!
MANAGER:
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
{REGISTER BEEPS}
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
{MANAGER CHUCKLES}
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
MANAGER:
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
{NAOMI ARTHUR CHUCKLE}
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
{ARTHUR CHUCKLES}
ARTHUR:
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
{NAOMI CHUCKLES}
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
{GIRLS SCREAM}
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
ARTHUR:
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
{ARTHUR YELLS}
I've got one.
I'm okay.
MANAGER:
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
HOBSON:
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
Listen to this: "Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
{CHURCH BELL RINGING}
ARTHUR:
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
JAMES:
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
JAMES:
I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
JAMES:
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
ALL:
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's goanna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
ALL:
Hi, Lillian.
HOBSON:
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kind-hearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Bat mobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
Thisisitchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
ARTHUR:
Vivienne.
VIVIENNE {OVER PHONE}:
Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
{DOOR OPENS}
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may want to sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was goanna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pyjamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't want to marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
- What, lied to?
I was goanna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.

At least you could just try to smile.

And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.

Oh.

Finally.
CHOREOGRAPHER:
Good.
Now, under the arm.

I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
NARRATOR {ON TV}:
- Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm travelling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
{DOOR CLOSES}
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
{DOORBELL RINGS}
NAOMI:
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
{PIANO MUSIC PLAYING}
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
ARTHUR :
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
{WOMEN LAUGH}
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
ALL:
Ooh.
- No metal.
ARTHUR:
Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
{ALL LAUGH}
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
{ALL LAUGHING}
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
HOBSON:
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
NAOMI:
Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
{CELL PHONE VIBRATING}
Hey.
Hello.
What?
HOBSON:
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
{DOOR OPENS}
{HOBSON LAUGHING}
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
ARTHUR:
That's part of a display.
They didn't want to sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
HOBSON:
Mm.

{DEVICE BEEPS}
HOBSON {IN DARTH VADER VOICE}:
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie." HOBSON:

HOBSON:
If you have to pay, it's not love.
ARTHUR:
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
ARTHUR:
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you want to see her?
You see her for me, will you?
{WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA}
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
- That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
{ARTHUR CHUCKLES}
- Only louder.
ARTHUR:
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was goanna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was goanna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was goanna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was goanna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
ARTHUR:
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
NAOMI:
Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's goanna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favour.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever goanna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
ARTHUR:
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
{BELL RINGS}
Be careful of that plate.
It's goanna be very, very...
ARTHUR:
Oh, God, no!
- Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
- Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
NARRATOR {ON TV}:
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
HOBSON:
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
- Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
{HOBSON SCOFFS}
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
HOBSON:
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not goanna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're goanna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
BITTERMAN:
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm goanna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
{ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING}
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
Thegroomis here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
ARTHUR:
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'ma bitdrunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
{DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES}
Psst.
Smallperson.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
BOY:
"You now know where the tea bags are.
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
Forever and ever, H."
{DOOR OPENS}
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
{MENDELSSOHN'S "WEDDING MARCH" PLAYING ON ORGAN}
MINISTER:
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honourable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
{ALL GASP}
ARTHUR:
To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you before...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
{ALL GASP}
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
{ARTHUR CLEARS THROAT}
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
{ARTHUR GRUNTS AND GUESTS CHATTER}
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally... {GUESTS GASP}
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
ARTHUR:
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've got to get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
VIVIENNE:
Arthur.
{VIVIENNE SIGHS}
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
ARTHUR:
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
ARTHUR:
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
ARTHUR:
No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
ARTHUR:
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is goanna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And... {ALL LAUGH}
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
{ALL LAUGH}
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
{ALL APPLAUD}
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
MAN:
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
NAOMI:
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
- I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
ARTHUR:
No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
GIRL:
Meth?
- No.
BOY:
Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
CHILDREN:
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
{NAOMI CHUCKLES}
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
{TIRES SCREECH}
ARTHUR:
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
{SIRENS WAILING}
carrot was here
Encoded by ripper
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée.
I'm her fiancée.
He is my fiancée.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon."
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
"They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
- ...
I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are."
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
"Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
Carrot was here
HQ-Encoders Release
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée.
I'm her fiancée.
He is my fiancée.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon."
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
"They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
- ...
I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are."
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
"Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
Carrot was here
Cheers.
Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
- What do you suppose this does?
- Oh!
- Ow!
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
- Tell them it's at a museum.
- We destroyed a beloved landmark.
It's around here somewhere.
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
- What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
- Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
- Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
- Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
- Arthur.
- Oh, don't worry about all that.
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
Thirty thousand dollars, please.
Thirty thousand.
Thirty-five thousand.
How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
- Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
- Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
I'll take it.
And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
- Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
- Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
- West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
We've got a runner.
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
- No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancée.
I'm her fiancée.
He is my fiancée.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
- Oh.
Oh, what was that?
- Pe...
- Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
- Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
- Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
- Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
- Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
- I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
- Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
- Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
- Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
- I will see to it.
- Thank you.
- For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
- I don't trust them.
- Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
- All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
- I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
- I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
Sit down.
Great.
Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
- Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
- What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
Mm.
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
- Vivienne?
- Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
- Hello.
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
- Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
Which is why I've invited her here.
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
- Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
- Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
- Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
- Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
Susan, my buttons.
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
Shh.
Shut up.
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
No!
Unh.
Ow!
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach."
- It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
- Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
"Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
"When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
"And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon."
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
"They were two close friends sitting alone together."
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
"Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
- ...
I have down days like anyone, but...
- It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
- Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
Hey!
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
I've got one.
I'm okay.
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
"Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
- I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Lillian.
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
- Vivienne.
- Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
Closet.
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
Solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.
This mother bear has no...
- What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
- Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
Ooh.
- No metal.
- Very nice.
Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
Hey.
Hello.
What?
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
- Mm.
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie."
- Wash your winkie.
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
If you have to pay, it's not love.
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
- Only louder.
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
- Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
Oh, God, no!
Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
I'm a bit drunk.
Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
Psst.
Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
"You now know where the tea bags are."
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
"Forever and ever, H."
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
I object!
- To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
Arthur.
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
- No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
- No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
- Meth?
- No.
- Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
[PLAYS HARMONICA]
[MIMICS BATMAN] Cheers.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
[SlRENS wailing]
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
officer [OVER SPEAKER]:
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
-Where are the brakes on this thing?
ARTHUR:
What do you suppose this does?
[BOTH yelling]
ARTHUR:
Oh!
BlTTERMAN:
Ow!
BlTTERMAN:
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
ARTHUR:
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
BlTTERMAN:
Tell them it's at a museum.
ARTHUR:
We destroyed a beloved landmark.
BlTTERMAN:
It's around here somewhere.
ARTHUR:
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS]
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
-Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
ARTHUR:
What's it--?
-Are we going to prison?
officer:
Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
BlTTERMAN:
Yes.
-I knew this day would come and it's today.
CHANCELLOR:
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
[SUSAN sighs AND CELL PHONE BEEPS]
VlVlENNE:
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
-He's begun to take an interest in finance.
-Wonderful.
[CHANCELLOR CHUCKLES]
-Could you excuse us?
-Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
[CELL PHONES ringing]
[MURMURlNG]
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
[cheering AND shouting]
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession....
Free money!
[cheering]
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
[OPERA music playing]
[GRUNTS]
[ARTHUR tiffany CONVERSlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY]
ARTHUR:
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
[GASPS]
-Hello, Hobson.
-Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
-Your nanny?
-He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
HOBSON:
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
-ls she gonna stay here?
HOBSON:
Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
-That lady has never once breast-fed me.
-Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
ARTHUR:
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
-Oh, that's actually mine.
-Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
HOBSON:
Arthur.
ARTHUR:
Oh, don't worry about all that.
tiffany:
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
[tiffany GRUNTS]
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
ARTHUR:
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
[ARTHUR sighs]
ARTHUR:
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
-Hobson!
Hobson!
-What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
ARTHUR:
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
-I don't like it here, Hobson.
-Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
[ARTHUR clicking TONGUE]
receptionist:
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
-I understood the reference.
-I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
-Really?
-Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things...
-...
like talking.
-Oh, ha, ha.
-What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
-Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
[SUSAN CHUCKLES]
VlVlENNE [OVER SPEAKER]:
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
[sighs]
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
ARTHUR:
Mm--
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
-Congratulations.
-How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
-Susan Johnson.
-lnteresting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
-Why?
-Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
-I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
-Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the...?
You don't mean cut off from the...?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
[ARTHUR sighs]
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
AUCTlONEER:
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
[lN DEEP voice] Thirty thousand dollars, please.
AUCTlONEER:
Thirty thousand.
[lN NORMAL voice] Thirty-five thousand.
[ALTERNATlNG voices] How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
-Thank you, sirs.
HOBSON:
Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas ll.
-Me too.
ARTHUR:
Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
[lN DEEP voice] I'll take it.
[lN NORMAL voice] And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny...
-...you're deluded.
-Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
-Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
-Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
-Where?
-He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
ARTHUR:
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
naomi:
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
-Oh.
-Oh!
-Sorry.
-No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um....
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
-Come on.
-Coins.
-I played with these when I was a boy.
naomi:
Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
[lNAUDlBLE dialogue]
naomi:
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way-- Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
[naomi SCOFFS]
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a...
-...police officer.
-Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
-MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
-Could you be more specific?
officer:
Hey.
Hey!
-Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
-Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
officer:
West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
officer:
We've got a runner.
ARTHUR:
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm-- l--
-No, no, no.
-I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
naomi:
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
-Yes, exactly.
-And also we have....
naomi:
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
-Oh, no.
ARTHUR:
No.
-He is my admittedly eccentric--
-Fiancé.
I'm her fiancé.
He is my fiancé.
naomi:
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me...
-...from our first date.
-Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
-Didn't they, Naomi?
-No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just-- We had clothes on and we ate.
-What'd you eat?
naomi:
Oh.
Oh, what was that?
naomi:
Pe-- ARTHUR:
Pe-
- Pe-
- Pe--
[BOTH] PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
ARTHUR:
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
-Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
naomi:
Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
ARTHUR:
Bitterman, close that door.
-Get in the car.
-Not you, Bitterman.
ARTHUR:
Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
ARTHUR:
Oh, hang-
- Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
-I don't date boys who have nannies.
HOBSON:
Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
-Uh-- Did you remember that?
-No.
[cheering AND applauding]
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
ARTHUR:
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
-Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
EVANDER:
I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
-She could be the one.
ARTHUR:
Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
-Are you okay?
-I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
-Well, you were bored after a week.
-Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
-Aah!
That's vodka in there.
-Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
-Get dressed.
-Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
-Stick and move, like you taught me.
-Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
[ARTHUR YELLS]
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
-But if you were me....
-I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
-But I don't love his daughter.
-Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
[DOOR CLOSES]
[LOCK clicks]
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
[air HlSSES]
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
-Uh, sorry, I've never used--
-Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
BURT:
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo....
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
-Yes.
-Table saw.
[WHlRRlNG]
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
-No, I don't like things like this.
-Come on.
You can do it.
No-
- Just, uh-
- Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
-Let's saw something else in half.
-How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
-My tongue?
-Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
-No, Burt!
What are you doing?
-Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
[ARTHUR YELLS]
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"l like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
[GULPS]
SUSAN:
Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
WAlTER:
Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
WAlTER:
I will see to it.
-Thank you.
WAlTER:
For you, sir?
-Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we- "Loveless marriage."
-We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
-I do.
ARTHUR:
I don't trust them.
SUSAN:
Think about this.
-Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
-This is a business-
- Stay with me.
-Their shoes are permanent.
SUSAN:
All you have to do--
-Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
-Most marriages devolve eventually.
-Mean faces.
[MlMlCS HORSE whinnying]
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
-Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
-I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
[GARGLES]
SUSAN:
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
[WOMAN GRUNTS]
[PATRONS GASP]
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
-Well done.
Go on.
-Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
-Coming in the kitchen.
-lsn't he mad?
[CLANKlNG]
I'm a naughty robot.
-But I just love him.
ARTHUR:
I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
[CLEARS THROAT]
ARTHUR:
I think this sausage is cooked.
-Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
[laughing]
[whispers] Sit down.
Great.
[whispers] Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
-ls that clear?
-Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
ARTHUR:
Susan.
Pfft.
-Are you sure about this?
-You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
[APPLAUDlNG]
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
-I erased her number.
-Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
[SPlTS]
naomi:
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
-I'm bored too.
-Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
-Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
-Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um--
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
[CHUCKLES]
-Wow, you look really, really amazing.
-Okay.
-I've got something to show you.
-I don't--
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
-Okay.
-Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
naomi:
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
-There's a waiter on that escalator.
-Shh.
naomi:
He's in formal attire.
-He's carrying a platter.
-Wait for it.
Excellent.
-Your dinner, madam.
naomi:
Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
naomi:
Do you want me?
-Thank you.
-Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
-This is better.
ARTHUR:
Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so....
Oh, already winning.
[LAUGHS]
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
[SOFT classical music playing]
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
[naomi LAUGHS]
naomi:
Arthur, this is....
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and....
Italy.
-What?
-Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
-Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
-I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
-Naomi...
-Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
naomi:
After we moved to New York when I was 1 1 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
[MlMlCS PHONE ringing]
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
-It's acoustics.
-Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
[CHUCKLES]
naomi:
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
[CHUCKLES]
What is this, please?
-Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
-Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
[GLASS CLlNKS]
-Mademoiselle, you are--
-Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
ARTHUR:
What?
-My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
-No, no, no, really, it's okay.
-I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh....
-Point, Naomi.
-Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
naomi:
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
-Cheers.
-I don't think that's the lesson.
-It's the lesson I learned.
-Cheers.
ARTHUR:
Mm.
[HUMS]
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken....
-Ha, ha, yes.
-I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
-What a weirdo.
-I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n--
[CHUCKLES]
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
[MUMBLES]
-My dad's pills.
-Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la-
- What's this for?
-That's nothing.
That's--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
-Naomi, that's wonderful.
-Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
-I can't.
-Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and--
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
[train passing NEARBY]
But this doesn't wake your father?
-He's used to this.
-This could wake my father.
From his grave.
[naomi LAUGHS]
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
SUSAN:
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
[SUSAN CHUCKLES]
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
ARTHUR:
Vivienne?
VlVlENNE:
Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you...
-...and your future father-in-law?
-What?
No, no.
-Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
BURT:
Hello.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS]
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
-Yes.
-My turn, Daddy.
-Oh, Jesus.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
-Maybe Daddy could help?
BURT:
Yeah, let me help.
-No, it's all right, Burt.
-Help him up.
ARTHUR:
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're-
- That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr--
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
[HORSE neighs]
ARTHUR:
Wha--?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
[SCREAMS]
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I.
She's spontaneous and....
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off--
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
[DOORBELL rings]
Which is why I've invited her here.
HOBSON:
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
[YELLS]
-Hi, Hobson.
-Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS]
ARTHUR:
Mm-mm.
-What was that?
-A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
[CELL PHONE beeping]
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
-You're a bit drunk.
-Okay.
So you just, uh....
You wait here.
Oh, no.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
-Um, I'm gonna get ice.
-What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
[DOORBELL rings]
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
-You are?
ARTHUR:
Um--
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in--
-I can see why.
-But, actually, why don't we--?
-This is amazing.
-Uh, no.
Um--
-That fish looks like a cat.
ARTHUR:
Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
naomi:
Wow, bubblegum rocket.
-Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
naomi:
Oh, that's you.
-Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
[CARTOONS playing ON TV]
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
-Really?
-No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
-Ooh.
-I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
[LAUGHS]
-That's the problem, actually.
-Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
-I'm just helping you to get dressed.
-Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
[SUSAN GRUNTS]
Susan, my buttons.
[LAUGHS]
How much have you had to drink?
-Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
-Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
-Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't--
-Oh, that's....
That's nice.
-Try not to speak any words.
-Mm-hm.
[SUSAN MlMlCS CAT]
Shh.
Shut up.
[MEOWS]
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
[LAUGHS]
ARTHUR:
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get-
- Ow!
[MEOWS]
ARTHUR:
No!
Unh.
Ow!
[naomi CHUCKLES]
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
naomi:
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
-No, not really.
-Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
[naomi CHUCKLES]
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
ARTHUR:
Ow!
Ow!
-Bad horse.
-Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
[LAUGHS]
[GRUNTS]
SUSAN:
Arthur.
-What's happening?
-Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
-Oh, you think so?
-Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
-Uh-- Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
-Get me off of here!
ARTHUR:
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna-
- Ah, got it.
-What are you doing?
-Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
[YELLS]
-Oh, are you all right?
-Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
[SUSAN GRUNTS]
[DOOR OPENS]
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um-
- It's the bloody neighbors.
-Neighbors?
-Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
[whispers] I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
-You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
-Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
naomi:
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
-Are you a bit chilly?
-Oh, yes.
-Would you like--?
-Thank you.
Ahem, here.
-ls this your father's? "Gerald Bach." ARTHUR:
It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
ARTHUR:
Mm.
-Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
-Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
-It's my calling.
[naomi CHUCKLES]
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
-Come with me.
Come on.
-Okay.
ARTHUR:
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
-Really?
-Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
naomi:
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
[MlMlCS TOAD] "Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
[lMlTATES FROG] "When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
[lN NORMAL voice] And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
HOBSON: "And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon.
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
They were two close friends sitting alone together."
[ARTHUR sighs]
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
[sighs]
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
[MlMlCS HOBSON] "Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
-I think I could live without the money.
-Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
-Ha!
-What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
["TWlNKLE, twinkle, little STAR" playing ON STEREO"]
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
[PHONES ringing]
-Do you know how to use Excel?
-No.
-PowerPoint?
-No.
-Outlook.
-Generally positive.
You know, I mean...
-...
I have down days like anyone, but-- MAN:
It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
-File?
MAN:
Yes.
In a...?
No.
There must be something I can do.
[sighs]
MAN lN COSTUME:
Hey!
MANAGER:
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
[register BEEPS]
-Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
-Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
[MANAGER CHUCKLES]
-lt says "invalid key."
-Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over--?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
-You can't do it, and you never will.
-Never?
That's harsh.
MANAGER:
I've entered your employee number and-
- Oh.
Want some?
-I think you should take the day off.
-As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
[naomi ARTHUR CHUCKLE]
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
ARTHUR:
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
[naomi CHUCKLES]
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
[laughing]
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
[girls SCREAM]
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
ARTHUR:
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
-Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
-Arthur?
-Hello.
-What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
[ARTHUR YELLS]
I've got one.
I'm okay.
MANAGER:
Arthur.
-May I have a word with you?
-ls that word "promotion"?
HOBSON:
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
Listen to this: "Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
[CHURCH BELL ringing]
ARTHUR:
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
JAMES:
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
-Jesus.
JAMES:
I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
[MURMURlNG]
JAMES:
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave--
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
-Shh.
-lt is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
ALL:
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
ALL:
Hi, Lillian.
HOBSON:
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
[whispers] This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
ARTHUR:
Vivienne.
VlVlENNE [OVER PHONE]:
Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
[rings]
[DOOR OPENS]
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
-I was gonna get Hobson to do it--
-Oh, my God.
Arthur.
-Who do you think you are?
-Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
-Susan woman.
-But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
-Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
-Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person...
-...that I have ever--
-What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What--?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
-I thought a million would be vulgar.
-We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.
[ARTHUR sighs]

CHOREOGRAPHER:
And back, two, three.
Front, two, three.
Back.
And here we turn.
This is gonna be our first dance as husband and wife.
At least you could just try to smile.
Sorry.
And I apologize for leaving you attached to that magnetic bed.
SUSAN:
Oh.
Someone's coming to his senses.
Finally.
CHOREOGRAPHER:
Good.
Now, under the arm.
Hobson.
Hobson!
Hobson.
I've just spotted Orphan Annie as a man.
Orphan Mannie!
Bitterman.
What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
-Hobson's got a headache?
-Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.
NARRATOR [ON TV]:
--solely on their mother for food, shelter and safety.

-What's the matter?
Why are you in bed?
-Arthur, put my bears back on.
There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.
[sighs]
I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.
Who's that red gentleman with a pitchfork?
Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
-lt didn't last very long, but I have hopes--
-AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to--
-He's getting married.
-Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
[DOORBELL rings]
naomi:
Who was that?
Um....
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
[piano music playing]
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
ARTHUR [singing]:
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
[WOMEN LAUGH]
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
ALL:
Ooh.
-No metal.
ARTHUR:
Very nice.
[singing] Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
[ALL LAUGH]
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
[singing] Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
[ALL laughing]
Because she does that.
I've been-- I've been horribly emasculated.
HOBSON:
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
[CHUCKLES]
-I'm so sorry.
naomi:
Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
-Arthur, hasn't it been--?
-Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
[CELL PHONE vibrating]
Hey.
Hello.
What?
HOBSON:
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
[DOOR OPENS]
[HOBSON laughing]
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
-The biggest ones in the shop.
-Can I have one?
ARTHUR:
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
[sighs]
Humiliating.
-You look really dignified.
HOBSON:
Mm.
[ARTHUR CLEARS THROAT]
[device BEEPS]
HOBSON [lN DARTH VADER voice]:
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
-Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie." HOBSON:
Wash your winkie.
[LAUGHS]
Say, "lf you have to pay them, it's not love."
HOBSON:
If you have to pay, it's not love.
ARTHUR:
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr.?
ARTHUR:
Sammy Davis, Jr. is not to do with that costume.
-I like Sammy.
-What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
-Where's Naomi?
-Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
[WOMAN speaking lNDlSTlNCTLY ON PA]
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything...
-...because we're not family.
-That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
-Only louder.
ARTHUR:
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
ARTHUR:
Ah.
Well....
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
-You're a tour guide, right?
naomi:
Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
-Doesn't matter, does it?
-Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
-They're all the same.
-Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of--
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented--
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
ARTHUR:
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
[crashing]
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
-Just put the whole bag in?
-Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
-Brilliant.
-But not out of the tap.
-From a--?
-Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
[CLANGlNG]
[BELL rings]
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very--
[crashing]
ARTHUR:
Oh, God, no!
--hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
-Really?
-Mm-hm.
-It's not unpleasant, is it?
-Well, it is unpleasant...
-Ha.
-...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
NARRATOR [ON TV]:
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
HOBSON:
Come on, come on, come on.
-No.
Not like this.
-Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave--
I had my bags all packed.
--your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
[HOBSON SCOFFS]
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
-Why are you telling me now?
-I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
HOBSON:
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
[GRUNTS]
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
BlTTERMAN:
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
-Just say something incongruous or pithy.
-Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
[ORGAN music playing]
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
-I am so delighted you're here.
-Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
[whispers] The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
ARTHUR:
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
-Oh, God.
She's here.
-You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't-
- Don't-
- Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
[whispers] I'm a bit drunk.
[whispers] Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
[sighs]
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]
Psst.
[whispering] Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
BOY:
"You now know where the tea bags are.
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
Forever and ever, H."
[DOOR OPENS]
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
[MENDELSSOHN'S "wedding MARCH" playing ON ORGAN]
[cracking]
minister:
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
[CHUCKLES]
I object!
[ALL GASP]
ARTHUR:
To this wedding.
-Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
-I'm your best man.
-I've never seen you befor--
-Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
-I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just-
- Statistically--
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom--"
[ALL GASP]
That's my little girl.
-You will marry me.
-No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
[MURMURlNG]
-Hit him in the face.
-No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
[ARTHUR CLEARS THROAT]
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS AND GUESTS CHATTER]
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally....
[GUESTS GASP]
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I....
I think I'll hang onto them.
-I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
-Yes.
ARTHUR:
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
-ls there anywhere I could take you, sir?
-Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
[whistles]
VlVlENNE:
Arthur.
[VlVlENNE sighs]
-Once again, you've humiliated me.
-Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
-For the cab.
-Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
ARTHUR:
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
ARTHUR:
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
-You're wasted, Arthur.
ARTHUR:
No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
-Oh, okay.
-Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
-Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
-No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so....
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
ARTHUR:
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um....
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um--
A prostitute.
And....
[ALL LAUGH]
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
[ALL LAUGH]
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
[ALL APPLAUD]
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
MAN:
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
naomi:
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
-I mind.
-Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds--
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
--I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um--
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
-Are you a girl or a boy?
-Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
-What a bitch.
-She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
-Do you mean drugs?
ARTHUR:
No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
girl:
Meth?
-No.
BOY:
Crack?
-No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
[sighs]
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
children:
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
[naomi CHUCKLES]
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
-It's better for me.
-What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
-Oh.
-Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of-- Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
-So I guess your mother forgave you.
-Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
[tires SCREECH]
ARTHUR:
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
[SlRENS wailing]
[PLAYS HARMONICA]
[MIMICS BATMAN] Cheers.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Bitterman?
Why are you shaving?
Because Robin doesn't have a beard.
Bitterman, we're only doing this for a bit of a laugh.
We're not genuine crime fighters, are we?
And if we were, you would not be my first choice of sidekick.
Look at your shoes.
They're your chauffeur shoes, aren't they?
I can see your tummy.
Mr. Bach, are you sure you wanna go to your mother's fundraiser like this?
I think it's black-tie.
This is black.
Just that Hobson said not to get into any trouble.
What trouble could possibly come from a harmless game of dress-up?
Hmm?
Already bought the car.
[SIRENS WAILING]
You think they're chasing us?
Don't be ridiculous, this is the Batmobile.
We're their friends.
OFFICER [OVER SPEAKER]:
Driver, pull the car over.
How do you slow down?
- Where are the brakes on this thing?
ARTHUR:
What do you suppose this does?
[BOTH YELLING]
ARTHUR:
Oh!
BITTERMAN:
Ow!
BITTERMAN:
Ask the police for directions to your mother's fundraiser.
ARTHUR:
I think that problem has been recently superseded.
BITTERMAN:
Tell them it's at a museum.
ARTHUR:
We destroyed a beloved landmark.
BITTERMAN:
It's around here somewhere.
ARTHUR:
I need you to not to talk for a little while.
Good evening, officers.
What seems to be the problem?
You're drunk again, Arthur.
No.
I have remained drunk since our last encounter.
Let's go.
Batman and Robin, out of the car.
Come on.
Could I just point out the elephant in the room?
Are these testicles strictly necessary?
They're an accident waiting to happen.
Okay, let's go.
Come on.
See, I don't like being this close to these balls.
I'll be right with you.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS]
Gotham is safe.
Oh, man.
If I could just write you a check for the damage to your golden cow we can all be about our business.
Say no more.
- Or not.
Turn around.
Come on.
ARTHUR:
What's it...?
- Are we going to prison?
OFFICER:
Yes.
We're going to prison.
We're going to prison, Bitterman.
BITTERMAN:
Yes.
- I knew this day would come and it's today.
CHANCELLOR:
That's all well and good but it's not a market crash we're concerned about.
Your concerns are legitimate, chancellor.
[SUSAN SIGHS AND CELL PHONE BEEPS]
VIVIENNE:
I do assure you that Arthur's a bit more serious these days.
- He's begun to take an interest in finance.
- Wonderful.
[CHANCELLOR CHUCKLES]
- Could you excuse us?
- Sure.
I'm sorry, Vivienne.
The university cannot wager its endowment on a fund with such an uncertain future.
[CELL PHONES RINGING]
[MURMURING]
He's like a ship without an anchor.
Maybe it's time we tied him to another ship.
[CHEERING AND SHOUTING]
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
Tito!
Tito, I'll see you at the cockfight.
Better be what I think it is.
Wow, you paid for everyone's release?
It seemed unfair that we'd leave and that they'd remain.
How do you explain this frivolous spending during a recession?
Fair point.
Uh, recession...
Free money!
[CHEERING]
This is yours.
Okay, recession's over!
We're in a boom!
[OPERA MUSIC PLAYING]
[GRUNTS]
[ARTHUR TIFFANY CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY]
ARTHUR:
That was brave.
What incredible flexibility.
[GASPS]
- Hello, Hobson.
- Morning, Arthur.
And friend.
Tiffany.
Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
I made a mental association with my lamp.
Tiffany, this is my nanny, Hobson, my best friend in the whole world.
- Your nanny?
- He's merely shaped like an adult.
So how are you feeling on the other side of that vast moat of champagne called "last night"?
Splendid.
Your mother called.
She wants to see you this morning.
Vivienne?
Why do you think Vivienne wants to see me today?
It doesn't make sense.
HOBSON:
After destroying a world-famous landmark and giving away $78,000 from an ATM, I can't imagine.
- Is she gonna stay here?
HOBSON:
Um I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear.
He's got an addictive personality, you know.
He was at mine till he was 6.
Hobson.
I had to dab Tabasco on the nipples to see him off.
- That lady has never once breast-fed me.
- Despite his best efforts.
Hey, that's my purse.
ARTHUR:
Oh.
Look, I don't know how that got in there.
I don't know, Arthur.
It's probably just one of those mysteries that will never be discovered.
JFK, who nicked my watch.
- Oh, that's actually mine.
- Bravo, well done.
Something of yours in your handbag.
No, you don't have to go through the pictures, actually.
HOBSON:
Arthur.
ARTHUR:
Oh, don't worry about all that.
TIFFANY:
That's very rude.
Invasion of privacy.
[TIFFANY GRUNTS]
Oh, you're leaving?
I support your decision 100 percent.
Will you be requiring a taxi or just getting into a random passing car?
You guys are weird and racist.
ARTHUR:
Bye-bye, Tiffany.
I'll call you, if you've not stolen my phone.
Help yourself to that priceless sculpture on your way out the door.
Put it down.
Say goodbye to your other new friends now, Arthur.
They have to go back to the real world.
Oh, I hate the real world, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today if you don't mind.
Hobson.
Breakfast, now.
Here.
[ARTHUR SIGHS]
ARTHUR:
Hobson!
Hobson?
Hobson!
Hobson!
Hobson!
- Hobson!
Hobson!
- What?
Lesbian Simon and Garfunkel, 61st and Park.
Look.
Hmm.
Well spotted.
Another of your wasted talents.
Wash your winkie.
Thoroughly.
Heaven knows what exotic wildlife that girl was harboring between her thighs.
Whoa, Hobson.
You're missing Asian you.
ARTHUR:
Ah!
You're going too quickly.
You're pushing it too hard.
- I don't like it here, Hobson.
- Course you don't.
People work here.
But there's an elevator.
You get to press the buttons.
Silver lining.
[ARTHUR CLICKING TONGUE]
RECEPTIONIST:
Mr. Bach?
Your mother will see you now.
Don't worry, Arthur, it won't take long.
Then we'll watch cartoons.
Hello, Arthur.
Oh, hello, Susan.
I didn't see you there coming down this long, brightly-lit, unobstructed corridor walking straight towards me.
I owe you a call, don't I?
From January.
We dated three months.
You just disappeared.
When Houdini did it, it was fun.
Hmm.
Houdini was a conjurer.
He used to disappear.
- I understood the reference.
- I just thought it deserved more.
You know, you're the only man I ever slept with who broke up with me.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, call me a romantic but I believe that dating should involve crazy things like talking.
- Oh, ha, ha.
- What are we gonna do with you, Arthur?
- Release me into the wild.
Hunt me down with dogs.
Good luck with your mother.
[SUSAN CHUCKLES]
VIVIENNE [OVER SPEAKER]:
Come in, Arthur.
Oh, hello.
The future's now.
Hello, Vivienne.
I remember you from when I used to live in your womb.
Arthur.
Well, today, Arthur, we're gonna have a friendly chat.
Then a serious talk.
And finally, I'm going to offer you an ultimatum.
How does all that sound?
Like it would be improved by vodka.
So I hear you've been having fun.
Quite the contrary, actually.
I've been rather busy.
I've got a riding boot shoot and, uh, I had a bit of a scare with Bitterman.
Thought he'd found a lump.
Turned out it was just his phone in his back pocket.
But worrying time nonetheless.
[SIGHS]
Well, that went very well.
Surprisingly warm.
Our best chat yet.
I'm aware that our relationship has never been ideal.
ARTHUR:
Mm...
No, please.
Don't reproach yourself.
Yes, motherhood wasn't your forte but you did provide me with that lovable cloth monkey as a surrogate.
You know, sometimes I'm glad he's gone.
I'm gonna assume you mean Father and not Mr. Tickles.
So that he never had to see this.
In fairness, those two told me they were over 18.
And that they weren't men.
It's terrible the way you find out.
Who is this lovable rogue who's rough around the edges, but with stars in his eyes?
What forgivable antics.
Who could be anything other than charmed by this delightful individual?
- Congratulations.
- How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?
It's quite easy.
I don't consider it to be idiocy rather a savantish gift for defying death with fun.
That's your justification?
That's why you crashed a Batmobile?
Yes, it is.
Are we done?
Sit down.
When the sole heir of a corporation as big as ours gets arrested, it frightens investors.
The nonsense has to stop.
As the charming, coffee-colored gentleman who runs this country said the time has come to set aside childish things.
I don't think you can say "coffee-colored."
So I've arrived at a solution.
- Susan Johnson.
- Interesting.
Dresses well.
Borderline personality disorder.
How is that a solution?
You're going to marry her, Arthur.
- Why?
- Susan is a very impressive woman.
Lovely, yes.
She's certainly in control of that beast.
Capable woman, and quite willing to help poor people if there's a camera nearby.
Actually, if you want videos of Susan, you should come to my apartment.
- I've got one that'll knock your socks off.
- Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
With Susan as one of us investors will be comforted to know the line of succession doesn't end in a bottle.
When did you become so cynical?
Marriage isn't a tool to protect a corporate image.
It's to validate unwanted pregnancy.
If that's how you feel, Arthur, you give me no choice.
As of this moment, you are cut off.
What do you mean "cut off"?
Cut off from you and the?
You don't mean cut off from the?
The money, Arthur.
No.
I'm not gonna allow you to manipulate me, Vivienne.
I shall get married when I fall in love.
I respect your integrity.
You've just lost $950 million.
Actually, Susan is a very special girl, isn't she?
With that mouth, that velvety, beautiful mouth like a clown's mouth.
But not in a bad way.
Like a sexy clown.
And she'll make a wonderful wife.
Yeah.
I mean, who wouldn't wanna marry a sexy clown?
Congratulations, Vivienne.
You win.
I don't respect you, Arthur but I do applaud your talent for self-preservation.
Congratulations.
You're gonna be a wealthy man for the rest of your life.
That's all I've ever wanted to be.
The ring your father gave your mother, I believe.
[ARTHUR SIGHS]
It's like an ice rink for a mouse.
I don't like Susan.
Well, I don't like you very much and we've been happily stuck together for 30 years.
I know it's not perfect, but Susan is smart and capable and you need a woman like that to look after you.
I think I already have one of those.
In fact, do you want it?
Hobson, will you carry on being my nanny?
This is just my mother trying to control me.
Hey, Hobson, do you have the checkbook?
I wanna squander some wealth.
AUCTIONEER:
Ten thousand dollars for this item from the czar's collection.
Are we all done at 10,000?
Ten thousand dollars going once, going twice.
Twenty thousand dollars of money!
Twenty thousand dollars is the bid.
Thank you, sir.
Do I hear 30?
Do I hear 30,000?
[IN DEEP VOICE] Thirty thousand dollars, please.
AUCTIONEER:
Thirty thousand.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Thirty-five thousand.
[ALTERNATING VOICES] How dare you.
It's a challenge you want, is it?
Yeah, I want a challenge, plus I bid first.
That is irrelevant.
The highest number has supremacy.
You've clearly never been to an auction.
That's tit for tat.
That's exactly how the situation in the Middle East began.
You leave me no choice.
One hundred thousand dollars and one penny because you, sir, are a vile spendthrift.
Well, that's the first sensible thing you've said all day.
Sold to one of the Mr. Bachs for $100,000 and one penny.
- Thank you, sirs.
HOBSON:
Congratulations.
Hey, come on, Hobson.
You know I've always coveted the cutlery of Czar Nicholas II.
- Me too.
ARTHUR:
Oh.
Our last item up for bid today:
The suit in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address.
Let's start the bidding at 50,000.
Do I hear 50,000?
[IN DEEP VOICE] I'll take it.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] And the teleportation device in which it stands.
If you think this represents a victory over your mother's financial tyranny you're deluded.
- Thanks for the spoon, Arthur.
- Anytime.
Buy me a fork one day.
- Where's Bitterman with the car?
He said he was gonna be by the big gray thing.
- Where?
- He said the big gray sculpture thing with things on it.
It was like a riddle.
He can be very vague.
It's the blind leading the drunk.
ARTHUR:
Hobson, you find Bitterman while I wander off.
Wow.
What is this for?
Where's everyone going?
NAOMI:
This is actually not Grand Central Station, it's Grand Central Terminal.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
- No, no, I was static in a thoroughfare.
Uh, I'm lost.
Do you know where I can get a drink, please?
Um...
This is really all I have.
Good luck.
- Come on.
- Coins.
- I played with these when I was a boy.
NAOMI:
Let's keep going.
Time's a wasting.
Speaking of time the clock behind me is one of the most expensive clocks in the world.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
NAOMI:
Thousands of people pass through here every day and no one ever bothers to look up.
It's magical.
It's the only place in Manhattan where you can see the stars.
But it wasn't always that way...
Oh, you again.
If you look in the corner you can see one dirty brick and the whole ceiling used to be like that until it was renovated in 1998.
Wow, this is brilliant.
If you like ceilings, I've got a beautiful one above my bed.
[NAOMI SCOFFS]
That sounded cheeky.
I didn't mean that.
It lights up.
Thanks for that.
If you direct your attention to the opposite corner, you'll see a police officer.
- Miss, I warned you about this.
You don't have a tour license and now you're impeding foot traffic.
Come on, up, up, everybody up.
Officer, which law prevents this radiant stranger from finding the magical in the mundane?
- MTA Code 1085.1, Section 5.
- Could you be more specific?
OFFICER:
Hey.
Hey!
- Oh, there's a chase.
We're in a chase.
Sir, grab my Lincoln stick.
Chase!
My mind is racing.
My heart is pounding.
This is my first chase, and I love it.
- Let me through, I'm a free spirit!
OFFICER:
West on 42nd.
This is what I live for!
OFFICER:
We've got a runner.
ARTHUR:
A chase is happening!
This is a genuine chase!
Oh!
I'm...
I...
- No, no, no.
- I was gonna go get my license.
You ran from me, Naomi.
Now I gotta take you in.
Besides, you've had three warnings for operating an illegal tour.
Except this isn't an illegal tour because these people aren't tourists, they're our family.
Yes.
They are, they're my family.
That's my family.
We're having a family reunion.
Reunion.
Uh, that, for example, is Uncle Stuart waving there.
NAOMI:
Yes.
Oh, hey, Uncle Stuart.
Under that sun hat, that's Caribbean Diane Keaton.
- Yes, exactly.
- And also we have...
NAOMI:
Uncle Korean John Lennon.
And this is, uh, Abe Lincoln, I presume.
- Oh, no.
ARTHUR:
No.
- He is my admittedly eccentric...
- Fiancé.
I'm her fiancé.
He is my fiancé.
NAOMI:
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Darling, you don't want these people to think that you're some kind of random British pervert.
No, I'm a very specific British pervert, which is why you fell in love with me from our first date.
- Which was where, exactly?
Grand Central.
You had your first date at Grand Central Station.
It wasn't a shabby affair.
I'd hired out the entire place.
It was deserted.
Acrobats were in the place, put on quite a show for us.
- Didn't they, Naomi?
- No, no.
The floor was strewn with a million petals.
Their scent hung in the air like the sweet breath of angels.
And we forgot ourselves entirely.
Didn't we?
And ran nude through that concourse.
No, no, we just...
We had clothes on and we ate.
- What'd you eat?
NAOMI:
Oh.
Oh, what was that?
NAOMI:
Pe...
ARTHUR:
Pe...
Pe...
Pe...
[BOTH] PEZ.
Have any identification, Mr. Lincoln?
ARTHUR:
Actually, I do.
Um, here you go.
I think you'll find that should do the trick.
There's plenty more where that came from, if you catch my drift, hmm?
Ah.
You keep it, Arthur, and thank you for the show.
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
- Naomi, get a license.
Good luck.
NAOMI:
Okay.
What was that?
Who are you?
I'm just a ragged-trousered stranger with a crazy hat.
Oh, my God.
Arthur, your safari into the pointless ends now.
Get in the car.
No.
It's okay.
Uh, Hobson can't tell me what to do.
Yes, I can.
I work for his mother.
Get in the car.
Bitterman, open the door.
ARTHUR:
Bitterman, close that door.
- Get in the car.
- Not you, Bitterman.
ARTHUR:
Yes, you, Bitterman.
I'm sorry.
Who are you people?
I'm his nanny.
I'm not, I'm Bitterman.
Well, I have to get back to our confused family over there, so have a nice day.
ARTHUR:
Oh, hang...
Uh, excuse me.
Naomi Quinn, I'd like to see you again.
- I don't date boys who have nannies.
HOBSON:
Very wise choice.
You're not the first woman who walks the streets for a living that he's taken a liking to.
Is she always with you?
Okay. 917-176-2030.
- Uh...
Did you remember that?
- No.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUDING]
Arthur, get in the car.
I'm gonna get in the car now, but because I want to, not because you have told me to.
Distinction.
Bitterman.
ARTHUR:
It was magical.
We ran from the police, then we lied to them.
- Have you ever had days like that, Evander?
EVANDER:
I believe I have.
Me and this girl are two perfectly matched opponents, like you and Mike Tyson.
- She could be the one.
ARTHUR:
Yes.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
That went right through your guard.
- Are you okay?
- I'll make it.
What I like about her, Naomi is she's got a very unique way of seeing the world.
So do flies.
This is a repeat of when you were certain you needed a pet giraffe to be happy.
- Well, you were bored after a week.
- Because he ate his monocle.
The brute had no regard for fashion, Evander.
No, because you were from two different worlds, the same as this girl.
Listen, could you just let me focus on my jab and refresh me, please?
- Aah!
That's vodka in there.
- Refreshed?
No, but I think some of it probably went in my bloodstream so it's not all bad news.
- Get dressed.
- Why?
Because at 3:00 you're going to ask Burt Johnson for his daughter's hand in marriage.
I will do no such thing.
I'm going to remain here and box with Evander.
And then I shall have my music lesson with Kanye West as planned.
Out, now.
Make me.
I'll just have a bit of fun with her.
Use the old rope-a-dope, I should think.
- Stick and move, like you taught me.
- Arthur, after you're married you're going to have to stop this obsession with random women.
She is not a random woman, she understands me.
She laughs at my jokes.
She's like you, but with a more appropriate potential for sex.
[ARTHUR YELLS]
Ow!
That really hurt.
Evander, you assured me I was indestructible.
Burt Johnson, 3:00.
Evander, if he's not out of this ring in one minute, I'll bite your other ear off.
What am I doing here, Bitterman?
Uh, you asked me to drive you to the Burt Johnson Tower.
- But if you were me...
- I would like that very much.
That's very flattering.
But if you were me and you were in this situation what would you do?
What should I say?
Uh, I'd go in there and say, um, "Mr. Johnson, I like your tower.
But I love your daughter."
- But I don't love his daughter.
- Don't say that, because then he'll say no.
You've been very helpful.
Put this on.
Wait here.
It's the same as your one.
"BJ," I'll never get tired of that.
[DOOR CLOSES]
[LOCK CLICKS]
Woo-hoo, Bitterman!
[AIR HISSES]
Bloody hell.
It's an apocalyptic future.
The Upper East Side lay in absolute ruin.
The machines have taken over, as usual.
Ah, malevolent toaster.
Only one man can save civilization.
And that man is Arthur Bach.
Justice!
Hello, Arthur.
- Uh, sorry, I've never used...
- Never used what, Arthur?
One of these guns what makes nails come out of it.
Oh, the Grip-Rite GR 350.
It's a good gun.
It's lovely, isn't it?
It's also one of my favorites.
Do you know you've got nails sticking in you?
Framing nails.
Standard.
Well, I love what you've done with the place, Burt.
It reminds me of a gay club I went to once in Copenhagen.
This is gonna be my new office.
Oh, my God.
I live right over there.
I can see my living room, Burt.
That's interesting.
And frightening.
Did you put this building here just so you can spy on me?
BURT:
Mm-hm.
Shouldn't you be getting to the hospital?
If I ran off to the hospital every time I got a little boo-boo...
Yeah.
What's a nail through the body?
Made a hero out of Jesus.
Uh, Burt, I'm starting to feel a bit queasy.
Let's cut the bullshit, Arthur.
I'm from Pittsburgh and now I own skyscrapers.
Unlike you, I wasn't given my billions.
I took them.
But you know I'm actually fine with my little girl marrying you.
Do you know why?
Because you've lost a lot of blood and you're disoriented?
My little Susan can turn you around.
You know, she once bought a crack house and turned it into a condo.
That's funny, I once did the exact opposite.
Now, you listen to me carefully.
I need to trust that you'll do what she says.
- Yes.
- Table saw.
[WHIRRING]
Most dangerous piece of equipment on a job site.
Hands five inches on either side of the blade and you'll be fine.
- No, I don't like things like this.
- Come on.
You can do it.
No...
Just, uh...
Just push it through.
I did it, Burt!
I did a man thing!
That was incredible.
- Let's saw something else in half.
- How about your finger?
My finger?
It's okay, the saw has a safety device.
It detects moisture.
Anything containing moisture touches that blade, and bam, it'll stop.
That sounds a little bit risky to me, Burt.
Use your tongue.
- My tongue?
- Plenty of moisture in your tongue.
Oh, no.
I don't think I should do that, Burt.
I think I'd like to go back over there now to house.
- No, Burt!
What are you doing?
- Lick the saw!
No, Burt.
You've taken leave of your senses.
You need to stick out your tongue or it won't sense the moisture.
[ARTHUR YELLS]
I want my nanny.
Mr. Johnson, a very wise man once said:
"I like your tower, but I love your daughter."
Can I marry her, please?
Sure.
[GULPS]
SUSAN:
Pascal, I'm gonna have the veal.
WAITER:
Excellent choice.
Could you tell Jerome, please, that it was a little dry last time?
WAITER:
I will see to it.
- Thank you.
WAITER:
For you, sir?
- Just a caldron of tequila and a spoon.
I hear you have something to ask me.
Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact, Susan.
Would you mind telling me what the bloody hell's been going on?
We're having a magical night.
I don't understand.
You don't understand that there's a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage.
Susan, we...
- "Loveless marriage."
- We should not get married.
We don't have anything in common, do we?
I mean, we don't like the same food.
Veal?
I think that's really cruel.
Do you like it because it's cruel?
We don't like the same people, music.
You love horses.
- I do.
ARTHUR:
I don't trust them.
SUSAN:
Think about this.
- Their eyes, their sneaky feet.
- This is a business...
Stay with me.
- Their shoes are permanent.
SUSAN:
All you have to do...
- Who makes that commitment to a shoe?
- Most marriages devolve eventually.
- Mean faces.
[MIMICS HORSE WHINNYING]
This is all it is, it's a business partnership.
With the added benefit of attraction.
Undeniably, you have got something dark and twisted in you.
And for awhile, I thought I might be able to bugger it out.
But I tried really hard and I think it's still in there.
Reach into your pocket, pull out the ring, and say four little words.
Okay.
Uh, I don't love you.
Try again.
I like other girls.
- Oh, well, me too.
Let's invite one over.
- I'll embarrass you.
Daily.
For example, look, I'm quite capable of this kind of conduct.
I've seen it before.
[GARGLES]
SUSAN:
All right.
Yes.
That's just part of my repertoire.
By thunder, here's a pretty dame.
[WOMAN GRUNTS]
[PATRONS GASP]
There.
Hmm?
What do you think about that?
She's probably pregnant.
- Well done.
Go on.
- Okay.
Where's the kitchen?
I'm going to the kitchen.
- Coming in the kitchen.
- Isn't he mad?
[CLANKING]
I'm a naughty robot.
- But I just love him.
ARTHUR:
I've got tin titties.
This is what you're doing to me.
This is how I feel.
[CLEARS THROAT]
ARTHUR:
I think this sausage is cooked.
- Pascal, drinks, for everyone.
I'll tell you what, it's a lot more fun in that bloody kitchen.
Daddy did, uh, show you his little table saw, didn't he?
Turn around and tell everyone you're crazy when you're in love.
Ready?
Go.
I don't know why I did all of those things just then.
I go crazy when I'm in love.
[LAUGHING]
[WHISPERS] Sit down.
Great.
[WHISPERS] Help me.
Help me.
Embarrassing me or your family is the one thing that will not be tolerated.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, please.
Sweet boy, this can all be a ton of fun if you let it.
Shall we try again?
On one knee.
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.
Just go ahead.
ARTHUR:
Susan.
Pfft.
- Are you sure about this?
- You're running from yourself, Arthur.
I wish I was, because I'd let me get away.
Ask me.
Ask me.
Have it.
Go on.
Yes, Arthur.
Madames et monsieurs, the happy couple.
[APPLAUDING]
Ah!
Aspirin.
Give me the whole bottle.
My life's over.
You're gonna be looked after and you're gonna stay fabulously rich.
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor.
Some poor people I see look really happy.
That's because they're far away or you've given them money.
What do you know, Alfred?
Arthur, poor people have to work.
They have to stand in the rain waiting for buses to take them to things called jobs which they have to do all year round for holidays away from those jobs.
Don't patronize me, Snobson.
I know what a jobs are.
I model riding boots, don't I?
Posing in riding boots for another pampered prick is not a job.
Now take your vitamin.
- I erased her number.
- Hobson, I have to see her.
We'll unravel this engagement bollocks later.
Arthur, you made the choice.
An engagement is a promise.
Be a man.
[SPITS]
NAOMI:
Continuing on, this is Grand Central Terminal and it is home to more than 750,000 commuters a day.
Boring.
What a tiresome fact that was.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic New York architectural feature:
The man who takes your number and then never calls you.
Ooh.
- I'm bored too.
- Yeah, he's bored, I'm bored the whole tour is really bored.
Come on, liven it up, lady.
Okay, well, what about this:
See that clock up there?
See those statues?
That's Jupiter and Minerva and Hercules.
When the clock strikes 12, they reach down and they stop time.
And then they go out on the town.
They go swim in the Hudson and cavort at the zoo.
- Sometimes they even go to a strip club.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, guys, that's the end of your tour.
Um...
Your complimentary pretzel awaits.
It's only $5.
[CHUCKLES]
- Wow, you look really, really amazing.
- Okay.
- I've got something to show you.
- I don't...
We're on a tight schedule.
Come.
- Okay.
- Stop thinking.
Um, Arthur, there are no people.
Where are the people?
The people have been rerouted for 45 minutes by me for you.
It's sort of romantic, but in another way, it's incredibly selfish of you.
Grand Central.
Rose petals.
Dinner.
Oh, my God.
This is our first date.
Oh, is that what we said to the police officer?
I'd quite forgotten.
NAOMI:
Wait, I'm not getting naked.
Don't rule it out at this stage, it takes some of the pizzazz out of the evening.
It's like we're the last people on the planet.
Wow, this is amazing.
Thank you.
- There's a waiter on that escalator.
- Shh.
NAOMI:
He's in formal attire.
- He's carrying a platter.
- Wait for it.
Excellent.
- Your dinner, madam.
NAOMI:
Thank you.
PEZ.
These are us as PEZ heads?
Ha, ha.
You're the cute one.
Well, the cuter one.
NAOMI:
Do you want me?
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, you know, as soon as I saw you I knew I wanted to eat candy bricks out of your neck hole.
You're not the first.
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Well, on my last date the guy told me that I could only eat salad and then he said he was gay.
- This is better.
ARTHUR:
Yeah.
I mean, I'm heterosexual, so...
Oh, already winning.
[LAUGHS]
Did you know that the zodiac is painted on backwards?
It was a goof by the artist, but then the Vanderbilts, who commissioned the place said that it was God's view of the heavens.
Trust the Vanderbilts to see the world from God's perspective.
[SOFT CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]
There's a woman jumping behind you.
Oh, yeah.
I promised you acrobats.
[NAOMI LAUGHS]
NAOMI:
Arthur, this is...
This is insane.
Yeah, this is what money is for.
Creating excitement and joy and acrobats and PEZ heads and...
Italy.
- What?
- Let's go to Italy.
Okay, let's go.
When do you wanna go to Italy?
- Tonight.
I'll charter a jet.
Giuseppe, hi.
- I can't go to Italy with you tonight.
Excuse me.
- Naomi...
- Mm-hm?
...I'm talking about Tuscany.
White truffle gelato.
Have you ever tasted white truffle gelato?
It makes all other gelato taste like shit.
Arthur, you emptied out Grand Central Station.
Can't you just be here?
Can I show you something?
NAOMI:
After we moved to New York when I was 11 my mom used to bring me down here all the time.
We'd take the train in from Queens.
This is the Whisper Wall.
It's a really special place.
Okay, you have to go in that corner, and I'll be over here.
And say something.
What?
I don't know, anything.
Oh, you could call me up and ask me out, like you failed to do.
Good idea.
[MIMICS PHONE RINGING]
Hello, this is Arthur.
Is Naomi there, please?
Yes, this is Naomi.
My God, that's amazing.
You're over there, but I can hear you perfectly over here.
- It's acoustics.
- Wow.
I'm gonna buy one of these.
You don't have to buy it, it's free.
Incredible.
I was just having a phone call, so I've gotta go back.
Oh.
If you're, um, not too busy, would you like to maybe go on a date with me?
[CHUCKLES]
NAOMI:
Actually, I'm free right now if you'd like to do something simple.
Food, my house?
[CHUCKLES]
What is this, please?
- Oh, this is, um, generic brand Saucy-Os.
- Saucy-Os.
Yeah.
It's one of the few times the generic brand's actually better than the real thing.
Something happens in the factory.
It's delicious.
Welcome to the life of humans.
It is the culinary success of the season.
[GLASS CLINKS]
- Mademoiselle, you are...
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
ARTHUR:
What?
- My dad is asleep.
But your mum wears earplugs, so we don't need to worry about her.
My mom doesn't wear anything anymore.
Naked.
Sleeping au naturel.
She's dead.
I'm so sorry.
She died, um, last year.
It's really recent, and I made a joke about your dead nude mum.
I'm so sorry, Naomi.
- No, no, no, really, it's okay.
- I'm always doing things like that.
If it's any consolation, my dad is similarly deceased.
I'm so sorry.
Was that recent?
No, it was when I was a child, so you've won that round, but, uh...
- Point, Naomi.
- Right, well done.
You're winning, but it's not too late for me to run home and butcher my mother just to edge into the lead.
Uh, no.
My dad died when I was a kid.
He was by all accounts a very sensible, uh, frugal man who didn't drink, didn't smoke, walked everywhere.
NAOMI:
Hmm.
Dropped dead of a heart attack when he was 44.
Lesson being, why bother taking care of yourself?
- Cheers.
- I don't think that's the lesson.
- It's the lesson I learned.
- Cheers.
ARTHUR:
Mm.
[HUMS]
Ah.
No, thanks.
What were you like as a kid?
Well, ha, ha, aside from being grief-stricken...
- Ha, ha, yes.
- I was kind of little and I didn't drink so much then.
What about you?
Did you drink much as a child?
Strictly juice boxes.
- What a weirdo.
- I was a weirdo.
I thought that the moon followed me everywhere.
I thought it meant something special was gonna happen.
Well, that's a pretty ridiculous hypotheses, Naomi because by that notion, the moon would be out there right n...
[CHUCKLES]
Naomi, the moon is literally out there right now spying on us his light shining down on your face and clutter.
What is all these things?
[MUMBLES]
- My dad's pills.
- Hmm.
Got a lot of incriminating stuff lying around in here young la...
What's this for?
- That's nothing.
That's...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is not nothing.
This is something.
I used to write stories and draw pictures for kids.
Ah.
Wow.
"The Statue of Liberty had traveled all the way from France.
She missed her friend, the Eiffel Tower, and her arm hurt."
- Naomi, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.
In this, the Statue of Liberty is a lonely French giant.
Yeah.
And she stays lonely until she meets her friend, the Chrysler Building.
That's brilliant, Naomi.
You should quit your job and focus all your energy on this.
- I can't.
- Why?
What have you got to lose?
The house and electricity and...
You can pay for all those things when this is published.
Arthur, things like that don't happen to people like me.
Then why is the moon still following you?
[TRAIN PASSING NEARBY]
But this doesn't wake your father?
- He's used to this.
- This could wake my father.
From his grave.
[NAOMI LAUGHS]
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, lovely, but a little closer together.
SUSAN:
All right.
Smile, Daddy, smile.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, and now, I'd love to see some more love.
[SUSAN CHUCKLES]
What is this?
Your engagement photo for Town Country.
How about a couple of you and your mum?
Oh, all right, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
ARTHUR:
Vivienne?
VIVIENNE:
Yes, Arthur?
If hypothetically uh, I was to develop feelings for a woman who isn't exactly Susan kind of an un-Susan, an anti-Susan, as it were um, how would that make you feel, hypothetically?
Hypothetically, I'd say congratulations.
But unfortunately, the most magical relationships will wilt in the midst of grinding poverty.
Wonderful.
Arthur, how about a few of you and your future father-in-law?
- What?
No, no.
- Ha, ha.
Hello, Burt.
BURT:
Hello.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS]
I'll never get used to that handshake.
Where were you last night, Arthur?
What?
Just at home.
Home.
You sure about that?
- Yes.
- My turn, Daddy.
- Oh, Jesus.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Oh, great.
This is for the cover shot.
I need the bride and the groom, please.
Get on the horse, Arthur.
I love animals, but I don't trust you.
Get on the horse.
You will not make me cry today.
For the riding boot shoots, we use a stuffed horse or sometimes a girl.
- Maybe Daddy could help?
BURT:
Yeah, let me help.
- No, it's all right, Burt.
- Help him up.
ARTHUR:
You're a weak man, Burt.
Burt.
No, Burt, you're...
That doesn't help.
Ow!
Oh, my God.
Burt, you're not qualified.
Aah!
Ha, ha.
That was no trouble.
That was no tr...
What a lot of fuss.
What a lot of fuss about nothing.
Okay, lovely.
Who is she, Arthur?
I don't know, I imagine she's called Trixy or Rocket.
Something like that.
Not the horse.
The girl.
I don't know what you mean.
We'll be right back.
Excuse us.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
ARTHUR:
Wha...?
Aah!
I didn't agree to this.
First your father, now the horse.
When will my testicles get some rest?
Delaying a hundred commuter trains for a secret date wasn't the smartest move.
It was in The Times and the Post.
I must've hurt you with that.
I understand if you wanna cancel the wedding.
We're not gonna cancel the wedding.
It's happening as scheduled.
End of story.
Are those gonna be your vows?
"To death do us part, as scheduled"?
Listen, Susan, is this about money?
I've got news for you, you're already rich.
I'm not you rich, Arthur.
My family doesn't have a coat of arms.
I'll draw you one.
It's quite simple.
It's usually just a sword.
I hear them whisper at functions.
In their eyes, I'm just the daughter of a contractor from Pittsburgh.
They sneer when I walk past.
That's probably just because of who you are as a person.
[SCREAMS]
Bach Worldwide has been run by a Bach for generations.
Susan Johnson-Bach will be in control of one of the largest trusts in the world.
You're not gonna get in my way.
Say goodbye to your little girlfriend.
But Vivienne.
Susienne.
Satan.
Susan.
I like this girl.
We connect, she and I. She's spontaneous and...
I'm spontaneous.
Really?
You planned to confront me during a contrived photo shoot wearing an outfit you selected when you were a child.
Ow!
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, lovebirds, are you ready?
Don't forget, it's all about the eyes.
Those happy eyes.
You embarrassed me.
Embarrass me again and my father will cut off...
I know, my tongue.
No, your balls.
Not if I keep them moist.
Thoughts, Hobnobs?
I think you're engaged, and going out with Naomi is a really bad idea.
Exactly.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Which is why I've invited her here.
HOBSON:
Arthur, think.
I have thinked.
And that is why we're all gonna hang out together.
I've never hung out in my life.
I'm not gonna start tonight.
Hobson, if you get to know this girl, you're gonna love her.
Arthur, you must tell Naomi you're getting married.
You don't think that might rather mar the romance of the evening?
Hello, Arthur.
[YELLS]
- Hi, Hobson.
- Hello, Susan.
How nice to see you.
Can you just give us one little minute?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS]
ARTHUR:
Mm-mm.
- What was that?
- A French kiss.
Really?
Because the French always surrender.
That was decidedly German.
I was just at home feeling spontaneous.
I decided to put on a little something spontaneous and come over here spontaneously.
Susan, mentally ill people are spontaneous.
It's all about context.
[CELL PHONE BEEPING]
Oh, good, this is happening now.
Shall we go to the bedroom?
- You're a bit drunk.
- Okay.
So you just, uh...
You wait here.
Oh, no.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Oh-ho.
Lovely.
That's come off.
- Um, I'm gonna get ice.
- What do you have in mind?
Uh, I imagine there'll be some injuries.
It'll reduce the swelling.
Hurry.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Naomi, I'm very happy to see you.
- You are?
ARTHUR:
Um...
Naomi, I'm so glad you're here.
Um, did you kill Minnie Mouse or did she surrender her dress willingly?
If it makes you feel better, she didn't suffer.
Well, this is all very nice.
Come in, Naomi.
Come in.
Now, I know we were gonna have a night in...
- I can see why.
- But, actually, why don't we...?
- This is amazing.
- Uh, no.
Um...
- That fish looks like a cat.
ARTHUR:
Naomi.
No, it doesn't.
NAOMI:
Wow, bubblegum rocket.
- Don't look at that.
Now, tell me where the room filled with buckets of gold is.
It's over here, away from the bedroom, actually.
You have a glittery camel.
Why?
They're 10 a penny in England.
Ignore that.
Naomi, let me give you a full tour of the apartment while Arthur primps himself.
I'll be primping.
I've gotta primp.
NAOMI:
Oh, that's you.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah, Susan.
You're posing suggestively.
Do you like it, my fiancé?
Buckets of gold?
Broken lunar module.
Silly bugger drove it down the stairs.
Come through here.
This should keep your eyes off the valuables for a few minutes.
[CARTOONS PLAYING ON TV]
Get out.
Oh, I love Looney Tunes.
Are these always playing?
No, it, uh, alternates between this and historical documentaries.
- Really?
- No.
Just this.
Okay, I just have to get the perfect place.
Yes.
Your friend will be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Oh, wait, don't you wanna stay?
This is a really good one.
Pepé tries to kiss Penelope Pussycat, but then he falls off the boat.
You forgot to say "spoiler alert."
You are my peanut and I am your brittle.
- Ooh.
- I'm Susan Johnson, your fiancée.
[LAUGHS]
- That's the problem, actually.
- Come on.
No.
I'm getting up here, but this is not complicité.
- I'm just helping you to get dressed.
- Saving yourself for marriage?
More the divorce, to be honest.
[SUSAN GRUNTS]
Susan, my buttons.
[LAUGHS]
How much have you had to drink?
- Glasses?
Bottles.
Okay.
- Ha, ha.
We are now in an area of my expertise.
You are very drunk.
You need to sleep it off.
- Close that.
That's good.
Good.
Don't...
- Oh, that's...
That's nice.
- Try not to speak any words.
- Mm-hm.
[SUSAN MIMICS CAT]
Shh.
Shut up.
[MEOWS]
No, you're not a sexy cat.
You're not a sexy cat.
Stop that.
I'm a bad kitty.
You're not a bad kitty, you're a sleepy lunatic.
I'm a bad kitty.
I need to have my whiskers licked.
There are no circumstances under which I'd do that to a cat.
[LAUGHS]
ARTHUR:
Go to sleep.
That's enough of that.
Stop it.
Get...
Ow!
[MEOWS]
ARTHUR:
No!
Unh.
Ow!
[NAOMI CHUCKLES]
So this must be a fun job.
Yes, it has its moments.
Like trying to protect Arthur from people with dubious intentions.
NAOMI:
Hmm.
Oh, you mean me.
Because I'm totally after the money, if that's what you're thinking.
How is the illegal tour guide business going?
Feeds my dad.
But I'm actually writing a book.
A children's book.
It was Arthur's idea.
Well, make sure there are lots of pictures, otherwise he won't understand it.
I think Arthur understands more than you realize.
So, Hobson, are there any men in your life?
Are you attempting to make small talk with me?
I am attempting it.
Is it working?
- No, not really.
- Darn it.
So?
Any man I've ever met pales in comparison to the dazzling floor show that is Arthur's company.
[NAOMI CHUCKLES]
I know you were being sarcastic just then but it really is quite dazzling.
All is fair in love and war, eh, darling?
Do you think he's okay?
ARTHUR:
Ow!
Ow!
- Bad horse.
- Ow!
That's not erotic.
It just hurts.
No.
Susan.
Stop it.
You can't do that.
Horses and cats can't mate.
Our children will be monsters.
Hobson, it's not what it looks like.
Unless it looks like a cat raping a horse.
[LAUGHS]
[GRUNTS]
SUSAN:
Arthur.
- What's happening?
- Oh.
What has happened to me?
I think the problem is your clothes are made of metal and my bed is made of magnets.
- Oh, you think so?
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, stay calm, kitty.
I'm not a cat anymore.
I am a businesswoman.
I think I have a remote control.
Excuse me.
- Uh...
Ah, right.
I've got the remote.
- Get me off of here!
ARTHUR:
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm gonna...
Ah, got it.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, it's not that, obviously.
Uh, on the bright side, at least something in this room is attracted to you.
For the love of God.
Maybe this.
[YELLS]
- Oh, are you all right?
- Not that.
I'm not gonna press this anymore because if I press the wrong button, the bed could fall and kill you.
Which none of us would want.
None of us.
I've gotta go and get Hobson.
She knows how this works.
Oh, you are a useless man.
You can't do anything without that miserable old woman.
[SUSAN GRUNTS]
[DOOR OPENS]
There you are.
That was a lot of primping.
Oh, ha, yeah, yeah.
Primping.
Yeah, primping.
Yeah, it's primpalicious, though, isn't it?
The results.
He's a primpanzee.
Sorry about this noise.
I think it's, um...
It's the bloody neighbors.
- Neighbors?
- Well, I think I'll retire now.
Good night, Hobson.
Ahem.
Hobson.
Um, thank you for everything.
[WHISPERS] I did it for her.
I don't want that poor girl humiliated.
- You like her, don't you?
She's lovely.
- Just be a grown-up for once, Arthur.
Okay.
Oh, um, could you detach the half-naked businesswoman from under my bed?
Sorry.
Good night, Hobson.
Goodbye, Naomi.
NAOMI:
Not a bad back yard.
Yes, except whenever I sunbathe nude, I get the strangest looks.
Oh, you're that guy.
- Are you a bit chilly?
- Oh, yes.
- Would you like...?
- Thank you.
Ahem, here.
- Is this your father's? "Gerald Bach." ARTHUR:
It is.
Well, it was.
I had some of his suits re-tailored to fit me.
It seemed silly to throw them away.
ARTHUR:
Mm.
- Oh.
"Why bother taking care of yourself?"
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Just have fun.
- Well, you seem to have a lot of fun.
- It's my calling.
[NAOMI CHUCKLES]
I found a free thing to show you.
It's this way.
- Come with me.
Come on.
- Okay.
ARTHUR:
In my mind, this is the pond from a book I had when I was a kid called Frog and Toad Together.
I love Frog and Toad.
My mom used to read them to me all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My mom subcontracted that job to Hobson.
NAOMI:
There's a really sad one where Toad freaks out because he sees Frog sitting alone on a rock.
So he swims out to him with a picnic, but then it falls in the water.
[MIMICS TOAD] "Our lunch is spoiled.
I made it for you, Frog, so you'd be happy."
But Frog wasn't sad.
[IMITATES FROG] "When I woke up, I felt good because the sun was shining.
I felt good because I was a frog."
[IN NORMAL VOICE] And I felt good because I have you for a friend.
If you were sitting alone, I'd bring you a sandwich.
I'll sit alone, then.
HOBSON: "And Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon.
They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea.
They were two close friends sitting alone together."
[ARTHUR SIGHS]
I couldn't tell her, Hobson.
She's my Toad.
Oh, bollocks.
[SIGHS]
Listen, Arthur, I'm sure Naomi is a very nice girl but you can't live without the money.
How do you know?
Please.
You can't go half an hour without buying another sports car.
When I was little you used to say:
[MIMICS HOBSON] "Arthur, you can do anything under the sun."
I never spoke like that.
It was a bit like that.
That was before you paid Elton John $2 million to sing over the PA in a grocery store.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
- I think I could live without the money.
- Oh, yes?
How?
I'd get a job.
- Ha!
- What?
Fine.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Get a job.
I am a grown man and I shall join the mature world of gainful employment to prove it.
["TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR" PLAYING ON STEREO"]
Don't let that undermine what I just said.
[PHONES RINGING]
- Do you know how to use Excel?
- No.
- PowerPoint?
- No.
- Outlook.
- Generally positive.
You know, I mean I have down days like anyone, but...
MAN:
It's a program.
Oh, um, no.
Can you file?
- File?
MAN:
Yes.
In a?
No.
There must be something I can do.
[SIGHS]
MAN IN COSTUME:
Hey!
MANAGER:
And so, this is how you simply sign on and that unlocks the register.
Now, you clock in, employee number, password and the register's yours.
This, uh, might seem a bit much for my first day but could I inquire as to the possibility of a transfer to the costume-greeter department?
I think I'd thrive.
No.
Let's just start with the register for you.
I've got my own costume, if that helps.
Nope, doesn't really make a difference.
No.
Register.
So I've cleared it.
Go ahead and enter your employee number and log in.
[REGISTER BEEPS]
- Okay.
You just hit a lot of random keys.
- Well, that's what you did, in fairness.
[MANAGER CHUCKLES]
- It says "invalid key."
- Yes.
Invalid key.
That means that I need to reset this.
This may take a moment.
Would you mind just stepping right over...?
How did he get that job, exactly?
What is he, the owner?
The son of the owner?
- You can't do it, and you never will.
- Never?
That's harsh.
MANAGER:
I've entered your employee number and...
Oh.
Want some?
- I think you should take the day off.
- As a reward?
Tomorrow we'll find something more suitable for you.
I think what he's doing is derivative.
[NAOMI ARTHUR CHUCKLE]
Oh, the moon really is following me.
Would you stop going on about the moon following you?
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
ARTHUR:
He's lunar.
He's clearly a pervert.
[NAOMI CHUCKLES]
Arthur?
There've been some reports of staff members eating on the floor.
Do you know anything about that?
Um, no.
No, I don't know anything about that, Peter.
You know, I think it's not appropriate for you to be on the floor.
We should find something for you in the stock room.
Excuse me.
If I gave you $10,000 would you let me wear this costume for one hour?
Hello.
Welcome to the store.
May all your dreams come true.
Free candy!
Here you go, kids!
[LAUGHING]
I'm a lovely bear.
Grr.
[GIRLS SCREAM]
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm not a genuine bear.
ARTHUR:
Here, listen, you take this with you.
If you leave very quickly, security won't have an opportunity to ascertain you.
- Go.
Try not to look suspicious.
- Arthur?
- Hello.
- What are you doing?
Peter, I can explain everything.
[ARTHUR YELLS]
I've got one.
I'm okay.
MANAGER:
Arthur.
- May I have a word with you?
- Is that word "promotion"?
HOBSON:
One apocalyptic hangover, no job.
Congratulations, Arthur.
The employment market is a vortex.
Listen to this: "Aquarium needs help cleaning tanks.
Swim with the fishes."
That is a Mob threat.
None of these jobs make any sense at all.
"Systems integration professional."
Would anyone do it as an amateur?
Would anyone approach systems integration as a hobby for fun on a Saturday afternoon instead of flying a kite?
Who is integrating systems for their own amusement?
Hobson.
I think in order to do this I may have to be a little more sober.
[CHURCH BELL RINGING]
ARTHUR:
What do you think?
To, you know, preserve my anonymity.
You're right, it would be a shame to jeopardize such a distinguished public profile.
JAMES:
I stole from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's tricycle so I could score some junk.
- Jesus.
JAMES:
I was so drunk once I backed my car over my mother outside Walgreens.
Thirty-seven days sober.
[MURMURING]
JAMES:
But sometimes, it's just so hard.
Like I'm in this grave...
Whoa, this is depressing.
It's like unhappy hour.
- Shh.
- It is.
I don't like it in here.
This is making me want to drink more.
Sir, you need to wait till the end of the meeting.
Go on, James.
It's okay.
I'm done.
And you are?
My name is Gandalf.
ALL:
Hi, Gandalf.
Hello.
And I came here because I'd like to drink a bit less.
Not give it up altogether.
Maybe 5, 10 percent cut down.
Reasonable.
Look, I'm sorry.
No one's gonna convince me that my life isn't fun, okay?
And forgive my crassness but if I ran my mother over, I'd be out celebrating with booze.
Which is what I plan to do right now.
Cheerio.
Excuse me.
Hobson.
My name is Lillian and I'm an alcoholic.
ALL:
Hi, Lillian.
HOBSON:
Good afternoon.
I'm rich.
I'm fabulously rich.
I'm also generous and kindhearted.
My father died when I was young and my mother was absent most of the time.
Is this an excuse for making a mockery of my life?
Oh, sure, it all looks very wild from the outside.
Do you know, I once went to bed with three European princesses at the same time.
But, A, I can't remember anything about it and, B, apparently, I vomited on two of them before losing control of my bladder on the third.
Oh, yes, all such fun.
Until the fog parts, and suddenly there's a hole so big that all the vintage champagne and the Batmobiles in the world won't fill it.
And then?
Well, then, I'm all alone on my magnetic bed wondering what venereal disease I've just caught.
Always the quiet ones.
[WHISPERS] This is itchy.
That was really lovely what you said in there about me.
Now, if you could just do the drinking for me, I think we'd have this thing cracked.
ARTHUR:
Vivienne.
VIVIENNE [OVER PHONE]:
Yes?
Don't make me do this, please.
I'm not the one with a choice.
You can walk away any time you like.
There's a simple solution to all of this, Arthur.
Marry Susan and cheat with the nobody from Queens.
[RINGS]
[DOOR OPENS]
Hello, Naomi's dad.
Is your daughter here?
Her name is Naomi.
Just clear up any confusion.
It's a little late, but I wasn't sleeping myself.
Come in, come in.
Arthur?
Oh, hello, Naomi.
You may wanna sit down.
Or lay down.
Although I prefer you stayed awake, because this is important.
What is it?
I'm engaged to another Susan.
Woman.
Another Susan woman.
You're engaged?
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I meant to before.
You meant to tell me that you were engaged to another woman.
- I was gonna get Hobson to do it...
- Oh, my God.
Arthur.
- Who do you think you are?
- Naomi.
I'm not saying I think I'm Naomi.
You are.
Why else would you be wearing her pajamas.
I didn't mean for this to happen, but then I started falling for you.
And I thought, "Oh, no.
I'm falling for Naomi and I have to marry Susan woman or I'll lose the money."
Let me get this straight.
You don't wanna marry this woman.
- Susan woman.
- But you're going to because you're scared of losing the money?
- Yeah, see, I'm trapped by the money.
- Oh, you're trapped by the money.
Oh, okay.
Well, we should probably start a telethon.
And then people could call in and relieve you from this horrible money.
If you think it would help.
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi, please.
You're the most special person that I have ever...
- What, lied to?
I was gonna say "met."
Am I the most special person you ever made this for?
Who makes a PEZ dispenser of somebody's head when they're engaged to someone else?
Admittedly, we're a small demographic.
Stop joking.
Okay.
Let me run this up the flag pole.
What if I were to install a secret door?
It leads to an apartment.
And you live in that.
On the other side of that door, I'm married to Susan.
That's not ideal.
But on the bright side, I assure you it's entirely sexless.
What...?
Naomi, don't leave, Naomi.
This is my apartment, Arthur.
You have to leave.
This is for you.
For your dad.
For your writing career.
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand dollars.
- I thought a million would be vulgar.
- We don't want your money.
Could you leave?
Can I just stay here for a minute, please?
Why?
Because it will reduce the proportion of my life that I spend feeling utterly miserable.
Goodbye, Arthur.

What are you doing in my bathroom?
We discussed this.
Hobson left me in charge.
She went back to bed.
She had a headache.
- Hobson's got a headache?
- Yes, sir.
How did she say it?
What did she say?
"Bitterman, I'm going to bed.
I have a headache."
She sort of said it like that, all broken up and staccato?
Pretty much, sir.

There'll be no bears until you tell me what's the matter.

I'm traveling down this white tunnel.
There's a garden at the end.

Why is it so hot in here?
Stop being childish.
Sorry.
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
Will you sit down?
Listen there are three books.
Take them back to the library.
Oh, Hobson, please don't die anymore.
It's getting very boring.
What about you?
You look a bit lost today.
Naomi won't talk to me.
Oh, I am sorry.
It's a shame she wouldn't come to an agreement.
Little tart like that would've saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
How dare you talk about Naomi like that.
She's one of the finest people I know.
I employ you to support me.
I don't pay you to make snide comments about my friends.
Remember that.
You're just Mary Poppins with menopause.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Delightful to see you, Hobson.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Well, it's this marriage, Vivienne.
I'm very excited for Arthur.
I'm worried for him too.
Are you, now?
Look, he has attempted gainful employment and he even went to AA.
- It didn't last very long, but I have hopes...
- AA?
There's this girl.
I think she's inspiring him to...
- He's getting married.
- Yes, but is it right for him, Vivienne?
Arthur does have other issues.
And whose fault is that?
Well, I'm so sorry to have wasted your valuable time.
He needs this, Lillian, he's weak.
He's stronger than you think.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
NAOMI:
Who was that?
Um...
Hobson is in my house.
Surprisingly, I am.
Well, don't be intimidated by the space.
We don't use all the rooms.
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING]
You got that, McKenzie?
Thank you.
ARTHUR [SINGING]:
Why am I stuck here in this room?
I'm not the bride I'm the bloody groom
Isn't he charming?
[WOMEN LAUGH]
It's the sweetest thing.
Oh.
Oh, McKenzie, this is stunning.
ALL:
Ooh.
- No metal.
ARTHUR:
Very nice.
[SINGING] Just don't leave me for a minute
Or you'll come home and find me in it
[ALL LAUGH]
I just made that up.
That just came to me.
Here.
Oh.
Love these.
The grape shears.
Look, Arthur.
[SINGING] Grape shears, what an innovation
You can use them for my castration
[ALL LAUGHING]
Because she does that.
I've been...
I've been horribly emasculated.
HOBSON:
Arthur misses you desperately.
Has he asked you to go on a tour of all of the girls that he misses?
No, he's far too decent to be involved in anything as tawdry as this.
As what?
As my plea not to give up on him.
You really look after him, don't you?
Yes, I do.
And it's a job that I recommend highly.
A, um, taste of England.
Oh.
Oh, lovely.
As, I believe, you look after this gentleman.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but Arthur is getting married.
Naomi, if there's one thing an old woman can recognize it's a young man in love.
How's that tea?
Like sewage.
[CHUCKLES]
- I'm so sorry.
NAOMI:
Uh, are you okay?
Thank you.
Thanks, ladies, for such a lovely afternoon.
These are gorgeous.
- Arthur, hasn't it been...?
- Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.
And for the rest of my bloody life.
[CELL PHONE VIBRATING]
Hey.
Hello.
What?
HOBSON:
It's just a headache.
Hold on.
You've been having tests for months.
The doctor told me on the phone.
Oh, bother snaps.
Well, what do doctors know anyway?
I think they're usually really well qualified, Hobson.
Why didn't you mention this?
I'm sorry.
It's just I didn't want to worry you.
Well, now I am worried.
[DOOR OPENS]
[HOBSON LAUGHING]
But forget the worry and enjoy this extravagant gesture!
Look at those bears.
I love them.
- The biggest ones in the shop.
- Can I have one?
ARTHUR:
That's part of a display.
They didn't wanna sell that one.
Put this on, please.
I'm not putting that on.
Put it on or the bears will be incinerated.
[SIGHS]
Humiliating.
- You look really dignified.
HOBSON:
Mm.
[ARTHUR CLEARS THROAT]
[DEVICE BEEPS]
HOBSON [IN DARTH VADER VOICE]:
How much did you waste on this?
They're very reasonable, actually.
- Uh, so say, "Wash your winkie." HOBSON:
Wash your winkie.
[LAUGHS]
Say, "If you have to pay them, it's not love."
HOBSON:
If you have to pay, it's not love.
ARTHUR:
Ha!
You do one, you do one.
Could you do Sammy Davis, Jr?
ARTHUR:
Sammy Davis, Jr.
Is not to do with that costume.
- I like Sammy.
- What's the point in that?
I see you've decided not to grow up.
Yeah, I already decided not to bother.
- Where's Naomi?
- Outside.
Do you wanna see her?
You see her for me, will you?
[WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PA]
How is she?
All she'll tell me is she's got a headache.
No one else will tell me anything because we're not family.
- That's hospitals.
Why was she at your house?
Hobson and I hang out all the time.
We go shoplifting every Wednesday.
Bergdorf's.
That's a good time to do it.
Hardly any security.
She was worried about you.
Hey, how's the writing going?
It's really good, actually.
I sold my book.
Congratulations, that's such fantastic news.
You deserve that.
When you found out, did you do a scream?
I did.
I went:
[ARTHUR CHUCKLES]
- Only louder.
ARTHUR:
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, a scream is defined by its vocal quality to some degree.
I've been really angry at you.
And I've been rehearsing in my head what I was gonna say to you if I saw you again.
And it was gonna start with, "Hi, Arthur."
That's conventional.
And then I was gonna get into a lot of really mean stuff.
And it was gonna be directed at you in a very pointed way because you lied to me.
But then I would run out of steam eventually and I'd say, begrudgingly:
"Thank you for encouraging me with my writing."
And then I would get very serious and I'd look at you in the eyes and I would say:
"Arthur you have a problem."
I'm glad that was hypothetical because that would be really hard to hear.
How is Hobson?
ARTHUR:
Ah.
Well...
Naomi, this is Susan my fiancée.
And, uh, Susan, this is Naomi.
It's nice to finally meet you.
That is like a medium-size ice rink.
And ice rink.
That's what I said, but I said for mice.
Because it's small.
- You're a tour guide, right?
NAOMI:
Yep.
Well, actually, Susan, Naomi's a writer.
She's being published.
Oh, well, congratulations.
Who's gonna publish your book?
- Doesn't matter, does it?
- Uh, Painted Wagon Press.
- They're all the same.
- Ha, ha, Painted Wagon Press.
That name sounds familiar.
Sorry, I can't think of...
Why might that name sound so familiar to me?
Can you help me with that?
Why I might know that name?
No, Susan, I can't.
Oh.
It's coming to me.
Bach Worldwide just acquired them.
You should've come to me about that.
I could've made you a better deal.
But why would you buy them?
So you could tell them to publish my book.
Thank you.
What'd you do that for?
I just did her a favor.
Naomi, wait.
Wait.
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again, and I think you're talented...
I thought other people thought that I was talented.
I thought that I had earned it.
I thought that I had earned it.
And that felt really good.
I like that.
I like earning something.
And I know that you don't know what that feels like, but it's great.
You should try it sometime.
ARTHUR:
Ow, ow, ow.
I cut my hand.
There's blood in those.
Actually, um, don't eat them because of the blood.
[CRASHING]
Hobson, how does this bag of tea work?
Do you tear the top off or you use this to cut in?
How?
No, you put the whole bag in the pot.
- Just put the whole bag in?
- Mm.
With water.
Hot water.
- Brilliant.
- But not out of the tap.
- From a...?
- Kettle.
Brilliant.
Perfect.
[CLANGING]
[BELL RINGS]
Be careful of that plate.
It's gonna be very, very...
[CRASHING]
ARTHUR:
Oh, God, no!
- Hot.
I think I was better off in the hospital.
Bon appétit.
Actually, my medication makes me sufficiently nauseous.
You're forever pestering me about change and you're afraid to eat a little bowl of spaghetti circles.
Come along.
Please let me look after you.
Quite nice.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's not unpleasant, is it?
- Well, it is unpleasant...
- Ha.
...but it's quite nice.
I'm a genius in there.
NARRATOR [ON TV]:
Mother bear will care for her cubs for up to two years.
Lovely.
HOBSON:
Come on, come on, come on.
- No.
Not like this.
- Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
You've got so much to give.
Have you called her, Arthur?
No.
Have you ever been in love, Hobson?
Yes, I was once.
Yes, in London.
He was from Spain.
He asked me to go there with him.
You were nearly 3.
What happened?
Two days before I was due to leave...
I had my bags all packed.
- Your father died.
You should've gone.
I would've understood.
[HOBSON SCOFFS]
It was too late.
I loved you.
Why have you never told me?
I didn't want you to feel bad.
- Why are you telling me now?
- I want you to feel bad.
So this is what it's like to go to bed at 9:00.
HOBSON:
Yes.
Isn't it wicked?
[GRUNTS]
Hmm, Hobson.
I had a bad dream.
Hobson?
Hobson, stop mucking about.
You can't see a tunnel of light and red pitchfork.
I'm not gonna take those three books back to the library.
Hobson?
Nurse!
Nurse!
Bitterman?
We're gonna have a party.
I'm tired of being sad now.
Bitterman, what are you doing?
BITTERMAN:
I'm trying to cheer you up, Mr. Bach.
Is it working?
Not yet.
How about now?
You have to do something funny.
You can't just stand there.
- Just say something incongruous or pithy.
- Okay.
Today's your wedding day, Mr. Bach.
Well, that's it.
I'm gonna drown myself.
Mr. Bach?
Mr. Bach?
Where'd you go?
[ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING]
Lovely to see you.
Hello.
Chancellor.
- I am so delighted you're here.
- Oh, thank you.
I think you'll be very, very pleasantly surprised.
Enjoy yourself.
[WHISPERS] The groom is here.
Ah.
I gather the groom has arrived.
ARTHUR:
Bitterman.
Bitterman.
Please.
I'm getting married today.
But you were in there too long.
- Oh, God.
She's here.
- You're late.
Was I not clear?
Don't...
Don't...
Don't blame Bitterman.
He had a hell of a struggle getting me out of the bath.
Coffee.
Now.
Good idea.
I'll have one too.
[WHISPERS] I'm a bit drunk.
[WHISPERS] Okay.
The good news is you're here and you're not wearing a cape.
Proud day for you, Viv?
[SIGHS]
I have guests to attend to.
Stay.
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]
Psst.
[WHISPERING] Small person.
Can you read?
For, like, four years.
Can you?
Not at the moment, no.
Help.
Come here.
I need you to read this for me.
Okay.
"My dearest Arthur.
Listen up, you pampered prick."
Carry on.
BOY:
"You now know where the tea bags are.
To operate kettle, press red button.
Milk in refrigerator.
That's the big box with the pretty light that comes on when you open the door.
It's not too late, Arthur.
You can do anything under the sun.
All my deepest, fondest love.
I'm smiling down at you.
Or, more likely, up at you.
Forever and ever, H."
[DOOR OPENS]
Are you crying?
That's a bride's job, to cry.
It's time to man up, Arthur.
[MENDELSSOHN'S "WEDDING MARCH" PLAYING ON ORGAN]
[CRACKING]
MINISTER:
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join Arthur and Susan in matrimony.
Which is commended to be honorable among all men.
And therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently, discreetly and solemnly.
Seems like a lot of adverbs.
That seem like a lot of adverbs to you?
Shh, Arthur.
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together let him speak now or forever hold his peace.
[CHUCKLES]
I object!
[ALL GASP]
ARTHUR:
To this wedding.
- Arthur, you can't object.
It's your wedding.
Is it my wedding?
Because I think if it was, I'd know who all these people were.
I mean, who are you?
- I'm your best man.
- I've never seen you befor...
- Actually, have I?
I recognize you a bit.
- I'm your mother's receptionist.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's nice to see you.
But what about you two?
Who's Abercrombie and who's Fitch?
And was there a bachelor party?
I wasn't invited.
If there was, then I don't think I'd have enjoyed it.
You look like squares.
And I've slept with three of them.
Not sure which three.
I just...
Statistically...
Susan, this isn't real.
This wedding is a sham.
It's a wonderful sham wedding, but it's a sham.
We don't love each other.
Even you deserve better than this.
In fact, it was Abraham Lincoln who said, "Freedom..."
[ALL GASP]
That's my little girl.
- You will marry me.
- No, Susan.
Abercrombie.
Fitch.
I am the future of this company, and all I need is your goddamn last name.
[MURMURING]
- Hit him in the face.
- No.
Stop.
Don't touch my son.
But Vivienne.
I think you've said enough.
Arthur, come here.
[ARTHUR CLEARS THROAT]
Are you certain about this?
Yes, I am.
It means giving up everything.
I'm happy to give up everything.
In fact, Vivienne, I can start giving up everything right now.
This, for example.
Don't need that where I'm going.
Blue-collar district.
This will look sarcastic.
I feel like I'm bound up like a little Japanese girl's foot.
I don't want that on anymore.
Shackles, chaining me to wealth.
Bloody thing.
Ugh.
This shirt, itchy.
I don't want it anymore.
I can assure all of you that after this I will be nowhere near the Bach fund.
So your investments are on solid footing.
[ARTHUR GRUNTS AND GUESTS CHATTER]
Excuse me.
Don't let that detract from what I just said.
And finally...
[GUESTS GASP]
Actually, um, these were a Christmas present from Hobson.
I...
I think I'll hang onto them.
- I'm keeping this ring.
I'm keeping this ring.
- Yes.
ARTHUR:
Okay, well, uh, I'm going to be poor now.
So how'd it go?
Well, um, I'm very sorry, Bitterman, but I'm afraid you're out of a job.
Congratulations.
- Is there anywhere I could take you, sir?
- Well, that's very sweet but I've gotta get used to fending for myself now.
Could you hail me a cab, please?
[WHISTLES]
VIVIENNE:
Arthur.
[VIVIENNE SIGHS]
- Once again, you've humiliated me.
- Sorry.
But this time, I respect you for it.
You're stronger than I thought.
And you've shown me the truth about Susan.
Yeah, she's bloody evil, isn't she?
Oh.
- For the cab.
- Oh.
Good luck in your life, Arthur.
A bit awkward.
ARTHUR:
We've got to get to Queens.
Do you know Queens?
It's full of traffic, isn't it?
Do you know Naomi?
Mazel tov, I'm looking for Naomi.
Naomi!
What?
ARTHUR:
Hello.
I remembered.
I remembered the bricks and the train.
I came in a taxi.
- You're wasted, Arthur.
ARTHUR:
No!
Well, yes.
But that was only so I could get married.
- Oh, okay.
- Naomi!
I didn't go through with it.
Instead, I did the only rational thing, and I gave away all of my clothes.
Do you remember one word of the last conversation we had, Arthur?
- Yeah, we were going to build a secret door.
- No.
The other conversation.
I gave away billions of money for you.
You shouldn't have done that.
Naomi?
My mum's dead.
I know.
And I am so...
I'm so, so sorry.
But I can't be her replacement.
Okay.
ARTHUR:
I used to have in my apartment a rather large, incredibly decadent magnetic bed.
Thought "This bed is gonna make me truly happy."
This is the one thing that my life requires, is a floating magnetic bed.
When I get that, I'll be happy.
And my companion that evening was, um...
What's a euphemistic way to say it that doesn't sound unpleasant?
Um...
A prostitute.
And...
[ALL LAUGH]
We tried to prize open the door of the fish tank because we thought we could make a phone call.
Broke the door off of the fish tank.
The fish came flooding out.
I nearly drowned.
[ALL LAUGH]
It wasn't without its amusing moments, but it took a spiritual toll on me and none of these phone boxes, nor magnetic beds could fill the hole within me.
I spent a lot of my life embarrassing my family and people that care about me.
But I've made amends with my mother now.
As much as you can with a dragon.
I'm six months clean today.
[ALL APPLAUD]
Congratulations.
I think this is the most I've ever valued a coin.
MAN:
Next.
Next in line, please.
That's 12.50.
NAOMI:
Lady Liberty wrapped her giant green arms around the Chrysler Building one last time.
And then she carefully walked back to her own island.
Even though they'll always live apart they'll still stand a little taller and shine a little brighter because they shared an adventure.
The end.
It's question time.
Does anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Does anybody mind if I tell another story?
- I mind.
- Me too.
You sound like Harry Potter.
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing?
He's a great wizard.
Listen, it's quite a good story, and if no one here minds...
Uh, excuse me, sorry.
- I'd really like the opportunity to tell it.
If that's okay, um...
Once upon a time, there was a prince.
Handsome, he was.
He fell in love with a princess from Queens.
- Are you a girl or a boy?
- Doesn't matter.
The fact is, he loved this princess so much that he was prepared to give up his kingdom for her but she turned him away.
- What a bitch.
- She was not.
Why would you say that?
She did the right thing, it turns out because this prince had a little bit of a problem with candy.
He couldn't get enough candy.
- Do you mean drugs?
ARTHUR:
No.
No.
Where did you grow up?
GIRL:
Meth?
- No.
BOY:
Crack?
- No.
It was just booze.
Look, this isn't working.
Okay.
[SIGHS]
What I came here to say to you, Naomi, is that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
And I'm sorry that I asked you to take care of me when what I want more than anything in the world is to take care of you.
And I think that's the end of the story.
CHILDREN:
Ew!
Hey, what's wrong with you?
This is just two adults kissing in a room full of children.
[NAOMI CHUCKLES]
So how's the real world treating you?
Oh, I've learned mostly that I should just try and live simply now.
- It's better for me.
- What is this?
Bitterman!
Why?
You said, "This is the girl I can buy back with a fleet of movie cars."
I said this is a girl I can't buy back with a fleet of movie cars.
- Oh.
- Specifically, I said "can't."
Get rid of...
Just get rid of them.
It's embarrassing.
- So I guess your mother forgave you.
- Yeah, yeah, you know.
I got my inheritance in return for running the Bach charity discreetly.
Should we just take the subway?
Which one's the fastest?
[TIRES SCREECH]
ARTHUR:
Through the park, please, Bitterman.
[SIRENS WAILING]
carrot was here
So, the elusive little gadget finally shows up.
It's your turn Quijada.
How do you plan to get us out of Chile?
On the "Balcarce".
A yacht that'll take you to Guacho, Peru.
The Spaniard's sending us on a vacation?
I don't believe you.
Sounds good, Tegui.
But I need guarantees.
We need passports in Peru, and to travel to Brazil.
Do I look like a customs officer to you?
You'll have to get them on your own, kid.
Your mom isn't here to wipe your ass anymore.
I can't wait to get my hands on you.
Well then you're screwed.
Becuase I don't do faggots.
I'll be in the warehouse.
The warehouse?
I think I'll find something.
Vicente, I want a passport too.
No way in hell.
I'm not taking her with me.
- Don't worry.
- She's nuts.
She's staying here.
- Tegui.
- Go get some rest.
Get in back there.
Clear.
- Clear.
- Clear
CHILEAN BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
What are you doing with my stuff?
I'm giving you this.
It's all I've got.
Ximena will get your granddads' money.
I'll only use it to go look for you in Brazil.
You'll use your granddads' money to graduate from college and move on.
Can't you see if you don't take me with you,
I'll come looking for you?
Irma, you're not coming with us.
What?
Nobody deserves so much misery.
That's all.
This belonged to your dad.
I took it off of him at the cemetery.
It'll help you remember your dad who only wanted to save you from this mess.
He won't say a word.
He's too well-trained for that.
All that matters is that you've got him.
This proves Parraguez's desire to cooperate with us.
I have another witness to use against Mrs. Bascu?
án, but Parraguez is the only one that saw them together.
You need to find him before they kill him like Córdoba.
And I will, but for the last time, tell Parraguez to turn himself in tomorrow.
Good night.
Did they get Moreno?
He's been arrested.
I told D.A. Casas you cooperated with us, and he's willing to protect you.
I don't believe any of them.
What about congressman Cordoba?
They silenced him.
But it doesn't end here.
Casas is having Bascu?
án arrested tomorrow.
What?
Where?
In Valparaíso.
During a memorial service at the site of the attack.
Casas loves the drama.
I don't care, as long as he stops her.
You're the only witness.
You have to be there.
Are you insane?
They can't silence you, they'll be too many reporters.
And Casas will protect you.
You have to go, Álvaro.
The D.A. Needs you.
What about you?
Why do you think I'm doing this?
It's tomorrow, at jetty number 6, at noon.
Will you be there?
Yes, I'll be there.
I promise.
Take a map everybody.
I don't want you to get lost.
I'm switching my cellphone off.
The yacht's waiting for us right there.
Why there?
It's too risky.
That's a private club.
Because we're traveling in style, like European tourists.
See you there at noon.
Go with them, Tegui.
I can't, I have to drop Irma off.
They you'll all have to go with Irma.
I already told you.
You think it's normal to be carrying this kid around?
I still don't understand who this guy is.
There's no need, honey.
Listen, scumbag.
I want no surprises, is that clear?
The boat won't wait for anybody.
Calm down, Vicente.
I'll be watching this jerk.
Say goodbye.
Good luck baby.
Laura.
I want to go with you guys.
Trust me, this is what's best for you.
What?
How about some violins or something?
All this affection is making me sick.
Goodbye.
I'll be at the memorial service in Valparaíso, where I'll address all your questions.
Excuse me.
I said I'll address all your questions in Valparaiso.
Look at this.
A FUGITIVE IS FINALLY CAUGHT
Let's go.
Let's go.
CLOSED
DO NOT ENTER
You're not toasting?
I'm not sure the moment calls for a toast.
These last few days have been pretty awful.
Things should be a lot easier now.
"I'm on my way to Valparaíso".
Parraguez has to turn himself in, especially for your sake.
What do you mean?
You stuck your neck out for him, Ximena.
With his police record, it's not easy to keep him from doing time.
You said you'd help him.
I will help him, but I can't do miracles.
It all depends on the charges against Mrs. Bascu?
án.
How are you?
I'm just leaving.
Good for you.
That's the best thing you can do.
How are you doing?
How's your new life out of the closet?
That's not funny.
It hasn't been easy.
Tell all those cynics around you to fuck off.
Starting with your wife.
I'm sorry.
I wanted you to have only nice memories of me, but I don't think it's working.
I will never forget you, Vicente.
We're still in business, Vicente.
Not all is lost.
We just need to leave this damn country.
There's a future abroad.
You know where my future is.
We talked about it.
Don't be ridiculous.
You'll always be on the run.
Moreno is right.
You will always be at your mother's side.
Even if it's on the run.
He's Antonio Quijada.
I'm here for what you owe me, Ferragut, including the lives of my men.
Not so fast Quijada.
Pick up, damn it!
You're being transferred to a voice mailbox.
I can't take your call right now, leave a message after the tone.
Laura.
Listen up little sister.
I know what you did, and I swear on mom's grave it doesn't end here.
Adriana.
You always craved power.
Yes.
But I lost a son.
And that changes everybody.
I'm getting you out of here to do a job.
If you do, I'll get rid of your police record.
And you'll get paid under your new identity.
Ximena, you have my full support.
Now tell me who that man is, and where we can find him.
Wait here.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be back to get you.
Tegui.
I know I already told you, but I want to be with you.
Wait here for me.
I'm so sorry.
Today, we're gathered together to pray for peace.
Get out.
Get out, damn it.
I bless you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
We pray for the eternal peace of those that died here.
Men who gave their lives, while standing up
for peace in the homes of all Chileans.
I know for a fact that Mrs. Bascunán is Prefect Oliva's accomplice.
Detective Parraguez saw them together just now.
I think it's better to confirm that information.
I don't agree with you.
Don't worry.
You can count on me.
I bless you, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen.
May the peace of the Lord be with you.
And with you also.
You are being transferred to a voice mailbox.
I can't take your call right now, leave a message after the tone.
Do you know how much money we lost during the attack at the port?
Tons of high purity cocaine burned to ashes.
We lost our share of the money too.
I don't give a damn.
You're paying up Ferragut.
It's only fair.
I hope you know I'm betraying my own family.
My own mother.
I don't want a family like that to raise my son.
You must stop them.
Or they'll be the country's most powerful drug cartel.
I hope Cacho Aguilera's guys show up.
If that happens, there'll be a war and they'll kill each other.
IN MEMORY OF THOSE WHO DIED IN THE LINE OF DUTY
I bless you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.
Notify your men.
Arrest her as soon as she's done.
Yes sir.
Right here, just a few days ago, on this very spot, a tragedy took place.
I ask you to open your eyes.
There is danger all around us.
Fear is getting hold of us.
And you must never forget what happened.
These are crucial moments.
If we remain silent and don't do our jobs, we would not be doing the right thing.
I am willing to die for what I believe in.
And I hope you are too.
If just in Latin America those who fight this war had the same line of thought, it would be another totally different story.
And if our role is only to provide temporary assistance, whether it is offered voluntarily, or it is taken from us against our wishes, it wouldn't be a happy situation.
We can only prove our determination, firmness and courage, when we make it our personal struggle.
We will achieve our freedom by fighting.
Many brave men died here, who will be dearly missed.
But I, I assure you, that the lives of our fallen martyrs, were not lost in vain.
I know Chileans will be able to enjoy their freedom only after we have sacrificed enough, and put our strength to the test.
We must cleanse our hearts of all hatred.
At least in my own heart, there is no more hate.
I know we are on the edge of the abyss, and that Chile could fall at any time, but even if they want to cut our hands off,
I assure you that they won't be able to.
My very soul demands it.
And I have to try to push Chile away from the abyss.
That is my goal.
Just when I am about to make the most important decision I've ever made,
I can bear no hatred for the drug traffickers.
The thought that because of them...
That they are making the world sick, and that I must try to get rid of them, is totally absent from my mind.
You must not however, resort to violence.
Since that would be an insult to non-violence.
When such things occur you should assume that you won't find me alive wherever I may be.
Their blood will be on your hands.
If you can't understand that, you should reject this solution, and thus enhance your own merits.
I speak to you from the heart.
With my personal beliefs, and my integrity.
With the clarity with which I'm seeing reality, because I'm facing reality with no doubt in my mind, none whatsoever, looking at it directly, and defying it, but without any violence.
Because the only way that violence can emerge in our society, is in terms of the sacrifice, the sacrifice that all our government officials, our civil servants have to offer.
Of their own free will, personally, individually, sincerely, sensitively, guilelessly.
Honestly, openly, transparently.
In order to fearlessly face that which is destroying us.
Because there are deaths that are very meaningful to us.
That touch our lives.
That are offered as a sacrifice to our community.
So I say, enough.
Enough fear, dishonor, and humiliation.
That bastard.
Of treating each other as enemies in our own nation.
What we need to do is remember who we are.
Go back to feeling as part of the same country.
Of the same nation, the same homeland, Chile.
And the rest of Latin America.
All of us together as one, united in our own personal struggle, against the fear that we will conquer.
I propose a toast.
Because we're the ones that are left.
Because we're the best.
Which we will confront with patience, but with determination and firmness of mind.
I don't like to be kept waiting.
Without any fear.
Without any violence.
Thank you.
I trust that the deaths of these men who died while serving our country will never be forgotten.
I want to say that my son's untimely death, a victim of drugs and addiction did not just mark my life as a woman, but also as a civil servant.
That made me understand that sometimes the only response to violence
is violence itself.
And to death, death.
That conviction has guided my tireless fight against drugs.
And sealed my fate.
A destiny that is fulfilled here.
And now.
Who's the victim?
Stay out of it, you idiot, stay out of it.
I now ask you to please stand up.
To have a minute of silence for those who have died.
What do you want?
I want you to kill someone.
Who?
Me.
A sniper's firing at us!
I hold you responsible.
Look up there.
He shot Bascu?
án.
He can't get away!
Camilo, a patrol car will take you home.
Is there anyone to keep you company?
My family is dead.
I'm relieving you of your duties until the investigation is over.
This is crazy.
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
You know exactly where we're going.
Why don't you talk?
Try to say something that makes sense at least.
I'll try.
Please.
Please, show some respect.
Show some respect.
Congressman, congressman.
This event that just happened here, is a drug cartel behind it?
Just like the martyrs that died here a few days ago, she died fighting against what she most hated, drugs.
That is why we will never abandon her struggle.
Especially now that these criminals' power has reached government levels.
Thank you.
Álvaro, it's me.
Where are you?
What happened?
La Roja shot her.
I don't know, but Casas is mad, he's blaming you.
Why would I kill her?
I tried to save her life.
Go as far away as you can.
Come with me.
Let's get out of here.
It's dangerous.
You've protected him all this time.
Parraguez is a killer, you're covering up for him.
Plus you talk with him on the phone?
What are you doing?
Ximena Carbonell, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent, anything you say may be used against you.
This is ridiculous.
You can't do this.
- Sure I can.
Take her away.
- Are you insane, you idiot?
Casas.
You're sure it's him?
Yes, it's Oliva alright.
The boss had a price on his head.
Thanks.
They're not here.
What do you mean?
There's no such yacht.
- What are you talking about?
- What is Irma doing here?
Forget that.
Where's your sister?
Laura double-crossed us.
No way.
Yes way.
Quijada isn't Quijada.
The yacht, everything's a lie.
They tricked us.
- I'm Antonio Quijada.
- Good morning sir.
- Did you return the car?
- Yes.
- And the apartment keys too?
- Laura, get a hold of yourself.
Let's go.
Follow me.
Start the engine.
Start the engine now.
Help her.
I said start the engine now.
Move it, move it.
Our flight time to Easter Island is approximately five hours.
Cheers.
How could those idiots not see it?
I think your Spanish accent is excellent.
It's not that hard.
COAST GUARD
Drop your weapons!
Drop them now!
Get down!
Get down!
Moreno, my friend.
I'm glad to see you're okay.
I have nothing to say to you, Serrano.
These are some of Salamanca's dearest friends.
They'll make sure your time in prison is truly unforgettable.
Think you'll win?
Why do you think I walked up here in the snow?
- Cold as hell out there, right?
- Yeah, I can take it.
Oh, um, I need an ID for the wine cooler.
I'm clearly over 21...
- Cute picture.
- How much do I owe you?
Oh, ah, $11.36.
Here.
Good luck Wednesday!
Root'n for ya.
Oh, hey!
Wait up!
Hey!
Hey, hey, gorgeous!
Leslie!
Leslie!
OK, I'm up...
I'm up!
What time did he leave Kurt?
Hmm?
Was it 4 or 5?
He is a big jerk and naughty boy, Kurt.
Yes he is!
Say hello to Momma, Kurt! "Hi Momma!"
"Hello Momma!"
Kurt, that man said you were gonna talk and it has been almost a year.
No pressure!
No pressure!
I love you!
Excuse me!
...
Yeah, you.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Whoops, sorry Mrs. Brands. "Koogler Brown," please hold.
"Koogler Brown", please hold. "Koogler Brown",pleasehold.
"Koogler Brown", can I help you?
- Hi, I'm trying to reach Steve Mason.
- Who's calling, please?
-"Wendy."
Do you know what this is regarding, Wendy?
"Ah yeah, I would hope so."
One moment.
I am, so sorry, Wendy.
He's not in the office yet.
Would you like his voice mail?
"Yes, fine."
I'll see you at 3 o'clock then.
Make sure Davidson isn't late.
You got it!
Ah, Mr. Mason!
Ms. St. Martin?
I got you a present.
You snuck out last night.
Oh, thanks.
So, if you can make sure all my calls come directly to me unless I'm away from my desk.
In which case...
Steve?
...
Hang on!
- "Koogler Brown", Can I help you?
-You're busy.
You shouldn't...
- Lucy...
- Koogler...
I should be going.
Mr. Mason... "Koogler Brown", can I help you?
Who are you calling for?
One moment please, one moment please.
- Lucy.
- "Koogler Brown", please hold...
What?
Ah... ah... don't get upset, the copy machine is busted.
-Mannn!
- It's ah it's bad.
Ben, you cannot put stapled documents into the sorter.
I didn't.
What's this?
(Phone ringing) Can you get that?
Oh, I don't know how to do that.
You just say "Koogler Brown, please hold..."
- ...and just hum a song.
- Oh, OK.
"Koogler Brown, please hold."
And, I'll just do this from now on, it's my job anyway.
Oh, no.
I don't mind...
Who are you holding for?
Yeah, he's new...
Well then be more careful with it, OK?
Mrs. Brand doesn't need to know you're doing my job.
She already thinks I'm an idiot.
Whooo...
Whoa... my lord it's cold!
Not that bad.
Umm, you smell good.
Is that the cologne I bought you?
Ummm...
What's the matter?
You sure you don't have another tuna sandwich?
They go fast.
Tomorrow, I'll bring you two.
I'll set them aside, I promise.
You always say that.
Stop it!
...
STOP IT!
Lucy, I'm not going to let you make me the bad guy.
It's not fair!
You don't fit in, Lucy!
Honey, it's 20 degrees and look at what you're wearing!
You probably don't see it now... but this is the best thing that ever happened to you.
Aaaahhhh!
That's good.
That's a good reaction.
Good for you.
- That's it!
- You'll thank me, really!
Jerk.
Ben?
There's only one tuna today.
Do you want to split it?
Lucy...
I love you, Bo.
I love you, Daisy Duke.
Lucy...
- What Ben?
- I love you.
What?
Mom!
What, Ben?
Thanks for your help with the copy machine.
- Are you OK?
- Every thing's fine, Ben, now leave...
Ben, it's your mother.
She says it's urgent.
I suggest you get that...
At your desk!
It's me.
What's up?
What?
Mom... mom, you're talking too fast.
Thank you, Tom, for taking care of those contingency plans for us...
Now, let's move on to the numbers we have...
I would like to continue looking into that for next week's meeting... and see where we are on those totals and then we can look... at projected numbers for next quarter...
Hi.
We're in the middle of something here...
- Hi, I just want to let everybody know...
- Yes?
That... one night after Steve fucked me, he went into the bathroom and when I woke up the next morning, there was shit on the seat.
But I overlooked it, because I loved him, and I thought he loved me.
Thank you.
Have a great day.
Ow!
Oww.
(Car stalling)
Wait...
Wait!
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, ah.. my Mom is in trouble...
And, my car is not working.
It's probably nothing, but I have to...
Can I...?
You're home.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Mom!
OK, what's going on?
Why is the door locked?
Ben!
Ben!
Right here, right here...
Ben, what's the first thing your gonna buy?
Where did you get that lottery ticket?
Mom?
Ben!
Oh my God!
Benjamin!
Oh my baby!
Oh honey, you know your ticket?
The lottery ticket?
...
Well, I turned it around, and I called... and then these people were calling and calling.
And that TV producer over there?
He made me lie to you to get you home.
Oh, I'm so nervous.
Oh, my God...
Oh, my heart!
- I'm gonna have...
- We're set for you, Ben.
Where?
What?
Mom...
Mrs. Keller, it was you who found it?
Yes, yes, yes.
My son always takes me Wednesday and Friday to the... physical therapist, and uh, his car is such a mess... candy wrappers all over the place.
So I said to him... if you want to waste your money...
Well, I hate to say this... but if it weren't for good ole Mom, ha, ha, ha...
"You know, answer me one question.
"Why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me?
"Well, Ben Keller, I hope you deserve it.
"I don't know how how to out do that one people,
"but let's see if Justin Timberlake does the trick..."
Oh Heidi, I know... and me standing there like screaming like a manic...
Oh, no, that was just a prop they made for TV...
The real check comes in spurts...
Yeah...
What, it is already?
Ben, it's on again.
Are you watching?
Channel 7!
"Report is there is a winner in the Iowa State lottery.
"A new record of 36 million dollars.
"Won by a young man by the name of Ben Keller.

"Police are not releasing any information if...

Ben!
What are you doing?
Don't you want to talk to Uncle Barry?
Uh, I'll talk to him later, alright?
I'm going to take a shower!
He said "congratulations" and that we should get a lawyer.
Yeah, OK!
Are you hungry?
I'll be up in 15 minutes!
Okay, okay...

Oh...
She fine.
It just turned out to be, ah...

I was going to try to call you, but I don't have your number.
Plus, I wanted to say I'm sorry for being rude in the car...

You have every right to be mad at me.
You were trying to be nice, and I was being all "grrr!"

- You look great.
- Oh, I forgot my blusher.
- Mom, you can do that in the car...
Alright.
Thank you.
Did you take out the garbage?
Oh, I missed it.
Shit.
Lucy!
Hi!
Mrs. Keller, hi!
How are you?
Hi, Ben!
Look who's here.
Hi.
How are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh man... just been doing a little jogging.
On the weekends I jog.
You know, here and there....
Then here...
- Say something.
- What?
Well, enjoy.
Keep up the ole pace before I freeze to death.
Talk to you later!
Okay.
What?
Or...?
...how long?
...
You...?
What are you doing?
This is the newsroom.
OK?
Right.
- Hi Betsy.
- Hi Jeff.
Alright, and right in here is where we do the show.
Yeah...
OK.
Now your interview comes after the weather, and before sports.
So let's get you both into make-up.
And then we're going to mic you with microphones.
OK?
And guys, let me tell you, this is gonna be so much fun for you guys.
Are you ready?
Cause she's on the watch now.
Is she OK?
She's just really excited for the make-up.
City officials reiterate that there is no hard evidence... to relate the 3 disappearances.
Meanwhile the Singer family continues... to hope their daughter will return unharmed.
Awful, awful, awful story, Lance.
Coming up:
Can a trip to the Doctor be hazardous to your health?
And Josh Kincaid with the weather.
Where is she?
Chip is freaking out.
- She's not doing it , Ben.
She threw up.
- What?
Mom, we have to.
Chip is gonna kill us.
Benjamin Keller, look at your mother.
Just do it without her, Ben.
I'm not doing it if she's not.
I don't want to do it either but we told Chip we would.
- Fuck Chip!
- I'm with her.
But we said...
Hey, do you always do what other people tell you to do?
That's no way for a millionaire to behave.
Yeah!
Benjamin!
Don't you think I'm trying?
Shh!
Guys?
- They're ready for you.
- Bye, Chip!
You guys are crazy...
We should have gone out to dinner tonight, and taken Lucy with us.
She's got better things to do, I'm sure.
It's just so funny seeing her again.
Do you remember how close you two were when you were kids?
You were inseparable.
So cute.
It was a 100 years ago.
She did not have it easy, you know.
I would feel so bad...
You growing up without a father, and I would look at her's.
Well...
And when her mother died, and then to see you two together...
- I just...
- What are you saying?
Look, I don't want you to be afraid, OK?
Now that you have, you know...
What?
I don't know, I don't know.
I don't know...
I just... a mommy gets tired.
I feel like I'm going to the loony bin.
My son, the millionaire.
No, I'm not.
It's all a dream.
Yeap...
Big changes are coming...
Are you ready?
No.
Yes, you are.
"Hello?"
You about ready?
"Ready and waiting.
Where are you?"
- Greenleaf.
-"Did you make reservations?"
Yes, I did, I'll be there in a minute.
"You told them it's your birthday, right?
"Because they have that special cake that they only give to you...
- "...if you tell them."
- I told them, I told them.
- "What time?"
- I told them about 6.
- "Ben, that's too early!"
- But that's all they had.
- "Did you tell them who you are?
- No.
"Ben, we've been together for 2 months now.?
Haven't I taught you anything?"
Oh... don't start now, OK.
I'm already here.
- Handsome man.
- Beautiful woman.
- Upper body, today?
- No, I skipped.
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- I put you on a schedule for a reason.
You can't skip, you'll screw it all up.
Perfection!
Let's go shopping!
Let's go, Ben!
- Which one do you like?
- Is it me, or are they all just ugly?
Ben...
Ah, man, this is what Pauline wants.
She told me.
Well, last year, I got her a Whitman sampler and she loved it.
That was last year.
It had a little map to find all the chocolates.
I'm sure it did.
- Hey, listen to me a minute...
- Would you like to look at one?
Yes, the lady with the harp.
Alright then.
How about the mother and child?
Forgive me, but are you Benjamin Keller?
- Ah...
- Yes he is.
Ohhh... my goodness!
- How exciting.
- Can you hold this for a second?
How about the mother and child?
You went to high school with my son, Charlie Baton.
I'm Sue Baton.
Nice to met you.
But I need your help.
Ben, which one do you like.
Any one of these is fine.
Let's just make a decision and go.
Do you remember Charlie?
Because, he remembers you quite well.
- Who?
- How about a unicorn?
This one's nice too, depending on the occasion.
Oh, my God!
Oh my God!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!
Ah...
Oh my God!
We'll go... and we'll just pay for it, and just go.
- Ben, relax.
- Here, do you take Mastercard?
That's fine, don't worry.
You can certainly...
It was an accident.
We have another one like it right here.
Would you... would you...?
No, no, just ah...
Alright, alright, I'll just bring this back out.
No problem.
- I told you!
- What?
We should go.
Let's just go.
Hey, Ben, she has your card.
Just hang on.
- What's wrong with you?
- Let's just get out of here.
Alright, we should go!
Hey Ben, you may not know who you are, OK, but I do.
So you dropped a... a lady with the harp.
Who cares?
Hey!
You are Benjamin Keller, and you can do whatever you want.
Do it.
Aaaahhh!
What are doing?
You see?
"BEAUTIFUL WORLD" by Christoffer Hoyer begins...
"What a beautiful world..."
"Everywhere that I look on down the road...
"You stir, my soul."
"Such a beautiful day...
"Life is smiling, and pushing me the right way...
"...and then, on the way."
"Yesterday, when I was older...
"I was wise, but such a fool."
"Every page a new beginning...
"now I'm spinning...
"...in the sun."
(Whistling and then fades)
What do you think?
I've never seen anything like it.
- Your mom was so cute today.
- She's your mom too, now.
Yes, and now, it's just us...
I love you.
- I know.
- I mean, you've changed everything...
You know that, right?
Well...
Now, what do we do?
Ben... you know what comes next.
I do?
Wait here.
OK.
("HAPPY WHEN I'M WITH YOU" by Jody Whitesides begins)
"Doesn't matter, the time...
"...or the place."
"Only know there's a smile, taking over my face."
"Always seems to be in, when you're there."
"Justing feeling it inside, and it's in the air."
"I'm happy, when I'm with you!"
"I'm happy, when I'm with you!"
"It doesn't really even matter, what we do!"
"I'm hap, I'm hap, I'm hap...
"I'm happy, when I'm with...
"I'm happy, when I'm with...
"Happy, when I'm with you!"
"I'm hap, I'm hap, I'm hap...
"I'm happy, when I'm with you!"
"It doesn't really even matter, what we do!"
"I'm hap, I'm hap, I'm hap...
"I'm happy, when I'm with...
"Happy, when I'm with you!"
(Song fades)
Ah...
You're going to have to roll me home.
No, you are going to have to carry me.
Let's just get the hell out of here and go back to the hotel.
OK, I'll just go grab the waiter.
Can you just go get the bill?
- Yes.
Of course.
- Hurry.
- They didn't?
- No?
Fantastic.
- Ah...
Lucy...?
- Let's go.
- Do you have any cash?
- No.
Okay... um...
- Our credit card was declined.
- That's alright, we'll use our other card.
No, that's been dead for days.
No it's not, it comes right out of your account.
I know...
- It's empty.
- No, Ben...
That's impossible.
Because it's "36 million".
I mean, hello!
You know I don't get it all at one time, right?
I mean, it comes... it's not important.
- The point is that...
- We don't have any money?
That's why I was asking you if we had any cash.
At all?
Well... ah...
The wedding, the cars, this honeymoon, remodeling mom's house our new house.
It adds up.
Our new house?
I bought us a house.
It was suppose to be a surprise.
How much?
The house?
How much money have you spent, total?
Uh... eight... ty... hund...
Speak up!
Eight hundred thousand.
- In 3 months?
- Don't get mad, alright?
Look, we have our plane tickets for tomorrow, the hotel is taken care of...
And they'll mail me a new check in a week or two.
Everything will be fine.
- Trust me.
- Great.
How are we gonna get out of here?
14 dollars and 36 cents.
Well, that will be enough to get us to the airport.
Okay, great.
I don't have to eat.
Ohh, look!
A black banana!
- Lucy...
- I cannot believe it.
Do you have any idea how embarrassing that was?
I'll get you another bracelet.
No.
From now on, I'm handling the money.
When it feels good to actually do something for yourself.
Why do I have to do everything around here?
Could you please not yell at me?
You have been tipping people a 100 bucks a pop.
What happens tomorrow when "Mr. Big Man" can't give anybody, anything?
Please don't yell at me.
You threw away almost a million dollars!
Oh, so you married me for the money?
Is that it?
Dammit.
I'm sorry.
You are?
Is there a problem, Mr. Keller?
No, I'm not awake...
Allison.
Allison.
Oh... thank you.
Bet you want a tip now.
Mr. Keller?
...
Ugh!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben, I'm sorry...
"Help!"
"Help me!"
"Stop it!"
Hello?
Hello?
-" Whoohoo...
- argh!"
Sorry about that.
Argh... argh... argh...
Gargh... argh... argh...
Shit!
Hello?
Lucy?
Can I come in?
Lucy?
Things to do in Hawaii...
What!
Volcanoes.
We should pack.
Just tell me you don't hate me.
Please.
It will never happen again.
I just can't handle the idea of you being mad at me, alright?
...
You're right, you should handle the money.
It's.. it's.. it's our first fight.
It's our first, and last.
OK?
You really... hurt me back there, Ben.
Oh, no, no, please, please, don't say that.
You did, Ben.
Maybe, we rushed into all this.
No...
I'll do anything.
Anything.
Just please Just give me a chance.
Tell me what to do.
I just need to know that you'll never hurt me...
like that... again.
Never.
Say it.
I will never hurt you.
Never.
No matter what.
I would rather die.
How long have we know each other?
Hmm?
OK, Ben.
Really?
Thank you.
Thank you...
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I love you.
That's OK.
Heyyy!
Wow!
Welcome home.
My goodness.
So good to see you!
How was it?
Was it really great?
Oh..
I'm so happy to see you.
Lucy?
You look exhausted...
- Where's your cane?
- Carl tossed it.
I don't need it any more.
- What?
That is fantastic!
- Who's Carl?
Carl's my trainer.
You know I'm really worried about her.
- Oh, she is just tired.
Honey, you OK?
I'm fine...
I'm fine...
Where are we?
Well...
I know you're mad that I did this.
And we don't have to live here, it's not definite, but...
I thought you might want to see it.
- Are you going to get the bags?
- No, leave it, leave it.
- Kurt!
- Oh, he missed you terribly.
We have to talk.
- Who are all these people?
- Mom, I told you...
I know, I know, but it was too late to cancel the caterers.
and I thought what a wonderful way to met you neighbors....
That's OK.
Hi!
Crowd: "Hi!"
I'm Lucy.
How are you all?
Your mother has been telling us about all your adventures.
Grace and Jonathan live right next door.
I'm just so glad that somebody bought this terrific house.
Gracie helped me with the guest list.
They know everybody in town.
- Now ask John about the country club.
- Yeah, do you play golf?
He would love that.
And Lucy could swim or play tennis.
Okay.
Girl, you look so cute, my goodness we miss you.
We really do.
Oh, well...
- Are you ever gonna come back?
- What do you think?
- Will you excuse me for a minute?
- Thanks for inviting us!
Hi.
Hello.
Want my drink?
You can throw it in my face.
That won't be necessary.
That's strong, though.
- Great house.
- Thank you.
You know, I really have you to thank for it.
Because when we were together ...and you said that whole thing about about holding each other back.
You know you were right.
OK...
No, really, because I have Ben, and this house, and...
- You, are you partner yet?
- No, not yet.
- You didn't introduce us.
- I would like to know who did.
She grew up next door.
She didn't need to be introduced.
She was just there.
Oh, stop it.
- Well, where is Lucy?
Let's met her.
- Yeah, enough of the mystery.
Oh...
I saw her around here, somewhere.
She's ah...
Well, she's talking to somebody right now.
So, how's Hawaii?
Ah... uh... oh... uh... ah...
Ben?
Yeah... uh...
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Just... uh?
Honey?
- Ben?
What's wrong?
- I don't know...
I thought...
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Met our neighbors.
These are our neighbors.
This is Lucy.
-Thank you so much!
-You're welcome!
Everything was delicious!
Honey, I'm going to get going.
Oh, Oh, don't wanna come in for a cup of coffee?
No, no, no.
I am so exhausted.
I'm fine...
Well, if you're so tired, maybe you should spend the night.
Welcome home.
That was fun.
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.
You scared me though...
You almost fainted.
Yeah?
Yeah, I should get some sleep.
Saw you talking to "Steve Mason".
- Yeah, he was here...
- He's an asshole.
I am well aware of that.
You're not jealous, are you, Ben?
- It's just he's sooo...
- Ben, shut up!
If anyone's gonna be jealous here, it's gonna be me!
OK?
I saw you talking to that neighbor!
In fact, get out of here!
Go sleep on the coach!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
I love you so much.
I know.
- But you...
(Blows on her neck)
- Pppphhhttt!
Ben!
Oh...
Uh....
Uh...
Ah...
"Our latest victim, Leslie Singer, is presumed dead...
"at this point, missing for 3 months.
The search goes on...
Ben.
"These are all the locations where the girls were taken...
Oh, my God.
"...by Det.
Waylon...
Oh, God.
"3 girls missing from the Council Buffs area of Iowa.
"All of them have blond hair.
They are 5'6" to 5'8" and weigh 110 to 135 lbs."
I decided it would be fun to dress up one of the rooms with Ben's... old toys and trophies from school.
I would hate to see what it looks like down there!
Ah... this is really not an opportune time.
Thank you so much!
It's gonna mean so much to him...
- Oh, but I've been waiting for Carl.
- Carl?
- My trainer?
- OK, go ahead, and I'll lock myself out.
(Car honks horn)
- "Lucy?
- What, Ben?
"I love you."
Ben, why not just try meth while you're at it.
Now you're showing me this?
I was here three months ago, I asked if you knew her.
- I don't think it was me.
- No?
I forgot about it.
She never came back.
I haven't...
I'm gonna need your surveillance tapes.
Copy of all your receipts.
We'll get that.
Come on, Chris.
What can this be?
Did you slip on a banana peel too?
Door bell: "Ding Dong!"
- Hello.
- Hey!
I'm sorry to bother you on a Sunday, Mr. Keller.
I'm Det.
Waylon, and I'm working on the Leslie Singer case.
- What?
- Leslie Singer.
She's the... well you may not know.
She's the young...
Whoa, Kurt!
- I'm sorry!
Are you OK?
- I'm Fine.
- I know this bird.
- Oh!
We're gonna go for a ride, ladies.
Won't that be fun?
Sorry, but I had to dig you up before the new owners did.
I'll come back for you guys.
Well, tons of people bought lottery tickets that day.
- I bet even Leslie bought one.
- Why do you say that?
Oh...
Oh, well...
Everybody wants to win the lottery, don't they?
36 million?
You know what you should do?
You should find all the people that bought lottery tickets that day...
- And ask if they saw her.
- That's a good idea.
Except, I can't do that.
People, for the most part, use cash to buy tickets.
The only person I know who bought a ticket that day, was you.
Why?
Because you won.
That's right.
Well...
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.
My card is on the picture there.
I will.
Ah, I gotta ask you something.
What?
What's it like?
Oh... ah...
Well... ah...
You know how they say your life totally changes?
Uh, huh.
They're not lying.
You're a lucky bastard.
God speed!
"I have 3 dead ladies, lying in my car...
"My husband killed 3..." Ahhh...
Hello?
Yes?
What?
OK...
OK.
Will do, good bye!
"My husband killed..."
- Shannon, get Brentford out of the pool.
- Oh no, that's OK.
If I can wander around in my pajamas, your dog can swim in my pool.
You can wander around in your pajamas any time.
So Grace, what is it you do?
- I'm a family planner.
- I'm not sure what that is.
- John, are you doing OK on that drink?
- I'm fine, I must say.
I mostly work with inner city families, single parents...
- Shannon...
Is she home from college?
- Northwestern.
Oh... great!
That's really great.
"I'vegot3deadgirls,inmycar...
"3 young ladies, that look just like me...
"AndI 'mbringinghimchicken..."
Who's hungry?
What happened?
Oh!
...
Oh, my God...
Oh.
What a funny story...
Where did you go?
What?
Um...
Oh, you know...
- The Garden Center.
- The Garden Center...
Wait a minute!
So...
I am... just
Leaning over looking at the Azalea's, and I tripped and fell...
And landed in a pile of mulch...
Oh, you poor thing!
.
Crazy.
All the flowers are dead.
I mean it's a terrible location.
I mean it's like... whoa!
Honey, I think that maybe ah... you should... maybe you should go inside and get cleaned up.
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm fine.
Hi Grace, How are you?
Hi, Grace...
Oh!
Sorry.
- And ah...
- Jonathan.
Jonathan!
I haven't seen you guys since...
You know, the... welcome home party, right... that was...?
How long ago was that?
That was last night, wasn't it?
Was it?
And this is Shannon, our daughter.
Lucy honey, you're shaking like a leaf.
- Well that's a very pretty young girl.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
Shannon is a sophomore at Northwestern.
Do you wanna think about maybe...
changing your hair color?
Do you wanna think doing about that?
Why?
Well, aren't you afraid of that "Council Bluff Killer"?
Lucy!
Right, that is what they are calling him now, right?
And you are exactly his type.
Right... am I right?
Right?
- Am I wrong?
- Well, maybe you should, Shannon.
We can't let some lunatic govern how we live our life, Grace.
- We can't?
- Lucy!
She's OK, she's OK.
Honey?
Honey?
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- She alright?
Should I...
She's OK, she's OK.
Honey?
Does anyone want chicken?
- I say that's dishonest.
- No, Lady bugs.
Are Lady bugs the one's that bite the heads off their husbands?
No, that's the Preying Mantis.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come on in, Lucy.
- Oh, no, you don't want me.
- Come on.
Don't be shy.
Is it cold?
No.
It's great.
It is great.
Are any of you guys married?
- It's strange.
- What's it like?
- I don't know.
- They say communication is the key.
And honesty.
- Once the check comes, I'm outta here.
- Right, that will happen...
I am!
It's not that easy.
He can't hurt me.
It's all about me.
- What are you doing?
- What?
You shouldn't be out here, you need your rest.
I just wanted to try the pool.
Here.
It's fine...
You should come inside.
I don't want you to catch a cold.
I'm fine, every thing's fine.
Come to bed.
Let me swim some more.
I'll be in soon.
OK.
Just when I thought I made some new friends.
I'm sorry you guys.
I really I'm.
I just...
I know what I'm doing.
Well, you're up early.
- Gardening.
- Ah.
I hope you're feeling better you scared us to death.
Yeah.
Very dramatic, I am.
This thing has everyone spooked.
You're not alone.
We just all have to keep a close eye on each other.
You're right!
So, how are these famous Azaleas?
The what?
The...
From the Garden Center?
Hey!
Hi.
Let's eat.
- Is it there?
- No.
Well, it will get here.
- Well?
- No.
- Is there someone we can call?
- I did, and it's a recording.
We're out of eggs.
Sorry.
That's OK.
You know that this will never happen again... now that you and I are... you know really a team.
I mean, together, we'll make sure this never...
- I think I'm pregnant.
- What?
Maybe, I'm not...
I don't...
I'm not really sure.
I guess it happened in Hawaii, if I even am, I don't know...
Oh, God...
OK, well ah...
We gotta get one of those ah...
one of those test.
Or...
Mom will know what to do.
No, Ben, hang on.
This is fantastic.
This is great.
Ben, it's too early to...
Mom, guess what?
...
You're just gonna get all worked...
It's probably nothing!
- Lucy's pregnant.
- Oh, God, no...
But we don't have any money for one of those test.
What should we...?
OK.
OK, OK.
Ben...
So mom is gonna go and buy one of those test.
and you're gonna go over her house and you're gonna take it...
I'm just asking you to calm down, OK?
We don't have to deal with this right now.
Oh, my God!
Where's the fucking check?
I mean you're eating for two now, and all you have to eat is eggs?
Jesus Christ...
That's it.
You're going to mom's, and I'm going to call the lottery.
And I swear, where ever that check is,
I promise you, it will be here when you get home.
OK?
Now go.
- I gotta go get dressed...
- No, no, no, no, just go, OK?
Go.
Now, Two lines, you're pregnant.
One line, you're not.
OK.
Are you OK?
You look exhausted.
It's just been a rough week.
How long is this thing gonna take?
Oh...
I remember while I was waiting to hear about Ben.
I just thought I was going crazy.
- Hear what about Ben?
- If I was pregnant.
You know, he loves you so much.
You just mean so, so, much to him.
At the wedding, you both looked so beautiful.
And you!
You looked like an angel sent from heaven.
- Oh, well...
- You did!
Well then, I knew I could stop worrying about Ben...
See, I'm his mother, and I worry.
I know, that you will give him a good life.
You've helped him so much already.
You know.
I know that... that you are the best thing that ever happened to him.
You know what he does.
I know that he loves you, and he needs you.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
There's nothing to tell.
What are you talking about?
Lucy, it's one line.
It's OK.
Oh, honey you've got time...
Look, it will happen when you least expect it.
I promise you!
Oh, honey...
Yes!
Rosemary is not having a baby!
Oh, my God!
Finally a little luck!
- I don't understand.
- Nobody is buying that anymore.
The first year of marriage is the hardest.
I mean, that is what they always say...
Fuck you!
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.
I can't believe I just said that to you.
- No, it's my fault.
- No, it's not.
I try very hard, but you know, when they grow up, and... however, whatever, whatever you did...
Pauline, come with me.
I have the car.
Let's just go.
Don't pack, let's just go.
- Go where?
- So I don't get the money, right?
...
- Who cares?
- What money?
Come on.
Pauline...
- No, no, no, he's my boy.
I can't...
- Pauline...
No.
I love you.
Benjamin.
How are you doing sweetheart?
No, she isn't.
Honey, I want you to listen to mommy now.
(Cell phone ringing)
Hello?
"Hi."
Hi.
"Sorry, mom told me about the test."
Yeah, I'm not gonna have a baby.
"Yeah."
Ben, I'm really sorry, but I can't do this anymore.
"I've got the check."
What?
"It came right after you left."
Oh?
"See you at home."
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.
- You're a busy guy.
- Yeah.
OK, Leslie... guy who bought condoms...
Mom with scouts... a dumb kid...
Guy buying cigarettes...
A mother and child...
Ben, I'm home!
Hello?
Ben?
Don't look at me like that, I wasn't going to leave without you.
Ben!
Ben!
Hello?
Come on, Kurt.
There you go.
I know it smells like dead bodies in here.
But you'll get use to it, Kurt.
OK?
I did it, Kurt.
I did it.
It's not like I planned it.
But nobody can say I didn't do it.
I got my bird, and I got my check.
Your really gonna like Canada, Kurt, they have...
Well, I actually don't know what they have there but...
I just know that we're gonna love it.
I'm mad at you.
I don't know how to begin.
I'm in shock.
- Ben, stop it!
- You know, I didn't believe her.
I said you were just upset because you weren't pregnant.
Now that we are a team.
Do you have any idea how disappointed I am?
I'm not gonna sit here and listen to a lecture from you.
Yes, you will!
Ben, Ben, Ben..
Ben..
Ben..
Ben..
Ben...
You can't hurt me.
Remember...
remember our little talk...
OK?
So, let's just calm down.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm realistic.
Now, I know that marriage isn't easy and that...
I may not be experienced in the ways of amore.
But I know that.
Ben, listen...
I ah... might have married you under false pretenses...
But, after spending time with you, I came to really you know, to really, really...
And then you started killing people, Ben!
And it's just too much!
Marriages take work.
This has been our biggest mistake.
We have just been sitting back...
Hoping for a miracle.
Well, I've done a lot of the work already.
Now, the first thing I did, was to eliminate all distraction.
BEN!
That hurts!
This hurts.
Your...
When you kill people, you are hurting me, and you can not hurt me!
OK, now you're just getting me on a technicality.
Alright, come with me.
I want to show you something.
Help!
Lucy!
I really need you to be coherent.
I went to a lot of trouble here.
Ben!
Now, Grace here, is gonna help us get through the rough spots.
I can't do this, I can't do this...
Leave, and she dies.
Lucy, honey, please sit down.
Let's try and act like adults.
OK.
Grace, scream, and I cut you.
OK, Grace... when you have gotten yourself together.
I'd like for you to tell me and Lucy...
What it is we are doing wrong.
I told you...
I'm a family planner, not a marriage counselor.
- I don't even have a degree.
- It's the same ballpark.
Ben, let her go!
Just say... something.
Is your marriage based on honesty, and mutual respect?
Yes!
No, it is not, Ben.
I married you for the money, and you like to kill people.
No...
like to kill people?
What?
- They're burned in the yard?
- I don't put them there!
That was all you.
I thought you were trying to help me there!
Garden Center?
Wink... wink.
Here I thought we were a team.
- A team?
- Who did you kill?
Grace, have you ever wanted something, so much...
And when you couldn't have it you had to argh...
- ...but you couldn't.
- You're insane!
- I'm not saying I'm proud of myself.
- You seemed like such nice people.
- Stop talking!
- Such nice people!
We are still nice people, but we're also in love...
And love is scary, I'm starting to realize that now.
I don't love you.
- Yes, you do..
- I want to go home.
Well, that depends on my partner here.
Ben, You have a long ways ahead of you, OK?
Don't live it like this.
I'm not worth it.
Not by a long shot.
- I love you.
- I don't love you.
I love you.
- Let me go!
- Let me go too!
All I want is to be able to kiss, you... and have you kiss me...
And to feel you mean it.
That's all I want.
Ben, I don't know.
Maybe if...
- ...
I hadn't been so...
- Greedy.
- And you hadn't...
- Killed all those people?
- ...killed all those people.
- Maybe things...
- Would have been different?
- I wish they were.
I really do.
Suddenly, the money doesn't seem to matter much, does it?
Grace...
Lucy!
Lucy, we're not done talking!
Get back here!
Lucy!
Please, don't leave me, Lucy!
Look at what you did!
Lucy...
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it...
Just take something sharp, and stab me with it, and kill me with it...
Bury me under the hedges with the rest of them...
Excuse me.
No one answered at the front door.
Is everything OK?
Detective!
Mr. Keller, I need to ask you a few more questions.
Do you mind if we go inside?
- I ah, don't mean to be rude, but...
- But what?
Well, we're swimming here.
So if you could maybe come back, tomorrow?
Mr. Keller, I reviewed the surveillance tape from the... convenience store where you bought the ticket.
Yeah?
You're not on them.
Excuse the mess.
I'm still unpacking.
Fine.
I understand.
So ah, you're asking me how I could have bought my lottery ticket... and still not be on the tape?
- On point.
- Well, you're obviously on the tape he just looks different.
He's been working out.
He's bigger.
Not that much bigger.
You're on the tape, don't be stupid, you're drunk.
He's drunk, he's been swimming.
I know why I'm not on the tape.
You're on the tape!
Detective, are you accusing him of something?
Because if you are...
I snapped her neck in the parking lot.
I never even stepped foot in the store.
That's how I'm not on that tape.
Marriage is based on honesty.
That is what Grace said.
Sometimes the truth hurts.
I'm sorry.
You couldn't hurt me even if you wanted too.
Alright, I want you two to sit down.
We're gonna take this as calmly as possible.
The more calmly we do this, the better off we'll be.
- I want... the check.
- Well, you don't get anything.
- Unless, it's me.
- Nobody wants you.
You can have me.
Mr. Keller, tell your wife to give me the gun.
- You don't win.
I won't let you.
- Gimme the gun.
- It's not fair!
- Put that gun down, Mrs. Keller.
- Just admit it, Lucy.
- What?
- You love me.
- Shut up!
- Mrs. Keller, give me that gun.
- Just admit it, you love me.
- I don't want too!
- Give me the gun, Mrs. Keller.
Add it to the pile.
Can you turn that up, please?
"They were as nice as can be."
"He invited us to lunch, just the week before."
"Looking back...
looking back, she doesn't remember that night at all."
"No, I hit my head, very hard..."
"What happened afterwards?"
"Well, after she was home safe, everyone..."
Is this really "The Sunny Mart"?
Why would I lie?
- Kurt says "hello".
- What are you doing here?
- No, no, I mean he actually says "Hello"
- What do you want?
I ah...
I wanted to make that sure you're OK.
Lucy, I didn't think it was gonna end this way.
You didn't?
I told them that it was me!
Those women under the hedge... they had your DNA, or your fibers, or whatever all over them.
I mean, you shot Detective Waylon!
I know what I did.
What about, what you did?
Well...
I think, we should just put the past behind us...
I asked you a question.
How much does a jury cost nowadays?
Is it expensive?
Jonathan and Grace, they cost a lot of money, ...is there any money left?
At all?
Mom says hello.
I'm gonna get out of here, and I'm gonna set you on fire.
- Did you get any of my letters?
- I mean it... fire!
OK, OK, ah...
I love you anyway.
Wait, wait!
I know you, Ben.
And ah, pretty soon...
Tonight even...
You're gonna go home, and you're gonna get to thinking about me...
How much you love me.
How we belong together, and...
How you still, don't really have me...
And when some 27 year old blond woman, about 5'6", 125 lbs... doesn't come back from her aerobics class...
Everybody's gonna know, what's, what.
I don't expect to be here much longer.
Not long at all.
- I don't think that's gonna happen.
- And then I gonna set you on fire!
You may be right...ah you normally are, but ah...
Since you've been here, I just I haven't had that urge.
It's not that I like the idea of you rotting away in here, I don't...
Get out.
- Get out!
Get out...
- It just makes me feel.
...and don't ever come back here!
Ever!
Guard!
Guard!
Hello, I'm ready to go back.
Take me back!
- I love you, Lucy!
- I'm ready to go.
Take me away!
- I love you!
- Screw you!
Fuck you!
Goodbye, Lucy!
Ben, wait, wait!
I have time, I still have time left...
Ben.
Ben!
Yes?
It's almost been a year now...
I know.
Would you like me to come back?
Yes.
Would you?
Of course.
Tomorrow?
I'll be here.
- Kurt spoke?
- Yeah, I was at the house maybe Wednesday, or Thursday, and ah...
What did he say?
"Hello"
"Hello", that's what he says.
Just "hello", all the time.
Around... around the clock.
Have you been working out?
Aaahhh....
Ben, no skipping.
You're screw it all up and turn puny again!
I know, it's just...
I really need someone to motivate me.
It's so boring.
Ben, what do you want?
Somebody to hold your hand?
You just have to get in there and do it!
OK...
Hey, just don't say "OK".
Just do it!
- OK.
- Promise me.
I promise.
You gonna work that chest tomorrow?
If you find any problems with this sub...
Mysterious message!
A transmission has been intercepted far beyond the Outer Rim, deep in the Crelythiumn system.
Why the call has been made, and from where, cannot be established.
But buried in the message is a Jedi distress code that has not been used in over 2,000 years.
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka, are sent to investigate.
Fearing a Separatist trap, they are to meet with a heavily armed Jedi cruiser.
Rex.
Rex, do you read me?
We're at the rendezvous point awaiting your arrival.
Where are you?
Sir, we're at the rendezvous point and there's no sign of you on our scanners.
Oh, come on.
That's impossible.
Something's wrong.
We're at the exact coordinates where the distress signal originated, but there's nothing here.
Rex is at the exact same coordinates, and he's not here.
This is getting interesting.
Unable to find you.
Where are you, sir?
Something's blocking the signal.
Not good.
Everything's dead.
Even the life support.
This is really strange.
There.
See?
Nothing to be concerned about after all.
Then what's that?
It's pulling us towards it.
Everyone, strap yourselves in.
Looks as though we're going for a ride.
I must have blacked out.
Then who landed the shuttle?
Not me.
Where are we?
Some kind of organic mass.
All of our readings indicate that it's bigger than an asteroid.
But at least the atmosphere is breathable.
Well, this is getting more unusual by the minute.
I can't even lock down where in the galaxy we are, or if we are even in our own galaxy.
Well, the ship's systems seem fine, but for whatever reason, nothing's working.
Hey!
I saw something.
A reflection, up on the hill.
I don't see anything.
Are you the one?
What the...
What?
Did you hear that?
I didn't hear anything.
Are you the one?
- Hello!
- Who are you?
I am Daughter.
Are you the one?
Uh, the one what?
I will take you to him.
Him, who?
Did you bring us here?
Only he can help you.
There is little time.
Follow me.
We must have shelter by nightfall.
And we thought the planet was strange.
How about this one?
We'll be fine as long as we stay together.
Have you noticed the seasons seem to change with the time of day?
Yeah.
And there are no animals.
- And you sense it?
- Mmm-hmm.
Since we arrived.
The Force is very strong.
An intersection unlike anything I've ever felt before.
Be wary.
Excuse me.
Who are you taking us to?
The father, of course.
Of course!
And what exactly are you?
We are the ones who guard the power.
We are the middle, the beginning and the end.
Glad she cleared that up for us.
Hey!
Look out!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
It is forbidden for you to touch me.
Sorry.
I was just saving your life.
That was my brother's work.
You are in great danger.
Wait for me.
Do not leave this place.
Hey.
Wait!
Anakin, are you there?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
But our friend here has run off!
Go back to the ship and try sending another distress call.
I'll follow her and find out how to get off this rock.
And if this is a trap?
Then I'm not gonna wait around to find out.
Anakin, stop!
Wait for us to find another way around and meet you.
Anakin?
So reckless and impatient.
He'll find her.
Yes, and what else?
Storm's coming.
- The ship's gone!
- Yes, I see that.
It was here, no question.
And look, everything's dying.
Did you lose something?
You didn't do as you were asked.
And what was that?
My sister said to wait!
Did she, now?
Well, we were unfortunately separated.
We'd like our ship back, if you don't mind.
Not yet.
Is it true that he is the Chosen One?
What do you know of such things?
What is about to happen shall occur, whether you like it or not.
You are Sith!
Sith?
Yes.
And no.
The storms here are quite lethal.
If you want to live, I suggest you find shelter.
What in the universe was that?
I'm not quite sure.
Quick.
There's a cave over there.
Whoever I'm looking for is in that monastery.
Welcome, my friend.
What is it that you want from me?
To learn the truth about who you really are.
One that maybe you have known all along.
One you must believe in order to fulfill your destiny.
Enough with the riddles, old man.
Tell me what's going on here.
As you can see, there is nowhere else to go.
It is late.
You will be my guest tonight.
Obi-Wan, have you done as I asked?
Have you trained the boy?
Master Qui-Gon?
How are you here?
I am here because you are here.
No.
I don't understand.
What is this place?
Unlike any other, a conduit through which the entire force of the universe flows.
Are we in danger?
This planet is both an amplifier and a magnet.
Three are here who seek Skywalker.
They, like me, believe him to be the Chosen One.
You were right, the Force within him is stronger than any known Jedi.
I have trained him as well as I could, but he's still willful and balance eludes him.
If he is the Chosen One, he will discover it here.
And if not?
Then you must realize, with his power, this is a very dangerous place for him to be.
Wake up, my son.
I must tell you a secret.
Who's there?
Who's there, I said?
It is me, Ani.
Your mother.
What kind of black arts is this?
You're dead.
Nothing ever really dies, my son.
I have a secret to tell you.
Then tell me.
Everything you have done, everything you have learned, has led you here.
Whatever you are, my mother is...
- Is dead.
- And you blame yourself.
Your Jedi training has served you well, Ani, but you are more than a Jedi.
Tell me, where is your pain, so I might take it away?
I was too late to save you.
I failed as a Jedi, and I failed you.
How so?
I tasted only vengeance when I slaughtered so many to avenge your death.
It is time you realized that your guilt does not define you, my son.
You define your guilt.
The only love I feel in my heart is haunted by what would happen should I let go.
Then it is not love.
It is a prison.
But I have a wife.
You've met her.
She's everything to me.
She is not your destiny.
But I love her!
No!
She is a poisoner!
What are you?
Your fate!
Are you happy, child?
Your master, does he treat you well?
What concern of it is yours?
I am your future, your potential.
This is a trick.
There is a wildness to you, young one.
Seeds of the dark side planted by your master.
- Do you feel it?
- No!
He is like no other Jedi.
Passionate, impulsive, but I trust him with my life.
There are many contradictions in you.
And in him.
Be warned!
You may never see your future if you remain his student.
Leave this planet!
Ahsoka?
I had a vision.
I think Anakin may be in trouble.
Cannot sleep?
To strike an unarmed man is hardly the Jedi way.
You're a Sith Lord!
You have a very simple view of the universe.
I am neither Sith nor Jedi.
I am much more.
And so are you.
I see through your spells and visions, old man.
Tell me what is going on here!
Some call us Force-wielders.
The Jedi have never spoken of this.
Hmm.
Few still know of our existence.
In that room, my mother came to me.
But it was not her.
- It was something else.
- Ah.
My son, I suspect.
We can take many forms.
The shapes we embody are merely a reflection of the life force around us.
You carry a great sadness in your heart.
My children and I can manipulate the Force like no other, therefore it was necessary to withdraw from the temporal world and live here as anchorites.
As a sanctuary?
And a prison.
You cannot imagine what pain it is to have such love for your children and realize that they could tear the very fabric of our universe.
I don't understand.
It is only here that I can control them.
A family in balance.
The light and the dark.
Day with night.
Destruction replaced by creation.
Then why reveal yourselves to us?
There are some who would like to exploit our power.
The Sith are but one.
Too much dark or light would be the undoing of life as you understand it.
When news reached me that the Chosen One had been found,
I needed to see for myself.
The Chosen One is a myth.
Is it?
I should very much like to know.
Why don't we find out together?
Pass one test and I shall know the truth.
Then, you and your friends may leave.
The longer we stay here, the stranger this place gets.
It appears the planet is renewing herself.
What about Master Skywalker?
Anakin will not be easy to deceive.
It is time to face your guilt and know the truth.
Whatever he wants, don't do it, Master!
Let them go.
I will not play your games.
Oh, but I think you will.
I have ordered my children to kill your friends.
The question is, which one will you choose to save?
Your master?
Or your apprentice?
You must now release the guilt and free yourself by choosing.
No!
Their powers are too strong for us, Anakin!
Save Ahsoka!
Let them go.
Only you can make my children release them.
Anakin!
The planet is the Force.
Use it.
You will let them go!
Down!
On your knees!
And now you see who you truly are.
Only the Chosen One could tame both my children.
I've taken your test.
Now fulfill your promise and let us go.
Ah, but first, you must understand the truth.
Now, all of you, leave us.
Do not trust him.
You think?
I said, leave us!
Do you feel your destiny?
You must see it now.
I am dying, and you must replace me.
Replace you?
I can't stay here.
But this is yours.
It has been foretold.
The Chosen One will remain to keep my children in balance.
No.
I cannot force you to do this.
The choice must be yours.
But leave and your selfishness shall haunt you and the galaxy.
Ready to get out of here?

I failed as a jedi and I failed you.
How so?
I tasted only vengeance when I slaughtered so many to avenge your death.
It is time you realized that your guilt does not define you, my son.
You define your guilt.
The only love I feel in my heart is haunted by what would happen should I let go.
Then it is not love.
It is a prison.
But I...
I have a wife.
You've met her.
She's everything to me.
She is not your destiny.
But I love her.
No!
She is a poisoner!
What are you?
Your fate!
Are you happy, child?
Your master, does he treat you well?
What concern of it is yours?
I am your future, your potential.
This is a trick.
There is a wildness to you, young one.
Seeds of the dark side planted by your master.
Do you feel it?
No.
He is like no other jedi.
Passionate, impulsive, but I trust him with my life.
There are many contradictions in you...
And in him.
Be warned, you may never see your future if you remain his student.
Leave this planet!
Ahsoka.
I had a vision.
I think Anakin may be in trouble.
[Lightsaber hums]
Cannot sleep?
To strike an unarmed man is hardly the jedi way.
You're a sith lord!
You have a very simple view of the universe.
I am neither sith nor jedi.
I am much more...
And so are you.
I see through your spells and visions, old man.
Tell me what is going on here.
[Low humming and crackling]
Some call us force-wielders.
The jedi have never spoken of this.
Mm.
Few still know of our existence.
In that room, my mother came to me, but it was not her.
It was something else.
Ah.
My son, I suspect.
We can take many forms.
The shapes we embody are merely a reflection of the life force around us.
You carry a great sadness in your heart.
My children and I can manipulate the force like no other, therefore, it was necessary to withdraw from the temporal world and live here as anchorites.
As a sanctuary?
And a prison.
You cannot imagine what pain it is to have such love for your children and realize that they could tear the very fabric of our universe.
I don't understand.
It is only here that I can control them...
A family in balance.
The light and the dark.
Day with night.
Destruction replaced by creation.
Then why reveal yourselves to us?
There are some who would like to exploit our power.
The sith are but one.
Too much dark or light would be the undoing of life as you understand it.
When news reached me that the chosen one had been found,
I needed to see for myself.
The chosen one is a myth.
Is it?
I should very much like to know.
Why don't we find out together?
Pass one test, and I shall know the truth.
Then you and your friends may leave.
The longer we stay here, the stranger this place gets.
It appears the planet is renewing herself.
What about master Skywalker?
Anakin will not be easy to deceive.
[Wings flapping]
[Loud screeching]
It is time to face your guilt and know the truth.
[Loud screech]
Roar!
Whatever he wants, don't do it, master!
[Grunting and gasping]
[Screeches]
Let them go.
I will not play your games.
Oh, but I think you will.
I have ordered my children to kill your friends.
The question is, which one will you choose to save:
Your masr or your apprentice?
You must now release the guilt and free yourself by choosing.
No!
[Gasps]
Their powers are too strong for us, Anakin.
Save ahsoka.
[Growling]
[Gasping and groaning]
Let them go.
Only you can make my children release them.
Anakin, the planet is the force.
Use it.
You will let them go!
[Screeching]
[Dramatic singing]

Down!
On your knees!
And now you see who you truly are.
Only the chosen one could tame both my children.
I have taken your test.
Now fulfill your promise and let us go.
Ah, but first you must understand the truth.
Now all of you, leave us.
Do not trust him.
You think?
I said leave us.
Do you feel your destiny?
You must see it now.
I am dying, and you must replace me.

NARRATOR:
Mysterious message!
A transmission has been intercepted far beyond the Outer Rim, deep in the Crelythiumn system.
Why the call has been made, and from where, cannot be established.
But buried in the message is a Jedi distress code that has not been used in over 2,000 years.
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan, Ahsoka, are sent to investigate.
Fearing a Separatist trap, they are to meet with a heavily armed Jedi cruiser.
Rex.
Rex, do you read me?
We're at the rendezvous point awaiting your arrival.
Where are you?
Sir, we're at the rendezvous point and there's no sign of you on our scanners.
Oh, come on.
That's impossible.
Something's wrong.
We're at the exact coordinates where the distress signal originated, but there's nothing here.
Rex is at the exact same coordinates, and he's not here.
This is getting interesting.
(GARBLED) Unable to find you.
Where are you, sir?
Something's blocking the signal.
(EQUIPMENT POWERING DOWN)
Not good.
Everything's dead.
Even the life support.
This is really strange.
(POWERING UP)
There.
See?
Nothing to be concerned about after all.
Then what's that?
It's pulling us towards it.
Everyone, strap yourselves in.
Looks as though we're going for a ride.
(SIGHING GROGGILY)
I must have blacked out.
Then who landed the shuttle?
Not me.
Where are we?
Some kind of organic mass.
All of our readings indicate that it's bigger than an asteroid.
But at least the atmosphere is breathable.
Well, this is getting more unusual by the minute.
I can't even lock down where in the galaxy we are, or if we are even in our own galaxy.
Well, the ship's systems seem fine, but for whatever reason, nothing's working.
Hey!
I saw something.
A reflection, up on the hill.
I don't see anything.
FEMALE VOICE:
Are you the one?
What the...
What?
Did you hear that?
I didn't hear anything.
Are you the one?
-Hello!
-Who are you?
I am Daughter.
Are you the one?
Uh, the one what?
I will take you to him.
Him, who?
Did you bring us here?
Only he can help you.
There is little time.
Follow me.
We must have shelter by nightfall.
And we thought the planet was strange.
How about this one?
We'll be fine as long as we stay together.
Have you noticed the seasons seem to change with the time of day?
Yeah.
And there are no animals.
-And you sense it?
-Mmm-hmm.
Since we arrived.
The Force is very strong.
An intersection unlike anything I've ever felt before.
Be wary.
Excuse me.
Who are you taking us to?
The father, of course.
Of course!
And what exactly are you?
We are the ones who guard the power.
We are the middle, the beginning and the end.
Glad she cleared that up for us.
Hey!
Look out!
(GRUNTING)
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
(SHARPLY) It is forbidden for you to touch me.
Sorry.
I was just saving your life.
That was my brother's work.
You are in great danger.
Wait for me.
Do not leave this place.
Hey.
Wait!
OBI-WAN:
Anakin, are you there?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
But our friend here has run off!
Go back to the ship and try sending another distress call.
I'll follow her and find out how to get off this rock.
And if this is a trap?
Then I'm not gonna wait around to find out.
Anakin, stop!
Wait for us to find another way around and meet you.
-(STATIC)
-Anakin?
So reckless and impatient.
He'll find her.
Yes, and what else?
Storm's coming.
-The ship's gone!
-Yes, I see that.
It was here, no question.
And look, everything's dying.
Did you lose something?
You didn't do as you were asked.
And what was that?
My sister said to wait!
Did she, now?
Well, we were unfortunately separated.
We'd like our ship back, if you don't mind.
Not yet.
Is it true that he is the Chosen One?
What do you know of such things?
What is about to happen shall occur, whether you like it or not.
You are Sith!
Sith?
(CHUCKLING)
Yes.
And no.
The storms here are quite lethal.
If you want to live, I suggest you find shelter.
What in the universe was that?
I'm not quite sure.
Quick.
There's a cave over there.
Whoever I'm looking for is in that monastery.
Welcome, my friend.
What is it that you want from me?
To learn the truth about who you really are.
One that maybe you have known all along.
One you must believe in order to fulfill your destiny.
Enough with the riddles, old man.
Tell me what's going on here.
As you can see, there is nowhere else to go.
It is late.
You will be my guest tonight.
Obi-Wan, have you done as I asked?
Have you trained the boy?
Master Qui-Gon?
How are you here?
I am here because you are here.
No.
I don't understand.
What is this place?
Unlike any other, a conduit through which the entire force of the universe flows.
Are we in danger?
This planet is both an amplifier and a magnet.
Three are here who seek Skywalker.
They, like me, believe him to be the Chosen One.
You were right, the Force within him is stronger than any known Jedi.
I have trained him as well as I could, but he's still willful and balance eludes him.
If he is the Chosen One, he will discover it here.
And if not?
Then you must realize, with his power, this is a very dangerous place for him to be.
Wake up, my son.
I must tell you a secret.
Who's there?
Who's there, I said?
It is me, Ani.
Your mother.
What kind of black arts is this?
You're dead.
Nothing ever really dies, my son.
I have a secret to tell you.
Then tell me.
Everything you have done, everything you have learned, has led you here.
Whatever you are, my mother is...
-Is dead.
-And you blame yourself.
Your Jedi training has served you well, Ani, but you are more than a Jedi.
Tell me, where is your pain, so I might take it away?
I was too late to save you.
I failed as a Jedi, and I failed you.
How so?
I tasted only vengeance when I slaughtered so many to avenge your death.

- HOT IN CLEVELAND IS RECORDED
IN FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.
HAPPY SHARED FAKE BIRTHDAY, EVERYONE.
both:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
- SO WHAT ARE WE GETTING EACH OTHER
FOR OUR FAKE BIRTHDAY THIS YEAR?
- WE'RE GETTING EACH OTHER DATES,
JUST LIKE WE DID LAST YEAR.
- BUT LAST YEAR WAS A DISASTER.
- I STILL HAVEN'T RECOVERED FROM MY FIX-UP WITH CHESTER.
YOU KNOW, WITH THE MAN BOOBS.
- I HEAR HE'S MARRIED NOW
AND HAS A BABY.
- HMM.
I WONDER WHO'S FEEDING IT.
- WE'RE GETTING EACH OTHER DATES.
AND HERE'S WHO I WANT.
- JACK HUNTINGTON?
WOW, HE'S HANDSOME.
- AND RICH.
I'M STEERING MY BOAT IN A WHOLE NEW DIRECTION--
HOT AND LOADED.
- SO IT'S REALLY OVER WITH MAX?
- HE HOOKED UP WITH A YOUNGER WOMAN.
SOME 80-YEAR-OLD BIMBO.
- APPARENTLY, SHE FAWNS ALL OVER HIM.
- WHY ARE MEN SUCH SUCKERS
FOR WOMEN WHO ARE DUMB AND ADORING?
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW I'M GONNA BE TO GET JACK.
SO HOOK ME UP, BONY-MARONI.
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I WANT TO GO ANOTHER WAY TOO.
CAN YOU FIND ME SOMEBODY LAID-BACK?
MAYBE WITH A BEARD, LONG HAIR.
I'VE NEVER HAD THAT BEFORE.
- I KNOW JUST THE FELLA.
- WELL, IF WE'RE PICKING WHAT KIND OF MEN WE WANT,
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A THING FOR ROBERT DE NIRO.
- I HEAR HE ONLY DIGS BLACK CHICKS.
- WELL, THEN, FIND ME A MAN WHO'S LIKE DE NIRO
BUT FANCIES PASTY WHITE WOMEN.
OH, MIX IN A BIT OF PACINO,
ADD A HINT OF SEINFELD FOR LAUGHS.
OOH, AND A DASH OF SEAN CONNERY CIRCA 1968.
- DONE.
- REALLY?
I MEAN, HOW ON EARTH--
- BUH-BUH-BUH.
DONE.
AND AS FOR ME, MELANIE, MY REQUIREMENTS ARE SIMPLE.
NO MAN BOOBS.
NOTHING ABNORMALLY LARGE OR SMALL.
NO THIRD ANYTHING.
JUST YOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL, RICH, HANDSOME MAN.
- SO HOW OLD ARE WE TURNING THIS YEAR?
- HOW ABOUT 42?
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
- OH, I CAN'T PASS FOR 42.
PUT ME DOWN FOR 50.
- ELKA, WHAT HAVE WE SAID ABOUT USING THE "F" WORD?
- TO REVIEW, IF ANY ONE OF US NEEDS HELP,
WE USE OUR FAKE LAUGH.
- BUT I'M IN BIMBO MODE.
I'LL BE FAKE-LAUGHING ALL NIGHT.
[giggles] [high-pitched] OH, JACK.
YOU'RE SO HANDSOME AND SMART.
I GOT THIS.
- HIS ASSISTANT SAID HE WAS RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.
HE'S FLYING IN FROM CINCINNATI.
PRIVATE PLANE.
- I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS THAT RICH.
MAYBE I BETTER GO DUMBER.
- OH, JOY, THERE'S YOUR DATE.
- THAT'S HIM?
THE GUY IN THE BROWN SHIRT, BROWN PANTS, AND BROWN SHOES?
PLEASE TELL ME HE'S NOT AS DULL AS HE LOOKS.
- OH, KENNY, THIS IS JOY.
- HI, KENNY.
- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.
FUNNY THING, I DON'T USUALLY GO OUT ON A TUESDAY NIGHT.
USUALLY THURSDAYS.
ALTHOUGH TODAY FEELS SOMETHING LIKE A WEDNESDAY.
PROBABLY BECAUSE MONDAY WAS A HOLIDAY.
I'M SORRY.
I'M BEING RUDE.
WHAT DAY DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO YOU?
- LONGEST DAY OF MY LIFE.
WHY DON'T YOU FIND US A TABLE,
AND I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
- SURE.
- YOU WAITED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE AGAIN, DIDN'T YOU?
- WAITED TILL THE LAST MINUTE, YES,
AND FOUND THE WRONG GUY, NO.
NOW WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER THERE
AND FIND OUT WHAT BROWN CAN DO FOR YOU.
- OH, VICTORIA, THERE'S YOUR DATE AT THE END OF THE BAR.
HIS NAME IS TIMOTHY.
HE'S A BENEFACTOR
AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART.
AND, CHECK IT, NO MAN CLEAVAGE.
- SOLD.
- [giggles]
- OH, HERE COMES YOUR DATE.
DR. DOUG.
- JESUS.
- CUTE, HUH?
- NO.
HE LOOKS LIKE JESUS.
ELKA, I CAN'T DATE JESUS.
THAT'S A SIN.
AND IF IT ISN'T, IT SHOULD BE.
- RELAX.
IF YOU DON'T LIKE HIM,
IT'LL BE YOUR LAST SUPPER.
[sputters]
- HEY, ELKA.
OH, YOU MUST BE MELANIE.
I'M DOUG.
- HI.
- HE'S A HOLISTIC VETERINARIAN.
ANIMALS COME TO HIM CRIPPLED AND SICK,
AND HE HEALS 'EM ALL.
- WOW, YOU SOUND LIKE A MIRACLE WORKER.
- WELL, I GUESS I JUST HAVE THE TOUCH.
UH, SHALL WE FIND A TABLE?
OH, THAT ONE OVER THERE LOOKS FREE.
- SURE.
GREAT.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
THANKS.
- OH.
OKAY.
- PROBABLY DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE JESUS, RIGHT?
I'M JUST FREAKING OUT OVER NOTHING.
OH, DEAR LORD.
- HI, I'M ROY.
YOU READY TO ORDER?
- NOT JUST YET.
I'M WAITING FOR MY DATE.
- OH, GOOD, 'CAUSE MY FEET ARE KILLING ME.
[groans]
FIRST NIGHT ON THE JOB.
I DON'T REALLY NEED THE MONEY,
BUT I JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE, TRY SOMETHING NEW.
SO WHAT'S YOUR STORY?
- I'M TURNING FAKE 50 TODAY.
- WHOA-HO!
WELL, YOU DON'T LOOK A DAY OVER FAKE 45.
SO WHO'D KEEP A GORGEOUS CREATURE LIKE YOU WAITING?
- A GORGEOUS CREATURE LIKE HIM.
- OH.
THAT'S WHAT YOU GO FOR.
PRETTY BOYS.
- ELKA?
- [high-pitched] JACK?
- SORRY I'M LATE, DARLING,
BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF TRAFFIC.
- ON THE ROAD OR IN THE SKY?
- ACTUALLY, BOTH.
- [giggles]
OH, JACK, YOU ARE SO SMART AND HANDSOME.
- AND YOU ARE SO DELIGHTFUL.
WE'LL HAVE A BOTTLE OF DOM PERIGNON
AND SOME ZUCCHINI STICKS.
- OH, YOU SPEAK BOTH FRENCH AND ITALIAN.
- AND I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT REALIZED
THEY HUNG THE ROTHKO UPSIDE-DOWN.
- [laughs]
EXCUSE ME, WOULD YOU MIND SCOOCHING DOWN A STOOL?
MY DATE AND I WOULD LIKE TO SIT TOGETHER.
- NO PROBLEM.
- I'M SORRY, I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE YOU.
VICTORIA, THIS IS MY BROTHER, RICHARD.
- AN UPSIDE-DOWN ROTHKO.
[fake laughs]
- SIAMESE TWINS?
- NO WAY.
ARE YOU SURE?
- OH, I'M SURE.
MY SIAMESE TWINS-DAR HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN.
- VICTORIA, I HAD NO IDEA.
I MET TIMOTHY AT A BENEFIT AT THE ART MUSEUM,
AND IT WAS SUPER CROWDED.
WE WERE PACKED IN LIKE SARDINES.
I MEAN, IT COULD HAVE BEEN A CONVENTION OF SIAMESE TWINS
FOR ALL I KNEW.
- AT LEAST YOU GOT A SHOT AT ONE OF YOUR DATES
BEING INTERESTING.
- MAYBE MY DATE COULD PART THEM.
- HE'S JESUS, NOT MOSES.
- ALL RIGHT, MELANIE, I DON'T CARE HOW CROWDED IT WAS.
HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE NOTICED THIS?
- I WAS A LITTLE BUSY LOOKING FOR MEN WITHOUT BREASTS.
IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK IN CLEVELAND.
- OH, WELL, I GUESS I BETTER GET UP.
THIS GUY'S A RIOT.
- THIS GUY?
- I TOLD HIM SOMEONE JUST TOOK THE LAST ORDER OF SALMON.
LISTEN TO THIS.
- [as Al Pacino] YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER,
I'M OUT OF ORDER.
THIS WHOLE RESTAURANT'S OUT OF ORDER.
- [laughing] AL PACINO.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
- [as Sean Connery] DO YOU MEAN IT, MONEYPENNY?
OR ARE YOU JUST BLOWING SMOKE UP MY KILT?
[laughter]
- NOW HE'S JAMES BOND.
THIS GUY.
- MY GOD, YOU'RE AMAZING.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING IMPRESSIONS?
- WELL, I STARTED WHEN I WAS 10 OR 11.
NO, NO, NO, I WAS 10.
SEE, THIS IS EASY,
BECAUSE I WAS IN FIFTH GRADE,
AND WHEN YOU'RE IN KINDERGARTEN,
YOU'RE FIVE.
AND THEN YOU ADD FIVE.
YEAH, THAT'S 10.
AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED
DOING IMPRESSIONS
AND MONSTER MODEL MAKING.
MY BEST ONE'S FRANKENSTEIN.
- HEY, KENNY,
WHAT IF ROBERT DE NIRO LIKED TO BUILD MODELS OF FRANKENSTEIN?
- [as Robert De Niro] LOOK AT ME, HUH?
I AM THE FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER, HUH?
I HAVE BOLTS IN MY LITTLE NECK.
I AM ELECTRIC AND SCARY.
WHOA.
- [giggles]
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT IF DE NIRO, PACINO, AND SEAN CONNERY
WERE ALL FIGHTING OVER WHO GOT TO MARRY ME?
- [as Connery] LET'S DO THIS THE CHICAGO WAY.
[as Pacino] NO, WE'RE GONNA DO IT MY WAY.
YOU'RE GONNA MARRY ME, JOY.
HOO-AH!
[as De Niro] HEY, ARE YOU GONNA MARRY ME?
'CAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE,
SO YOU MUST BE MARRYING ME.
- I WAS BORN IN A SMALL TOWN IN PENNSYLVANIA.
YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF IT.
- BETHLEHEM?
- LATROBE.
CAN I REFILL YOUR WINE?
- YES, PLEASE.
- OH, IT SEEMS WE'RE OUT OF WINE.
- THERE'S PLENTY MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM.
- OF COURSE THERE IS.
- IT IS SO EXCITING FOR A GIRL LIKE I
TO BE OUT WITH SOMEONE IN THE TIRE BUSINESS.
- WELL, IT'S EXCITING FOR ME TO BE OUT
WITH SOMEONE WHO GETS HOW EXCITING IT IS.
- IT'S EXCITING FOR A WAITER LIKE I
TO BE DELIVERING YOUR BREAD.
- OOH, WHAT A BIG WATCH.
YOU MUST HAVE VERY STRONG WRISTS.
- YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, THERE'S A STORY THAT GOES WITH THIS.
THIS IS-- IT'S A ROLEX PRESIDENT.
IT WAS A GIFT FROM JACK KENNEDY.
YEAH, THERE WAS A TIME WE WERE KNOWN AS THE TWO JACKS
AT CERTAIN WATERING HOLES ON THE CAPE.
- I BET ALL THE GIRLS LIKED YOU BEST.
- WELL, HE DID HAVE THE BAD BACK, THOUGH.
- I KNOW.
- SO MELANIE REALLY NEVER MENTIONED
THAT RICHARD AND I ARE CONJOINED?
- YOU KNOW, SHE PROBABLY DID, AND I JUST FORGOT.
- WELL, I WATCH YOUR SHOW, OH, HI!
OHIO!
ALL THE TIME.
I LOVE THE WAY YOU ALWAYS SAY EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
- OH, NOT ALWAYS.
- YOU KNOW, RICHARD AND I HAVE A PRETTY COMPELLING STORY.
- OH, REALLY, WHAT IS IT?
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
- I'VE BEEN DIVORCED TWICE,
NO KIDS.
SHOOTING BLANKS.
IT'S A SPERM THING.
- THAT'S TOO BAD.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I WONDER--
HOW JERRY SEINFELD MIGHT FEEL ABOUT HAVING A LOW SPERM COUNT.
- [as Jerry Seinfeld] WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS THIS,
WHO'S ACTUALLY COUNTING THE SPERM?
THIS IS NOT A GOOD JOB.
YOUR MOTHER CAN'T BRAG TO HER FRIENDS ABOUT IT.
"FELLAS, HAVE YOU MET MY SON?
"HE COUNTS SPERM.
WE'RE VERY PROUD."
- [laughs]
NOW DO ROBIN WILLIAMS WITHOUT SPERM.
- [as Robin Williams] OH, MY GOODNESS.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE-- OH, THEY'RE GONE.
HELP ME.
OKAY.
- [laughs]
- LOOK, I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING YOU TWO
AS I WAS TAKING A BREAK WITH THIS NICE COUPLE
WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONG TOGETHER,
AS OPPOSED TO YOU TWO, WHO I WOULD CALL A BAD FIT.
- AREN'T YOU OUR WAITER?
- I WAS ALSO A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
FOR MANY YEARS.
SON, SHE'S ONLY AFTER YOU FOR YOUR IMPRESSIONS.
- HOW DARE YOU.
TELL HIM OFF.
AS WILLIAM SHATNER.
- AS I USED TO TELL MY STUDENTS,
YOU GOT TO APPLY TO THE SCHOOL THAT'S GONNA LET YOU IN.
- BUT SHE'S SO PRETTY.
- OH, SHE'S A DOLL.
BUT THE GIRL AT THE BAR ISN'T BAD EITHER,
AND SHE APPEARS TO HAVE A VERY LOOSE ADMISSIONS POLICY.
- WAIT, YOU CAN'T TAKE MY DATE AWAY FROM ME.
- CAN YOU HONESTLY SAY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HIM?
- YES, I FIND HIM CHARMING AND ATTRACTIVE.
- WHEN HE'S HIM?
- NO.
OH, FINE, GO.
- COME ON.
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO HER.
- [as William Shatner] WHY MUST LOVE BE SO COMPLICATED?
WHY MUST OUR PLANET BE FILLED WITH BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
WHO EXIST SIMPLY TO...
BREAK OUR HEARTS?
- WAIT!
WAIT, NOW I WANT YOU BACK!
WELL, NOW I DON'T EVEN HAVE A DATE.
THE WAITER FIXED HIM UP WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
- I WISH HE'D BREAK UP MY DATE WITH JESUS.
I'D BREAK UP WITH HIM MYSELF,
BUT HE'D JUST SHOW UP THREE DAYS LATER.
- DO WE REALLY WANT TO PLAY WHO HAS THE WORST DATE?
BECAUSE I AM ON A DATE WITH CONJOINED TWINS.
- I'LL BET MAN BOOBS ARE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD TO YOU RIGHT NOW.
- LOOK, IF I CAN SUCK IT UP WITH JESUS--
OH, GOD, THAT JUST SOUNDS SO WRONG--
CAN'T YOU JUST STICK IT OUT WITH TIMOTHY?
- I AM ON A DATE WITH CONJOINED TWINS.
- BUT HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY.
- I AM ON A DATE WITH CONJOINED TWINS.
- I KNOW.
BUT STILL THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS.
- ARE THEY HUMAN BEINGS
OR HUMAN BEING?
'CAUSE I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
- MY DATE'S GOING GREAT.
HE THINKS I'M AN IDIOT.
- I'M GOING HOME.
- OH, NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, NO.
YOU'RE DATELESS, AND I HAVE TWO DATES.
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, COME AND SIT WITH ME.
YOU CAN BE THE FOURTH WHEEL
OR THE THIRD AND A HALF WHEEL.
I JUST-- I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
- SINCE IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE HAVING DINNER HERE,
HOW ABOUT WE TAKE A DRIVE UP TO MY LAKE HOUSE?
I'LL HAVE MY PRIVATE CHEF WHIP US UP
A LITTLE SOMETHING SPECIAL.
- EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS SO INTERESTING.
- OH, BOY, YOU GUYS MUST BE STARVING.
- NEVER MIND.
JUST BRING US THE CHECK, PLEASE.
WE'RE GOING BACK TO MY PLACE.
- OH.
MIGHT WANT TO FIX YOUR HAIR FIRST.
- WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?
- LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.
THE 'DO'S GETTING A LITTLE...
TRUMPY.
- ELKA, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING.
NOBODY LOOK.
NOBODY LOOK, PLEASE.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN GIRLS LIKE YOU PLAYING DUMB
TO GET THE BOY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?
YOU END UP PREGNANT,
AND THERE'S NO GRADUATION GOWN IN THE WORLD CAN COVER IT.
- YOU KNOW, IN SOME WAYS,
THIS ISN'T ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.
- WELL, IN SOME WAY, IT IS.
I SEE A SADNESS BEHIND YOUR EYES.
AND I KNOW BECAUSE I SEE THE SAME THING
WHEN I LOOK INTO A MIRROR.
I LOST MY WIFE RECENTLY.
THAT'S WHY I'M OUT DOING THIS THING.
WHAT DID YOU LOSE?
- I LOST MY MAX.
- CANCER?
- WORSE.
FLORIDA.
YOU KNOW, MAX AND I MET RIGHT AT THIS EXACT SPOT
A YEAR AGO.
- I KNOW IT HURTS,
BUT JUMPING TO THE NEXT GUY
ISN'T GONNA MAKE IT ANY BETTER.
SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO SIT WITH THE PAIN.
- SO YOU CAN NEVER FLY FIRST CLASS?
- NO, THE ARM RESTS ONLY GO UP IN COACH.
- OH, THAT IS SO SAD.
- I LOVE ENGLAND.
I GET TO DRIVE THERE.
- OH, RIGHT.
YOU'RE READING YEATS.
- MM.
"NOW THAT MY LADDER IS GONE,
I MUST LIE DOWN WHERE ALL LADDERS START."
- "IN THE FOUL RAG-AND-BONE SHOP OF THE HEART."
- OH.
- SO ON FACEBOOK, ONE PAGE OR TWO?
- I'M REALLY ENJOYING BEING WITH YOU.
- AND ALSO WITH YOU.
I MEAN, I'M ENJOYING YOU TOO.
- REALLY?
BECAUSE YOU SEEM A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.
- SHE'S COMPLETELY FREAKED OUT
BECAUSE SHE THINKS YOU LOOK LIKE JESUS.
- YEAH.
WELL, THERE IS THAT.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT BUMBLING WAITER
WAS TALKING ABOUT.
MY HAIR IS PERFECT.
WELL, LIKE THEY SAY IN THE RUBBER BUSINESS,
LET'S BOUNCE.
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- WHY NOT?
I THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING A GREAT TIME.
BESIDES, I HAVE NEVER ENJOYED CHATTING WITH A WOMAN MORE.
- TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL GO WITH YOU
IF YOU CAN TELL ME ONE THING
YOU LEARNED ABOUT ME TONIGHT.
- WELL, UH... [laughs] WHEN--WHEN, UH...
- EXACTLY.
I'M SORRY IF I LED YOU ON.
- ME TOO.
- GOOD NIGHT, JACK.
- GOOD NIGHT, ELKA.
IT WASN'T THE HAIR, WAS IT?
'CAUSE IF IT WAS, IT WOULD--IT WOULD HAUNT ME.
- WHY DO MEN LIKE DUMB WOMEN?
- WELL, NOT ALL MEN.
I LIKE SMART WOMEN.
- MAYBE YOU AND I...
- OH, WELL, NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
LET ME JUST ADD A COUPLE OF ZEROS TO MY TIP
AND DINNER'S ON ME.
- WELL, WHEN IT COMES TO FRENCH MOVIES,
I GO FOR THE PRETENTIOUSNESS BUT I STAY FOR THE SEX.
- HEY, THERE'S A TRUFFAUT DOUBLE FEATURE AT THE ART HOUSE
AROUND THE CORNER.
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SOMETIME.
- WHY DON'T THE TWO OF US SNEAK OUT NOW?
OH.
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT SEPARATING?
- WE LOOKED INTO IT.
BUT IT'S JUST TOO RISKY MEDICALLY.
- IS THIS A DEAL BREAKER FOR YOU?
- TO BE HONEST, I'M NOT SURE.
- HEY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
BUT OUR DATES ARE OVER,
SO WE WERE JUST GONNA HEAD ON HOME.
- YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S GETTING LATE,
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD SAY GOOD NIGHT AS WELL.
- NO.
YOU GO AHEAD.
I'M STAYING.
- REALLY?
- YES.
I'M SO QUICK TO REJECT ANY MAN
WHO DOESN'T FALL INTO SOME NARROW VIEW
OF WHAT I THINK IS THE RIGHT GUY.
BUT NOT THIS TIME.
I SEE GOODNESS AND HONESTY WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES.
- RICHARD, YOU LYING, CHEATING RAT BASTARD!
GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY HUSBAND.
- YOU'RE MARRIED, AND YOU WERE HITTING ON ME?
- I'M CONJOINED.
I'M NOT DEAD.
- SO IT DIDN'T WORK OUT WITH THAT OTHER WOMAN EITHER?
- [as Bill Clinton] I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL FEELINGS
FOR THAT WOMAN.
[laughter]
- HOW WOULD GEORGE BUSH FEEL ABOUT THAT WOMAN?
- [as George W. Bush] WELL, I DECIDED SHE WASN'T
RIGHT FOR ME, 'CAUSE I'M THE DECIDER.
AND THESE ARE THE DECIDER HOUSE RULES.
[laughter]
- HE JUST PICKED UP.
DO IT.
- [as Connery] MAX, SEAN CONNERY HERE.
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M IN BED
WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL AND SMART EX-GIRLFRIEND ELKA.
AND TOGETHER WE'RE LAUGHING ABOUT YOUR CLUMSY LOVE-MAKING.
[laughter]
"Hot in Cleveland" is recorded in front of a live studio audience.
Happy shared fake-birthday everyone!
Happy birthday.
So what are we geting each other for our fake birthday this year?
We're getting each other dates.
Just like we did last year.
But last year was a disaster.
I still haven't recovered from my fix-up with Chester.
You know, with the man boobs.
I hear he's married now and has a baby.
Hmm.
I wonder who's feeding it.
We're getting each other dates.
And here's who I want.
Jack Huntington?
Wow, he's handsome.
And rich.
I'm steering my boat in a whole new direction- hot and loaded.
So it's really over with Max?
He hooked up with a younger woman.
Some 80-year-old bimbo.
Apparently, she fawns all over him.
Why are men such suckers for women who are dumb and adoring?
I don't know, but that's exactly how I'm gonna be to get Jack.
So hook me up, bony-maroni.
You know what, I want to go another way too.
Can you find me somebody laid-back?
Maybe with a beard, long hair.
I've never had that before.
I know just the fella.
Well, if we're picking what kind of men we want,
I've always had a thing for Robert De Niro.
I hear he only digs black chicks.
Well, then, find me a man who's like De Niro, but fancies pasty, white women.
Oh, mix in a bit of Pacino, add a hint of Seinfeld for laughs.
Ooh, and a dash of Sean Connery circa 1968.
Done.
Really?
I mean, how on earth-
Buh-buh-buh.
Done.
And as for me, Melanie, my requirements are simple.
No man boobs.
Nothing abnormally large or small.
No third anything.
Just your run-of-the-mill, rich, handsome man.
So how old are we turning this year?
How about 42?
That sounds good to me.
